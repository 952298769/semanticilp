The first sign of cleavage is the appearance of a cleavage furrow, a shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate . On the cytoplasmic side of the furrow is a contractile ring of actin microfilaments associated with molecules of the protein myosin. The actin microfilaments interact with the myosin molecules, causing the ring to contract. The contraction of the dividing cell's ring of microfilaments is like the pulling of a drawstring. The cleavage furrow deepens until the parent cell is pinched in two, producing two completely separated cells, each with its own nucleus and share of cytosol, organelles, and other subcellular structures.","qas":[{"question":"What is necessary for the appearance of a cleavage furrow?","answers":[{"text":"In","answer_start":0}],"id":"34-0"},{"question":"Which entity is part of the contractile ring?","answers":[{"text":"In","answer_start":0}],"id":"34-1"},{"question":"What is produced by the cleavage furrow deepening?","answers":[{"text":"In","answer_start":0}],"id":"34-2"}]}]},{"title":"bestTitleEva","paragraphs":[{"context":"Cytokinesis in plant cells, which have cell walls, is markedly different. There is no cleavage furrow. Instead, during telophase, vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cell, where they coalesce, producing a cell plate . Cell wall materials carried in the vesicles collect in the cell plate as it grows. The cell plate enlarges until its surrounding membrane fuses with the plasma membrane along the perimeter of the cell. Two daughter cells result, each with its own plasma membrane. Meanwhile, a new cell wall arising from the contents of the cell plate has formed between the daughter cells. Figure 12.11 Mitosis in a plant cell.

Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons  and giving off O2 as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called NADP+ , where they are temporarily stored. The electron acceptor NADP+ is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an H+. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of electrons as \"reducing power\" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells.

The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons  enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group , and two different carbons  leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules . The acetyl group of acetyl CoA joins the cycle by combining with the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate .  The next seven steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate. It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that makes this process a cycle. Now let's tally the energy-rich molecules produced by the citric acid cycle. For each acetyl group entering the cycle, 3 NAD+ are reduced to NADH . In step 6, electrons are transferred not to NAD+, but to FAD, which accepts 2 electrons and 2 protons to become FADH2. In many animal tissue cells, step 5 produces a guanosine triphosphate  molecule by substrate-level phosphorylation, as shown in Figure 9.12. GTP is a molecule similar to ATP in its structure and cellular function. This GTP may be used to make an ATP molecule  or directly power work in the cell.

Reception is the target cell's detection of a signaling molecule coming from outside the cell. A chemical signal is \"detected\" when the signaling molecule binds to a receptor protein located at the cell's surface or inside the cell. Transduction. The binding of the signaling molecule changes the receptor protein in some way, initiating the process of transduction. The transduction stage converts the signal to a form that can bring about a specific cellular response. In Sutherland's system, the binding of epinephrine to a receptor protein in a liver cell's plasma membrane leads to activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Transduction sometimes occurs in a single step but more often requires a sequence of changes in a series of different molecules: a signal transduction pathway. The molecules in the pathway are often called relay molecules. Response. In the third stage of cell signaling, the transduced signal finally triggers a specific cellular response. The response may be almost any imaginable cellular activity: such as catalysis by an enzyme , rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, or activation of specific genes in the nucleus.
