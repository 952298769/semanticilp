important for biotechnology (to be discussed later) Sexual Reproduction: most eukaryotic organisms have this capacity Formation of sperm & egg = Meiosis Animals - this occurs in ovary & testes Plants - this occurs in ovaries (at the base of the stigma) & stamen Fertilization (or pollination in plants) forms a zygote (2 sets of chromosomes) zygote develops into an embryo by mitosis & cells differentiate Animals = developing offspring is called a fetus Plants = seeds are the equivalent of an embryo Meiosis Chromosomes are single-stranded Chromosomes become double-stranded (duplicate)

Alternation of generations Plant life cycles alternate between a diploid (sporophyte) stage and a haploid (gametophyte) stage Gametophyte stage All cells are haploid Begins with a spore - produced from a meiotic division of a diploid spore mother cell Ends with a gamete - produced from mitotic divisions of the gametophyte Gametophyte stage of primitive plants may be as conspicuous as the sporophyte stage Sporophyte stage All cells are diploid Begins with a zygote - produced by fertilization Additional cells of sporophyte are produced by mitosis Ends with a spore mother cell, which

becomes visible Spindle fibers begin to extend from centrioles Metaphase Sister chromatids line up down the center of the cell Anaphase Sister chromatids separate at the centromere Telo phase Sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides Cytokinesis occurs (cytoplasm gets divided in half) Phases of Meiosis Similar process Differences: Two consecutive divisions without DNA replication First sequence separates two intact sets of chromosomes chromosomes do not split at the centromere form two new cells - haploid (one complete set of chromosomes) however, each still has 2 sister chromatids
