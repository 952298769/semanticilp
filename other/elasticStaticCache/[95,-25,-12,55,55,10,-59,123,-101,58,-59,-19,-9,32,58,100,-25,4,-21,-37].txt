one half, or one quarter, of their alleles will be the same grandparents share one quarter of their alleles with grandchildren this fraction of alleles that two individuals share is their \"coefficient of relatedness\" the higher the coefficient of relatedness, the more alleles in common, and the closer the relationship parent-offspring: 0.5 sibling-sibling: 0.5 half-sibling: 0.25 grandparent-grandchild: 0.25 sibling's offspring (uncle-nephew, etc.): 0.25 unrelated: 0.0 The key to kin selection: What affects evolution is how many copies of an individual's alleles get into the next generation it does not matter if they get into the next generation through the individual's own offspring or through the offspring of relatives the only difference is that relatives have only some of an individual's alleles, so it will take more of their offspring to get the same number of copies of the individual's alleles into the next generation Example of kin selection Your own offspring carry 50% of your alleles Your sibling's offspring carry 25% of your alleles So if you do something that increases your sibling's reproductive success by two offspring, the effect is exactly the same as if you had one more child yourself If your action does not reduce your own reproductive success much, then the tendency to do that action will become more common as far as evolution is concerned, two children of siblings are equivalent to one of your own the same comparisons can be made with all other relatives two grandchildren carry as many of your alleles as one of your own children, and so on two nephews are equivalent to one child four great-grandchildren are equivalent to one child, etc. what we are doing here is correcting an oversimplification in our model of evolution before, we said that natural selection favored traits that increased an individual's reproductive success where reproductive success was measured by how many offspring that individual contributed to the next generation now, with a knowledge of genes, we can revise that New version: Natural selection favors traits that increase inclusive fitness inclusive fitness : the total number of copies of an individual's alleles that are passed on to the next generation both directly, through offspring and indirectly, through the offspring of relatives this view of \"fitness\" that includes alleles passed on through relatives is called \"inclusive fitness\" natural selection does NOT simply favor traits that maximize reproductive success instead, natural selection favors traits that increase inclusive fitness inclusive fitness: the total number of alleles passed on to the next generation both directly through offspring and indirectly through relatives so now, say a bunch of baboon siblings are out foraging, and one sees leopard the one who sees the predators gives a warning call the caller incurs a cost, since it is slightly more likely to get eaten but the siblings get the benefit of being more likely to escape half of the siblings have the alleles that encourage giving warning calls, just because they are siblings of the caller if the total benefit to the siblings is large enough, it can outweigh the cost to the caller the net effect is that more of the calling alleles get into the next generation through the siblings than were lost by the possible demise of the caller that is, by considering inclusive fitness, we see that selection can actually favor traits that are fatal!",1.9350569248199463],["They do not need to get input from their siblings,
