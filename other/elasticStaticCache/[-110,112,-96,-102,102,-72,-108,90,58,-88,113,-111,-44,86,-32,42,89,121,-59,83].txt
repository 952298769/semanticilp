The other group will guess the objects that produce the sound. Assignment Remind the students to bring the following: 1. Maracas 2. Drum/box 3. Guitar 4. Whistle Activity 2: Ways of Producing Sound Duration: 1 day Background Information Sounds are produced by objects that vibrate. The vibrations of an object disturb the air in such a way that sounds are produced. Sounds travel in all direction from its source. Musical instruments produced sound because they are made to vibrate. The drum, cymbal, tambourine, and xylophone produced sound by beating them. They vibrate when they are beaten. The guitar, violin and cello produced sound by strumming them. Their strings vibrate producing sound. The flute, trumpet, and trombone produced sound when they are blown. The air inside them vibrates producing sound. Objective At the end of the lesson, the pupils can describe the different ways of producing sound.
