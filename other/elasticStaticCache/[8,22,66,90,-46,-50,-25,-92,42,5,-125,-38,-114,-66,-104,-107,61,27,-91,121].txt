referring to an igneous rock, fine grained minerals too small to be seen with the unaided eye batholith - a great irregular mass of coarse-grained igneous rock with an exposed surface of more than 100 km 2 , which has either intruded the country rock or been derived from it through metamorphism clastic - formed from clasts (particles) crystalline - of or pertaining to the nature of a crystal, crystal-like extrusive - formed from lava or other volcanic material spewed out onto the surface of the Earth felsic - description for a light-colored igneous rock that is poor in iron and magnesium and contains abundant feldspars and quartz fissile - capable of being easily split along closely spaced planes gneissic - pertaining to texture of gneisses, foliation igneous rock - a rock formed by the solidification of magma intrusive - igneous rock that forced its way in a molten state into the country rock mafic - used to describe rocks rich in mafic minerals which are dark colored minerals rich in iron and magnesium metamorphic rock - a rock whose original mineralogy, texture, or composition has been changed by the effects of pressure, temperature, or the gain or loss of chemical components metamorphism - the mineralogical, chemical, and structural adjustment of solid rocks to physical and chemical conditions imposed at depth below the surface zones of weathering and cementation mica - muscovite from mineral lab, monoclinic minerals, sheet silicates phaneritic - texture of an igneous rock in which the minerals can be seen with the unaided eye phyllitic - pertaining to the texture of a metamorphic rock intermediate in grade between slate and schist, may have a greenish appearance due to the presence of chlorite, is shiny and has a smooth, silky feel compared to schist plagioclase - collectively the group of triclinic feldspars schistose - rock displaying schistosity , appearance of schist sedimentary rock - a rock formed by the accumulation and cementation of mineral grains by wind, mater, or ice transportation to the site of deposition or by chemical precipitation slaty -
