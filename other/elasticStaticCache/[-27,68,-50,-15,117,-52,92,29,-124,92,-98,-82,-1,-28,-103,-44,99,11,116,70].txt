[["Mechanisms of Heat Transfer recall heat moves from areas of high temperature to low heat transfers can occur by four different mechanisms: a) radiation = emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation from an object ultimate source of energy driving nearly all life on earth is solar radiation&#151;absorbed by objects on earth (including plant photosynthetic pigments, rocks and soil, your skin, etc.)&#151;warmed up by absorbing solar radiation objects then typically re-radiate this energy as lower quality infrared radiation&#151;this re-radiation can then: escape the earth&#146;s atmosphere into space, cooling the Earth&#151;especially on a clear, cloudless night be again absorbed by substances in the atmosphere&#151;such as water vapor, clouds and carbon dioxide, which act like blankets trapping the heat and heating the Earth&#151;likened to effect of glass in a greenhouse",1.9116840362548828],["- ectotherms: most invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, amphibians - endotherms: birds, mammals - partial/temporary endotherms: \nsome insects and fishes - partial ectotherms: sun-basking mammals and birds Physical Properties of Heat Exchange * 4 kinds of heat exchange with physical environment * conduction: direct transfer of heat through contact between environment and organism - e.g. basking in sun, laying on a hot rock, sitting in a pool of water * convection: heat transfer resulting from movement of air or liquid past body surface - e.g. cooling effect of a breeze (some of this is due to evaporation) * radiation: emmission of electromagnetic waves produced by any object warmer than absolute zero (-273 );",1.7639644145965576],["* \"solar energy\" â€“ solar radiation used for hot water production and electricity generation (does not include passive solar energy to heat and cool buildings etc.);",1.689835548400879],["The heat from the ' Hot Water' in the inner coil never makes contact with the actual pond water but the heat generated from it is then transferred to the water flowing round it by radiation - hence it heats the water in your pond or tank .... simple !!",1.6650793552398682],["Heat transfer topics, including radiation, evaporation/condensation, and water cooling.",1.6609556674957275],["Advanced heat transfer, including radiation, evaporation/condensation, and water cooling.",1.6609556674957275],["Heat transfer topics, including radiation, evaporation/condensation, and water cooling.",1.6609556674957275],["HEG = Q abs + M \" R \" C \" LE \" G Where: HEG = heat energy gained Q abs = radiation absorbed by animal M = &#9;metabolic heat production R = &#9;infrared radiation received or emitted C = &#9;heat gained or lost by convection LE = &#9;heat gained by condensation or lost by evaporation G = &#9;heat gained or lost by direct contact with the substrate (ground) Q abs : Energy gained from absorption Shuttle from sun to shade Change orientation and posture Change color via melanophores (derived from neural crest cells) M: Enery from metabolism More pertinent to endotherms, but gigantothermy (e.g., sea turtles, pythons), muscle action with blood shunting are two ways ectotherms can contribute metabolic energy R: infrared radiation IR (in heat spectrum, not light) Rough skin more efficient at garnering infrared energy than smooth skin Marine iguanas absorb intense short-wave IR on dorsal surface, loss long-wave through ventral surface C: Convection Heat flux between body and ambient fluid If air behavioral mechanisms can reduce flux If water convection causes heat transfer from animal to environment LE: Evaporation/Condensation Gular flutter (via buccal pumping) or panting (via lungs) to cool off, provides a surface for evaporation Requires metabolic energy which increases heat G: Gain of heat via conduction from substrate Snakes lay flat on hot rocks Marine iguana stands off of ground Back to GVZ syllabus Back to T.
