Standard 10, Grades K-2 Knows that things can be done to materials to change some of their properties (e.g., heating, freezing, mixing, cutting, dissolving, bending), but not all materials respond the same way to what is done to them Science Standard 10, Grades 3-5 Knows that objects can be classified according to their properties (e.g., magnetism, conductivity, density, solubility) Science Standard 10, Grades 3-5 Knows that properties such as length, weight, temperature, and volume can be measured using appropriate tools (e.g., rulers, balances, thermometers, graduated cylinders) Science Standard 10, Grades 3-5 Knows that materials have different states (solid, liquid, gas), and some common materials such as water can be changed from one state to another by heating or cooling Science Standard 10, Grades 6-8 Knows that atoms often combine to form a molecule (or crystal), the smallest particle of a substance that retains its properties Science Standard 10, Grades 6-8 Knows that atoms are in constant, random motion (atoms in solids are close together and don't move about easily;",1.1227213144302368],["PROCESSING QUESTIONS: What are the most important things we all have
