and CaCO3 + H+ + HCO3- = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- - important action in limestone terrain where solution features lead to Karst Topography - responsible for hard water (Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) - some rocks can be completely dissolved and leached away, few outcrops exist except in deserts 22 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - reactions of minerals in rocks with oxygen to form oxides (hydroxides if water is present) - commonly occurs as rusting e.g. 4Fe + 3O2 = 2Fe2O3 (iron oxide or hematite) - oxidation of pyrite e.g. FeS2 + O2 + H2O = FeO(OH) + H2SO4 23 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - important in the alteration of Fe/Mg minerals (olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite) and mafic rocks (basalt and gabbro) where oxidation imparts a red color to altered basalt) - the production of acids from spoil banks (mine tailings) that are transported by runoff from rainfall into streams killing fish and making water unfit for drinking is of environmental concern 24 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 3) HYDROLYSIS -

Frost wedging - Frost wedging results from alternate freezing and thawing of water in cracks within rocks - as water freezes, volume increases by 9% -expansion exerts a force that is great enough to break the rocks 8 Page 9 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Requirements 1) pre-existing cracks or voids in rocks 2) adequate moisture (water) 3) temperature rises and falls below the freezing point of water - common in temperate climates, and high mountains in tropical regions 9 Page 10 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Talus Slope - an accumulation of weathered angular rock fragments at the bottom of steep slopes in large piles - formed in areas where frost action occurs on steep slopes 10 Page 11 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES Frost Heaving - a layer of loose rock or soil is lifted by the expansion of freezing water e.g. lifting of highway pavement during winter 11 Page 12 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES Salt Wedging - the growth and expansion of salt crystals induce stresses that break rocks, common in coastal areas and deserts Requirements 1) existing cracks 2) salt water supply 3) warm temperature for salt crystallization 12 Page 13 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) UNLOADING Sheeting - rock expands as overburden is removed by erosion, the overlying pressure diminishes (pressure release mechanical weathering ) - the increase in volume accommodated by the development of cracks and fractures parallel to the ground surface -
