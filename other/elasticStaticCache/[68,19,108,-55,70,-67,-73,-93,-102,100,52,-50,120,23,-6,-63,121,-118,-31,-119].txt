They have the ability to create and hear noises that humans cannot hear. The sound waves bounce off of objects and back to the bat, which can then judge the size and distance of the object. These subsonic noises vary in length and pulse frequency, and are unique to the individual. Each bat recognizes its own pulse reflections, or \"voice,\" and uses it to avoid objects and to identify food.",1.3350306749343872],["Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. [62] Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. [62] Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. [62] Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. [62] Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. [62] The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. [62] Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. [62] For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. [62] The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. [62] Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. [62] An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. [62] For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. [62] Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.

All actions (such as body movements, detection of objects of interest, or learning from others in a social group) begin with the acquisition of information. Thus, an animal’s sense organs are exceedingly important to its behaviour. They constitute a set of monitoring instruments with which the animal gathers information about itself and its environment. Each sense organ is selective, responding only to one particular form of energy; an instrument that responds indiscriminately to multiple forms of energy would be rather useless and similar to having none at all. The particular form of energy to which a sense organ responds determines its sensory modality. Three broad categories of sensory modalities are familiar to humans: chemoreception (exemplified by the senses of taste and smell but also including specialized receptors for pheromones and other behaviorally important molecules), mechanoreception (the basis for touch, hearing, balance, and many other senses, such as joint position), and photoreception (light sensitivity, including form and colour vision).",1.2022132873535156],["They must use their sense of hearing to determine where the ball is.",1.183941125869751],["In the cases in which neither vision nor hearing can be relied upon, the hands must largely assume the tasks of achieving exploratory competence, helping to gain a secure sense of object permanence and thereby a motivation for mobility, helping to construct a body image and sense of self in the world, and gaining the ability to express feelings and ideas in differentiated ways.",1.1746567487716675],["In the cases in which neither vision nor hearing can be relied upon, the hands must largely assume the tasks of achieving exploratory competence, helping to gain a secure sense of object permanence and thereby a motivation for mobility, helping to construct a body image and sense of self in the world, and gaining the ability to express feelings and ideas in differentiated ways.",1.1746567487716675],["Your ability to hear is another one of the senses that can be affected when using power tools.",1.1742652654647827],["Children at Risk for Hearing Problems The home hearing test explained here can be used to determine basic hearing ability of infants at different ages.",1.1527540683746338]]
