(pg. 320), the climate also began to change back and forth between warmer and cooler more rapidly, on a scale of just tens of thousands of years Potts suggests that rapid changes, rather than the hot or cool temperatures themselves, were the key also, Africa and Eurasia got close and joined, cutting off the Tethys sea leading to an exchange of animals and plants probably changing the ecology in many ways and allowing some species of early apes (genus Proconsul ) to spread out of Africa to more varied environments the Miocene hominoids (Miocene apes) Kenyapithecus , Oreopithecus , Dryopithecus , Sivapithecus , etc. general trend seems to have been towards more chewing -- eating harder or more fibrous foods presumably in response to the drying, more seasonal climate which would have encouraged woodier, tougher plants compared to the tropical rainforest Potts suggests that this trend was not so much a shifting focus but a broadening range of diet to deal with more rapidly varying conditions so that these apes could eat harder, more fibrous foods when necessary as climate and ecology shifted but were not necessarily limited to those foods when better ones were available Miocene hominoids had specific traits for heavy chewing molars had thick enamel, allowing for more wear and more pressure to be applied to break hard seeds molars had lower, rounded cusps, better for grinding, less specialized for shearing leaves - that is, suited to a tougher and more varied diet incidentally, this is a good time to note the \"U-shaped\" dental arcade (straight, parallel rows of teeth) that is typical of apes from the Late Oligocene on hominids differ on this, as we will see later more space for larger temporal muscles (the ones that pull the lower jaw up against the upper jaw) this is visible by looking at the space where the temporal muscle passes between the temporal bone of the brain case and the zygomatic arch this whole space is filled by the temporal muscle more massive mandible (lower jaw), to withstand the increased chewing forces at least two of the Miocene hominoids ( Dryopithecus and Oreopithecus ) are now known to have been arboreal, adapted to hanging by their arms like quadrumanual or brachiating apes unknown exactly how these hominoids relate to living primates we may not have found the species that were ancestral to the various modern hominoids (humans, gorillas, chimps, orangs, gibbons, siamangs) except Sivapithecus , which looks to be the ancestor, or a relative of the ancestor, of orangutans by the late Miocene and early Pliocene, many varieties of Miocene hominoids were going extinct only a few lineages survived leading to gorillas, chimps, orangutans, gibbons, siamangs, and us there used to be many more kinds of apes in the

how apes radiated (diversified) in the middle Miocene and that many of those ape varieties went extinct in the Late Miocene while the monkey lineages flourished and diversified This may have had to do with environmental changes the temperature was dropping rapidly tropical forests were shrinking leaving more open, grassland environments with groves of trees and temperate forests most of the apes are thought to have been forest dwellers remember that their long arms and grasping hands and feet seem to be arboreal adaptations so their territories may have shrunk and changed to the point that many of the arboreal apes could not survive around the end of the Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene, about 5 mya, one of the surviving kinds of apes responded to this stress in a completely new way: it became habitually bipedal the adaptations for arboreal life that arose among the Miocene hominoids incidentally also allowed for limited bipedalism on the ground much as gorillas, chimps, and gibbons can walk bipedally at times it is not hard to imagine that as trees got farther apart and there were more open spaces, natural selection might have favored apes that were better at bipedal walking this was the split that led to hominids important point: the first thing that really distinguished our lineage from all other primates was bipedalism not large brains, capable hands, or anything else that we know of unfortunately, we have very few fossils from the late Miocene, so we don't know much about which lineage of Miocene apes became bipedal or exactly what stages they went through to get there but we do know from DNA evidence that the lineage that led to the bipedal apes diverged from the lineages that led to chimps, bonobos, and gorillas around 7 to 5 mya that is, we and the other pongids (great apes) all stem from a common ancestral kind of ape that lived at the end of the Miocene, around 5 to 7 mya we also can be pretty sure that this transition to bipedalism happened in Africa there were Miocene apes in both Africa and tropical Asia but all of the remains of habitually bipedal apes prior to our own genus ( Homo ) have been found in Africa Specifically, in East and South Africa The bipedal apes are called hominids other than their form of locomotion, they weren't very different from other apes characteristics that set hominids (us and our closest relatives) apart from other apes habitual bipeds different jaws and teeth generally reduced size and strength of jaws small canines short, wide, &quot;parabolic&quot; dental arcade (shape of the whole row of teeth) some, but not all, had large molars in comparison to other teeth thick enamel on the molars this is a feature that had already appeared among some, but not all, Miocene apes slightly larger brain relative to body size the earliest hominids did not have all of these traits specifically, they didn't have the larger brains until later and the sides of the dental arcade were still pretty straight and almost parallel but since they are clearly separate from the other apes, and evolving in the direction of humans, we count these early bipeds in with the hominids The earliest hominids of which we have fossils are at least two species that date from around 4.4 mya to 3.9 mya still poorly known, based on teeth and a few larger fragments Ardipithecus ramidus (around 4.4 mya) mostly known from fairly apelike teeth molars are typical in size for apes enamel on molars is thin, as is typical for apes but the canines are relatively smaller than among other apes but the location of the foramen magnum is more forward than in other apes, hinting at habitual upright posture - and thus bipedalism recall that the foramen magnum is the hole in the base of the cranium through which the spinal cord connects to the brain but tends to be forward and underneath the head in \nupright animals that balance the head on top of the spinal column either due to bipedal walking or upright sitting or clinging in trees apparently lived in wooded areas based on seeds found with fossils and other animals including a kind of antelope that would have lived in temperate forest and colobine monkeys, which are now mostly forest dwellers Australopithecus anamensis (around 4.2 to 3.9 mya) mostly teeth, but some cranial, mandible, and limb fragments upper and lower jaws and teeth were quite similar to apes relatively U-shaped dental arcade receding chin but with some more hominid-like features reduced canines relatively enlarged molars thick enamel on the molars, indicating selection for grinding hard seeds knee joint suggests bipedalism and elbow joint is like ours, rather than like apes that use arms for support on the ground ape elbows lock in a straight position human elbows do not and neither did anamensis 's elbow so it probably did not lean on its arms much another indication of bipedalism so far, it seems reasonable to consider Ardipithecus ramidus an early member of the lineage that split from our common ancestor with chimps and Australopithecus anamensis as a likely descendant of Ardipithecus ramidus The earliest bipeds that we have relatively good evidence of so far date from roughly 4 mya to 3 mya and are called Australopithecus afarensis Australopithecus = \"southern ape\" afarensis = after the Afar depression, where the first fossils of

Evolutionary Record Dr. Bindon, ANT 101 Home SYNTHESIS OF DARWIN AND MENDEL &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution&quot;--Theodosius Dobzhansky &quot;The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all&quot;--Sir Peter Medawar Biological Species Concept Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1963) Defines species in terms of the gene pool, isolated from other similar gene pools Paleospecies A paleospecies or chronospecies is a morphologically or anatomically defined fossil species Since interbreeding cannot be determined for fossil species, species boundaries are determined by similarity of form The more difference there is between two fossil critters, the more likely they are members of separate species In a long-lived lineage with continuous fossil representation, an arbitrary species line will be drawn when &quot;enough&quot; difference is seen Speciation The process by which new species are produced from earlier ones This is the central process of macroevolution, or evolution at the level of the species or above (genus, family, etc.) Microevolution involves evolutionary change at the level of the population, and is defined by changes in allele frequencies within the population The Origin of Species Speciation occurs when populations of a species become reproductively isolated so that they can no longer interbreed with full fertility Geographic isolation of populations usually initiates the process Separated by a river, desert, volcano, etc. Selection operates to produce isolating mechanisms of anatomy and behavior Modes of Evolution Cladogenesis is branching evolution, the production of two or more daughter species from a single ancestral species Anagenesis is linear evolution, the production of a single daughter species from a single ancestral species Tempo of Evolution Gradualism views evolutionary change as occurring at a slow, steady, incremental rate over time Punctuated Equilibrium views the tempo of evolution as consisting of long periods of stability (equilibrium), followed by relatively short periods of rapid evolutionary change (punctuations) The Evolutionary Record The Cosmos Big bang estimated to have occurred between 12 - 15 billion years ago Milky way galaxy formed approximately
