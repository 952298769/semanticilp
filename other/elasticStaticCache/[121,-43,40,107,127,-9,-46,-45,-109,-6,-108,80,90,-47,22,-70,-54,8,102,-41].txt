Intraspecific competition--competition within the species b. Interspecific competition--can have an effect at any time but does increase as the population grows 1) competitive exclusion (one population goes extinct) 2) idea of the niche (set of resources that each species uses) 3) character displacement (evolutionary change in response to competition) c. Predation--also can have an effect at any time but may increase as the prey population grows 1) studies conflict on whether predation regulates prey population size 2) Avoiding predation a) avoid detection with camouflage, break-up shape to reduce identification b) advertise unpalatability with bright, contrasting colors c) mimic an unpalatable species (i.e., viceroys mimic monarch butterflies) d) advertise health so that predator avoids you & \nnbsp;",1.300215244293213],["Does he believe that predation or competition have any influence on population dynamics?",1.2991617918014526],["The increase of population, and the increase of food will generally be the effect, but not the necessary effect of high wages.",1.298852562904358],["The increase of population, and the increase of food will generally be the effect, but not the necessary effect of high wages.",1.298852562904358],["The increase of population, and the increase of food will generally be the effect, but not the necessary effect of high wages.",1.298852562904358],["The increase of population, and the increase of food will generally be the effect, but not the necessary effect of high wages.",1.298852562904358],["Mammalian predators did not have a substantial effect on population density.",1.2980644702911377],["Discuss the effect that predation can have on the size of the prey population and on the diversity of the community.",1.2980644702911377],["e.g., large predators have a major effect on populations of many other species.",1.2980644702911377],["But in undisturbed circumstances, the activities of the predators can have a strengthening effect on the population as a whole.",1.2980644702911377],["But it does not follow that predation is necessarily a factor determining average population levels, nor that generalized predator control is an effective form of management.",1.2893989086151123],["Teachers can demonstrate to students the effect small changes in food webs have on the entire ecosystem, not just the predators and prey of the organism whose population changes.",1.2889831066131592],["Although women who have inherited a germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene have an increased risk of developing breast cancer over that of the general population, actual disease occurrence varies greatly among women with the BRCA1 mutation.",1.286281704902649],["This might have the effect of increasing the Jewish population without increasing the general population.",1.2845685482025146],["According to this notion, in preindustrial societies there is a rough balance between births and deaths, because population increase is kept in check by a lack of available food, and by disease or war.",1.2827954292297363],["In some cases the organism persists and may become dominant due to a lack of natural population controls such as predators and diseases.",1.282134771347046],["Invasive species often lack natural predators and diseases which control populations in their native environments.",1.282134771347046],["Invasive species often lack natural predators and diseases which control populations in their native environments.",1.282134771347046],["October 6, 1999 Web posted at: 1:29 p.m. EDT (1729 GMT) It's the amount &#151; or lack of &#151; food, not increased predators that is limiting moose populations in the Yellowstone area, says a University of Nevada researcher.",1.2792364358901978]]
