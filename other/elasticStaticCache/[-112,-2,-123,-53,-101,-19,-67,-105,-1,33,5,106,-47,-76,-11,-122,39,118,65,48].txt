watts Rate of energy capture by plants from the sun = net primary productivity (NPP) = 100 terrawatts Only ~ 0.06% of sunlight is captured Captured in chemical bonds, especially in sugar Small amounts of energy are available to specialized microorganisms from chemical reactions not linked to sunlight It is estimated that 99% of the energy used by living cells comes from the sun Incorporation of

their own macromolecules and do not require products from other living creatures for life Other types of organisms, including ourselves, are heterotrophs: require products from other species for energy and materials An Overview of Photosynthesis In photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water are combined, using energy from sunlight, to form glucose Oxygen is given off as a waste product This is the source of the oxygen in the atmosphere Photosynthesis has 2 sets of reactions: Light reactions split water Hydrogens are used to produce a reduced coenzyme, NADPH, and ATP Oxygen is given off Once the NADPH and ATP are formed the rest of the reactions can take place in the dark CO2 is reduced to glucose A set of cyclic reactions: the Calvin cycle Blue Light Has More Energy than Red Light Light
