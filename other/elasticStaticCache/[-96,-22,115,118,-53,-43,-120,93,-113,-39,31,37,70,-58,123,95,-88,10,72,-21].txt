Most human characteristics are polygenic, which means they are controlled by many genes . Eye color, for example, is controlled by at least three genes and there may be more. Many human traits are also complex characters, which means the environment plays a role in the phenotype. Skin color, for example, can be influenced not only by several genes , but by the amount of sunlight a person’s skin receives. Some traits are incompletely dominant. This means that in heterozygous individuals, the phenotype is somewhere in between the phenotypes of the homozygous individuals. For example, if a curly haired Caucasian and a straight hair Caucasian have children, the child will have wavy hair. Some traits are controlled by multiple alleles, such as the ABO blood types in humans. The three alleles for blood typing are A (IA), B (IB), and O (i). The IA and IB alleles are also codominant, which means that if a person has both alleles, they are both expressed as the phenotype and that person would have AB blood. The type O (i) allele is recessive to A (IA) and B (IB) allele. In order to have type O blood, an individual must inherit a recessive allele (i) from each parent. If an individual inherits an A allele (IA) from one parent and an O allele (i) from another parent, then the individual will have type A blood (IA i) because the A allele is dominant to the O allele.",1.958283543586731],["She was one of the six children of the King and Queen that had red hair, a trait inherited from Anne of Brittany, Claude's mother.",1.9557838439941406],["Hair loss is an inherited trait.",1.9287657737731934],["Color and striping is controlled by gene groups that are inherited from the parent's genes, the same as hair color in humans.
