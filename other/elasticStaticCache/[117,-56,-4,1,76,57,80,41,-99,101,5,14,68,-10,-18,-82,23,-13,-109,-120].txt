Human Biology &gt; Human organ systems Humans have nine major organ systems which make the seven life processes: 1) The Digestive System Digestion breaks down food into simpler substances so it can be used and absorbed into the body It takes place in the alimentary canal, (food tube), mainly in the stomach and small intestine Digested food is absorbed into the blood system 2) The Respiratory System This is for taking in oxygen and removing waste carbon dioxide Air enters the lungs by movement of the rib muscles and diaphragm Oxygen is absorbed into the blood system 3) The Excretory System This removes toxic and other waste materials from the body.",1.30469810962677],["The brain and nerve cells are kept supplied with fresh oxygenated blood and drained of de-oxygenated blood through their arteries and veins which connect outside the cylinder to the artificial heart-lung digestive system - an elaborate, automatic contrivance.",1.243898868560791],["Digestive system Excretory system removes waste and toxic substances from blood.",1.2108726501464844],["Digestion directs blood to your digestive system and away from your heart.",1.1339476108551025],["Digestion directs blood to your digestive system and away from your heart.",1.1339476108551025],["released into small intestines Bile breaks down fat into tiny globules Pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into small intestines Circulatory System Terrestrial animals expend more energy than aquatic animals Counteracting the pull of gravity and greater oxygen demands -&gt;
