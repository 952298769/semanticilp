The electromagnetic forces within each surfaces resist the relative lateral motion of objects, in this case, it is the ball and grass. However, friction can also happen when the ball is in the air.

The hotter something is, the more thermal energy it has.  So when we see the ball bounce back up almost to its original height, we know that it is always a little bit lower than it started because it has transformed some of that original potential energy to thermal energy.",1.9572975635528564],["In order for the ball velocity and spin to reverse direction it is necessary to have a high coefficient of friction between ball and surface.
