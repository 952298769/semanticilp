OBJECTIVES The student will: *observe physical properties *describe objects in terms of the materials from which they are made *compare and contrast *make accurate observations using appropriate tools and units of measure *ask questions and propose strategies and materials to use in seeking answers to questions *use results in purposeful way, which includes making predictions based on patterns they have observed *examine strengths and weaknesses of simple arguments *make observations *participate in brainstorming activities *use various forms of simple logic *discover relationships and patterns *describe and compare things in terms of number, shpae, texture, size, weight, color and behavior *read and write instructions to be followed or instrctions which explain procedures *ask clarifying questions *explain problem-solving processes using verbal, pictorial and written methods *make and read simple graphs Find a Site | Create a Site | Edit a Site | Best Sites Showcase | Products &amp; Services Rights | PRIVACY | Terms of Use &copy; 2000, 2001 The Learning Network Inc.",1.3235160112380981],["Having a Bubble Blast - Students in grades 3-6 participate in an internet based collaborative project in which they devise a method to measure the size of a bubble blown from bubble gum and find the brand of gum that makes the largest bubble.",1.3208670616149902],["There are lots of things around you which can be used to make bubbles.",1.3206191062927246],["On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.",1.319902777671814],["Slug flow is a liquid–gas two-phase flow in which the gas phase exists as large bubbles separated by liquid \"slugs\".",1.319902777671814],["An antibubble is a droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a liquid.",1.319902777671814],["As a result, the neighboring liquid is set in motion toward the cooler side, which in turn propels the bubble or drop toward warmer liquid.",1.319902777671814],["With this technique, a known volume of air is actively pumped through an impinger, which contains a liquid medium, causing the liquid to bubble.",1.319902777671814],["Flooding, for bubbly flow of a vapor in a stagnant liquid, is the limit beyond which there will be a flow regime change and the liquid will no longer be stagnant.",1.319902777671814],["Bubble chambers rely on local evaporation of liquids like liquid nitrogen, which are temporarily kept at low pressure.",1.319902777671814],["There is no &quot;up&quot; so the bubbles happily stay put and eventually make a really strange liquid that can best be described as &quot;thin&quot;.",1.3109958171844482],["As a liquid, nitrogen can be used to shrink balloons, bend metal, run a steam engine, pop corks, make bubbles, and teach your students how molecules move.",1.310865044593811],["In order to demonstrate chemical concepts, students may use liquid nitrogen to cook up a vat of ice cream or watch Kelter make &quot;elephant toothpaste,&quot; a chemical reaction that produces mounds of bubbles.",1.310865044593811]]
