Few people are familiar with this species. They typically spend summer days hidden in the foliage of deciduous trees. The number of young ranges from 1 to 4, averaging 2.3. These bats often chase insects that are attracted to lights, such as street lamps. It is this behavior that most likely brings them in close proximity to people. L. borealis is well-adapted for surviving drastic temperature fluctuations; it does not hibernate in caves, but apparently in trees. Some migrate long distances.
