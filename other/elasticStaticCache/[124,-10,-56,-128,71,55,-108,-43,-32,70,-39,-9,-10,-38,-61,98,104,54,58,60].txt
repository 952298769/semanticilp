Producers, such as plants and algae, get their energy directly from sunlight, and get the materials they need from air and water. Consumers get their energy and materials by eating other organisms. Ecologists classify consumers based on what kinds of organisms they eat: herbivores eat producers; carnivores eat other animals; omnivores eat both producers and animals; decomposers get their energy and materials from droppings and dead organisms. When a consumer eats another organism, it never gets all of the energy that organism has taken in. Some of the energy has already been used by the organism being eaten and some is left in body parts that can’t be eaten. For this reason, there is less and less energy available as you move up in an ecosystem from producers, to herbivores, to omnivores and carnivores.
