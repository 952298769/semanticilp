Moon Have you ever walked along the beach And heard the ocean whisper at night Have you ever been alone in dusky woods And witnessed an owl take flight Have you ever walked out in evening snow And

Sunrise Sunset The bright and magnificent sun rose early today He helped trees grow Melted bitter snow Tomorrow he will rise in another ceremonious play The sun went down furiously in a stunning sunset With purples and blues Then moon appeared new The dark, light-spotted horizon he angrily met by Andrew Carden Autumn A placid wind blows through the tired trees Splashes of brilliant red paint the leaves Pairs of Juncos bounce around on the ground Chirping contently at seeds they ve found Hints of winter s chill are felt in the air Autumn s first frost catches farmers unaware Like misting rain the leaves begin to fall How magnificent is the splendor of it all What is the purpose for the grandeur of fall To praise the Creator with its glorious all by Andrew Carden An Astronomical Question A black moon Mostly All but a razor thin strip Looks down on Me Are the stars There For the moon or is it There for Them by Andrew Carden Orion The crescent moon Poised like a battle axe Stabs horizonward Chasing the sun Leaving in it s wake A sea full of stars The night sky Crowded with ancient souls Watches the dance of Luminous figures Bemused by their Divergent magnitude by Andrew Carden Rain Sleep s Song Hear the rain Rattling and tapping Knocking on the window pane Crashing down Echoing in gutters Pelting the soaking ground It beads up When enough drops They race toward the outcrop Not straightly But in a random Zag zig motion like a tributary Mortal mist It grays the sky Clouds cover us like a quilt Wet shroud Blankets us with A comforting monotonous sound by Andrew

Andrew Carden The Field Out beneath the open sky Is a field that s down the way So quiet when a wind blows by Rustling grass echoes for days In that field I often sit Thinking my thoughts all alone If

of security With age-old precision he rises each day Never \ncomplaining, lighting the earth With a pleasant unwavering smile Like new fallen snow enticing me to play Her radiance draws me out into the night As her beams dance with the shadows Even the stars take note of the bedazzling light Each night she changes, ever so slightly Entertaining and pleasing with her countless forms With each new mask a drama unfolds by Andrew Carden The Tree In the heart of a country field Stands a solitary tree With no one to share it s secrets With except for maybe me During the winter s icy months Bough
