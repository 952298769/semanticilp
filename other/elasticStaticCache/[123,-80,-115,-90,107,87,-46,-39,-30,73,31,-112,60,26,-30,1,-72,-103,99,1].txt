The large native South African plants reach more than 20 feet in height. All plants in this genus grow fleshy leaves and produce clusters of blossoms on individual stems. In cooler climates, plant large aloes in full sunlight, but in arid climates, plant them in light shade. These plants require little water and quick-draining soil to survive.

Temperatures below 30°F (-1°C) in the spring will damage new leaves, fruit, and tender shoots. In November, temperatures below 27°F (-2.5°C) may cause trunk damage to young vines and will freeze leaves. After 2-4 nights of freezing temperatures (with or without frost protection), vines usually tolerate temperatures in the mid-to-low 20's F (-4° to -5°C). Cold sites, generally, are not satisfactory for kiwifruit vines, although some growers are able to grow vines in these area but often take plant losses due to the cold.

Growth of the plant begins to slow down at about 80° F and stop entirely when the temperature reaches 100° F. High temperatures and bright sunlight will also scorch leaves and fruit, although bananas grow best in full sun. Freezing temperatures will kill the foliage. In most areas bananas require wind protection for best appearance and maximum yield. They are also susceptible to being blown over.
