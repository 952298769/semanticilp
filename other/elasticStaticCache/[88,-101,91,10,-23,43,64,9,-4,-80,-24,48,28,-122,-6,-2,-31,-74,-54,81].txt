modern chimps do see the description of chimp toolmaking on page 339 chimps strip twigs off sticks, lick them, and poke them into termite hills, ant hills, and bees nests to get insects out to eat they use a flat rock and a hammerstone to break hard nuts they wad up leaves and use them like sponges to get water out of crevices in trees etc. we would not detect this kind of toolmaking if A. afarensis had done it such toolmaking would be expected, since otherwise it would have to have evolved twice, separately in the chimp line and the hominids Comparison to Kenyanthropus platyops Body size similar to A. afarensis Can't tell yet about sexual dimorphism Diet probably different from A. afarensis Jaw and teeth similarly reduced No canines known yet But molars are small, not like the huge molars of A. afarensis So probably vegetarian, maybe frugivorous, but probably without the specializations for eating a lot of hard nuts and seeds that developed in A. afarensis No stone tools from this period by any species, but maybe perishable ones Implications of the new species Kenyanthropus platyops it is quite different from A afarensis in numerous face, cranial, and dental traits so the lineage that led to Kenyanthropus probably split from the one that led to A. afarensis well before 3.5 mya we used to think there was a single line of early bipedal apes, represented by A. afarensis but now it is clear that there were at least two lineages of bipedal apes evolving at the same time with different diets, and probably other differences we one can be our ancestor and since

Biological Anthropology: Class 14 The first hominids &#227; Copyright Bruce Owen 2001 Last time we saw how apes radiated (diversified) in the middle Miocene and that many of those ape varieties went extinct in the Late Miocene while the monkey lineages flourished and diversified This may have had to do with environmental changes the temperature was dropping rapidly tropical forests were shrinking leaving more open, grassland environments with groves of trees and temperate forests most of the apes are thought to have been forest dwellers remember that their long arms and grasping hands and feet seem to be arboreal adaptations so their territories may have shrunk and changed to the point that many of the arboreal apes could not survive around the end of the Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene, about 5 mya, one of the surviving kinds of apes responded to this stress in a completely new way: it became habitually bipedal the adaptations for arboreal life that arose among the Miocene hominoids incidentally also allowed for limited bipedalism on the ground much as gorillas, chimps, and gibbons can walk bipedally at times it is not hard to imagine that as trees got farther apart and there were more open spaces, natural selection might have favored apes that were better at bipedal walking this was the split that led to hominids important point: the first thing that really distinguished our lineage from all other primates was bipedalism not large brains, capable hands, or anything else that we know of unfortunately, we have very few fossils from the late Miocene, so we don't know much about which lineage of Miocene apes became bipedal or exactly what stages they went through to get there but we do know from DNA evidence that the lineage that led to the bipedal apes diverged from the lineages that led to chimps, bonobos, and gorillas around 7 to 5 mya that is, we and the other pongids (great apes) all stem from a common ancestral kind of ape that lived at the end of the Miocene, around 5 to 7 mya we also can be pretty sure that this transition to bipedalism happened in Africa there were Miocene apes in both Africa and tropical Asia but all of the remains of habitually bipedal apes prior to our own genus ( Homo ) have been found in Africa Specifically, in East and South Africa The bipedal apes are called hominids other than their form of locomotion, they weren't very different from other apes characteristics that set hominids (us and our closest relatives) apart from other apes habitual bipeds different jaws and teeth generally reduced size and strength of jaws small canines short, wide, &quot;parabolic&quot; dental arcade (shape of the whole row of teeth) some, but not all, had large molars in comparison to other teeth thick enamel on the molars this is a feature that had already appeared among some, but not all, Miocene apes slightly larger brain relative to body size the earliest hominids did not have all of these traits specifically, they didn't have the larger brains until later and the sides of the dental arcade were still pretty straight and almost parallel but since they are clearly separate from the other apes, and evolving in the direction of humans, we count these early bipeds in with the hominids The earliest hominids of which we have fossils are at least two species that date from around 4.4 mya to 3.9 mya still poorly known, based on teeth and a few larger fragments Ardipithecus ramidus (around 4.4 mya) mostly known from fairly apelike teeth molars are typical in size for apes enamel on molars is thin, as is typical for apes but the canines are relatively smaller than among other apes but the location of the foramen magnum is more forward than in other apes, hinting at habitual upright posture - and thus bipedalism recall that the foramen magnum is the hole in the base of the cranium through which the spinal cord connects to the brain but tends to be forward and underneath the head in \nupright animals that balance the head on top of the spinal column either due to bipedal walking or upright sitting or clinging in trees apparently lived in wooded areas based on seeds found with fossils and other animals including a kind of antelope that would have lived in temperate forest and colobine monkeys, which are now mostly forest dwellers Australopithecus anamensis (around 4.2 to 3.9 mya) mostly teeth, but some cranial, mandible, and limb fragments upper and lower jaws and teeth were quite similar to apes relatively U-shaped dental arcade receding chin but with some more hominid-like features reduced canines relatively enlarged molars thick enamel on the molars, indicating selection for grinding hard seeds knee joint suggests bipedalism and elbow joint is like ours, rather than like apes that use arms for support on the ground ape elbows lock in a straight position human elbows do not and neither did anamensis 's elbow so it probably did not lean on its arms much another indication of bipedalism so far, it seems reasonable to consider Ardipithecus ramidus an early member of the lineage that split from our common ancestor with chimps and Australopithecus anamensis as a likely descendant of Ardipithecus ramidus The earliest bipeds that we have relatively good evidence of so far date from roughly 4 mya to 3 mya and are called Australopithecus afarensis
