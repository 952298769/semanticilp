More details This question is a very general one and there are several different answers which are all valid. For example, the metal 'copper' is a conductor; a person who directs an orchestra is called is a conductor; a conductor is someone who works aboard a bus or train! The physics meaning of a conductor is a substance, body, or device that readily conducts heat, electricity, sound, etc. E.g. copper is a very good conductor of electricity and heat. An electrical conductor is a substance that permits electrons to flow through it easily. Most metals are good conductors. In contrast, insulators are strongly resistant to any flow of electrons. Semiconductors can be controlled in their conductivity, and are thus very useful in electronics. A thermal conductor is a substance that permits the flow of heat. Interestingly, most electrical conductors are also good thermal conductors, since the electrons can also distribute the heat rapidly. However, there are also some good thermal conductors (such as diamond) that are good electrical insulators. A conductor of light is a substance that permits the flow of light. Interestingly, most conductors of light are not good conductors of electricity - they are insulators - but may or may not also be good thermal insulators. For instance diamond is a good conductor of light, is a conductor of heat but is still a good electrical insulator. A conductor is something that allows electricity, heat or light to flow through it.
