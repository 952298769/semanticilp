plan, conduct, and participate in science investigations develop questions to form a hypothesis (use if/then statements) chart and graph data make inferences and draw conclusions sequence natural events chronologically measure length to the nearest centimeter, mass to the nearest gram, volume to the nearest milliliter or liter, temperature to the nearest degree Celsius, and time to the nearest minute Earth and Space Science Students: investigate and understand the major components of soil, its origin, and its importance to plants and animals, including humans understand that rock, clay, silt, sand, and humus are components of soil understand that soil is a natural resource that should be conserved understand that soil provides support and nutrients for plants investigate and understand basic sequences/cycles occurring in nature describe basic natural cycles such as day and night, seasonal changes, phases of the moon (new moon to full moon), and tides (high and low) describe plant and animal life cycles Students: investigate and understand different sources of energy explain how the sun is the Earth s source of light and heat energy describe and define resources as renewable (wood and water) and nonrenewable (fossil fuels--- coal, oil, and natural gas) describe natural forms of energy--sunlight, falling water, and wind understand that renewable and nonrenewable resources are used to generate electricity Life Science Students: investigate and understand relationships among organisms in aquatic and terrestrial food chains investigate and understand that behavioral and physical adaptations allow animals to respond to life needs define the terms hibernation, migration, camouflage, and mimicry, and understand the difference between instinct and learned behavior describe how animals gather food, find shelter, defend themselves, and rear young investigate the characteristics of butterflies, observe and illustrate their life cycle, and understand the relationship between the butterfly and its environment Physical Science Students: investigate and understand that objects are described in terms of the materials they are made of and their physical properties understand that objects are made of smaller parts and that materials are composed of parts too small to be seen without magnification understand that physical properties remain the same even if the material is reduced in size Students: investigate and demonstrate an understanding of the uses of chemical and physical properties identify physical and chemical properties of five powders perform simple chemical tests to identify powders identify unknown substances by comparing observations of their characteristics with properties of known powders record observations of experiments in chart form Students: investigate and demonstrate an understanding of the uses for linear, mass, volume, and temperature metric units use nonstandard units such as hands, feet, and paper clips to measure length use nonstandard units such as water and colored solutions to measure volume use nonstandard units such as paper clips and marbles to measure mass estimate and measure length in centimeters, meters, and kilometers identify real-world applications for metric measurement **During the school year, students will review the kindergarten through second grade science SOLs in
