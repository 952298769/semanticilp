Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a
