the susceptibility of igneous rocks reflects the order of crystallization given in BRS: 1) rate of weathering corresponds to the minerals position on the BRS (olivine - first and quartz - last) 2) rocks are aggregates of minerals, rocks with minerals higher in the BRS weather first 4 Page 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS TYPES OF WEATHERING 1) Mechanical or Physical weathering - disintegration or fragmentation of rocks involving no change in the mineralogical composition of the rocks 2) Chemical Weathering - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals 5 Page 6 WEATHERING AND SOILS WEATHERING PROCESSES Mechanical Weathering - breaks rock into smaller fragments that retain the characteristics of the original rock - do not change the mineralogical composition of the rock - exposes more surface area (increases the surface area to volume ratio) of rock for subsequent chemical attack 6 Page 7 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) FROST ACTION - Frost wedging, Frost Heaving , Salt Wedging 2) UNLOADING - Sheeting 3) THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION 4) ABRASION 5) ORGANIC (BIOLOGICAL) ACTIVITY 7 Page 8 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging - Frost wedging results from alternate freezing and thawing of water in cracks within rocks - as water freezes, volume increases by 9% -expansion exerts a force that is great enough to break the rocks 8 Page 9 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Requirements 1) pre-existing cracks or voids in rocks 2) adequate moisture (water) 3) temperature rises and falls below the freezing point of water - common in temperate climates, and high mountains in tropical regions 9 Page 10 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION -

a layer of loose rock or soil is lifted by the expansion of freezing water e.g. lifting of highway pavement during winter 11 Page 12 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES Salt Wedging - the growth and expansion of salt crystals induce stresses that break rocks, common in coastal areas and deserts Requirements 1) existing cracks 2) salt water supply 3) warm temperature for salt crystallization 12 Page 13 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) UNLOADING Sheeting - rock expands as overburden is removed by erosion, the overlying pressure diminishes (pressure release mechanical weathering ) - the increase in volume accommodated by the development of cracks and fractures parallel to the ground surface - common in plutons 13 Page 14 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) UNLOADING Exfoliation - large concentric plates or shells split from the main rock mass like the layers of an onion -

particles are dragged along in the overland flow but not suspended because the flow is thin and laminar overland flow movement of water over slopes when precipitation intensity exceeds the soil infiltration capacity according to soil porosity and permeability, vegetation, slope gradient, antecedent moisture and seasonal factors (e.g. ice) rill erosion overland flow deepens downslope, reaching a critical depth where laminar flow cannot be maintain and turbulence begins to develop shallow ephemeral channels called rills form where soil has been eroded from the slope because water flows directly down slopes (doesn't meander like streams), rills tend to straight and extend only to the base of the slope gullying the erosion of deep narrow channels, commonly by piping, the formation of natural tunnels by underground water erosion, and and sapping, when the roof of a tunnel collapses whereas rills are confined to slopes, gullies are part of the drainage network, that is, they shed and water and sediment form slopes and into higher order streams Mass wasting the downslope movement of earth materials in response to gravitational stress , where stress is force over area (kg m -2 ) shear stress the component of gravitational stress that is parallel to the slope and causes earth materials to move downslope normal stress the component of gravitational stress that is directed into (perpendicular to) the slope, and gives earth materials strength and resistance to erosion and mass wasting shear strength the resistance to shear stress as a function of the normal stress , cohesion, inter-particle friction, and porewater pressure factors that cause increased shear stress and potential for mass wasting undercutting of slopes: increases the slope angle loading of slopes ( e.g. water, snow or sediment): increases the weight of earth materials earthquakes or man-made vibrations: transient and instantaneous increase in stress regional tilting: increases slope angles over large areas factors that cause decreased shear strength excess soil moisture (porewater pressure): forces particles apart and thereby reduces friction weathering: reduces cohesion among grains and crystals inherent weakness: poorly consolidated soil and rock structural changes: progressive changes to soil and rock structure ( e.g ., the breaking apart of soil aggregates) types of mass wasting creep the slow imperceptible plastic deformation of soil and weak it is caused by the expansion and contraction of soil in response to wetting and drying or freeze and thawing, thus creep tends to be seasonal the soil expands away from the surface, but during the contraction phase it moves slightly downslope in response to gravity (shear stress) creep is common on grassland slopes where there are no tree roots to bind the soil together with a low sun angle, early or late in the day, terracettes (small terraces) are visible on prairie hillsides flow the internal shearing (fluid
