process in which pollen is transferred from the male part of one flower to the female part of another flower cuticle (KYOOT-lh-kuhl): waxy covering of the epidermis that prevents the loss of too much water from a leaf cytoplasm : all the protoplasm, or living material, outside the nucleus of a cell Top of page D data: recorded observations and measurements deciduous forest : forest biome that contains deciduous trees, which shed their leaves in the autumn decomposer: organism that feeds on dead organic matter and breaks it down into simpler substances dendrite: fiber that carries messages from a neuron toward the cell body density: measure of how much mass is contained in volume of an object depletion: process in which nutrients are washed away from the soil by water depressant: drug that slows down the actions of the nervous system dermis : inner layer of the skin desert : biome that receives less than 25 centimeters of rainfall a year diaphragm (DIGH-uh-fram): muscle at the bottom of the chest that aids in breathing diatom (DIGH-uti-tahm): type of golden algae that is made of a tough grasslike material diffusion : process by which food molecules, oxygen, water, and other materials enter and leave a cell through the cell membrane digest: break down digestion: process by which food is broken down into simpler substances digestive system : body system in which food is broken down into simpler substances for use by the body dinoflagellate (digh-nuh-FI,A,J-uh-liht): type of fire algae that has two flagella division of labor : division of the work among the different parts of an organism's body that keeps an organism alive DNA (deoxyribonticleic acid): nucleic acid that stores the information needed to build proteins and carries genetic information about an organism dominant: stronger trait in genetics Top of page E esophagus (ill-SAliF-uh-guhs): pipe-shaped tube that transports food to the stomach estrogen : hormone that triggers the broadening of the lilps in females and starts the maturation of egg cells in the ovaries evaporation : process in which radiant heat from thesun turns liquid water into a gas evolution : change in a species over time excretion: process of getting rid of waste materials excretory (EHKS-kruh-tor-ce) system: body system that removes body wastes exhale: breathe out exocrine (EHK-suh-ki-iiiii) gland: gland that releases its chemicals through ducts, or tubes, into a nearby organ exoskeleton : rigid, outer covering of an organism external fertilization : fertilization that occurs outside the body of the female
