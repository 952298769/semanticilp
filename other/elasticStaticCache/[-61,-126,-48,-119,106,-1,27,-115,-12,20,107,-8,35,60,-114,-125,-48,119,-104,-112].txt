Law efficiencies depend on how well the energy source is matched to the need... for example if steam is needed to run a turbine, then heating the water beyond 100 C (steam) results in lost efficiency Most energy needs are low temperature: We get most of our energy from heat engines , which convert heat energy to other, more useable, forms of energy... such as motion (car)... or electricity ...
