structure, H2O fig 2.12 Water Acts Like a Magnet Electronegativity attracts electrons of water molecules Has distinct ends, each with a partial charge Polar molecule results from magnet like poles Polarity is crux of chemistry of water and life Charge separation results in polar nature Most stable configuration is tetrahedron, bond angle 104.5% Partial (d+) charges at apexes opposite hydrogens Partial (d-) charge at oxygen Polar molecules interact with one another Opposite charges attract, form hydrogen bonds fig 2.13 Bonds are transient, cumulative effects important Hydrogen bonds affect

with OH- groups of sucrose Each sugar molecule surrounded by cloud of water molecules Cloud is called the hydration shell Hydration shells form around ions fig 2.17 Water Organizes Nonpolar Molecules Water excludes nonpolar molecules Preferentially forms hydrogen bonds with itself Minimizes disruption of hydrogen bonding Hydrophobic: not soluble in water, nonpolar Hydrophilic: soluble in water, polar Hydrophobic exclusion Forces nonpolar molecules to associate together Shapes molecules with nonpolar regions Water Ionizes Ionization is spontaneous formation of ions Results from breaking of
