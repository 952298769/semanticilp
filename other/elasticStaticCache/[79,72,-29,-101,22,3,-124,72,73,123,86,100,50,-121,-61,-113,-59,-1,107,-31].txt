[["funguslike is the answer and heres some facts about it Neither _ plants nor animals, the fungi kingdom includes toadstools, _ puffballs, and MOLDS. Fungi feed on living or deaâ€¦d organisms by _ making them rot. Fungi are visible only when spore-bearing fruiting _ bodies form. _ _ _ _ HOW DO FUNGI FEED? _ _ Fungi absorb nutrients from plant or _ animal matter around them, which may be living or dead. They _ produce long, slender threads called hyphae that spread through _ their food. The hyphae release enzymes that break down the food _ into substances that the fungi can easily absorb. _ _ _ _ _ HOW DO FUNGI REPRODUCE? _ _ Most fungi reproduce by releasing _ tiny spores that then germinate (sprout) and grow into a new _ fungus. The spores are produced by, and released from, a fruiting _ body that is visible above the ground. Some fungi drop spores, _ which are blown away by the wind. Others shoot them out in an _ explosive burst. _ _ _ _ _ ARE MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS THE SAME? _ _ _ Toadstools are brightly colored and poisonous to eat, but mushrooms _ are usually edible and dull in color. Both toadstools and mushrooms _ are fruiting bodies (spore-bearing structures) produced by fungi. _ They belong to the same group, the Basidiomycetes, so scientists _ make no distinction between the two.",1.3634604215621948],["The plants, when germinated showed exactly the same changes.",1.2906471490859985],["The plants, when germinated showed exactly the same changes.",1.2906471490859985],["The plants, when germinated showed exactly the same changes.",1.2906471490859985],["The plants, when germinated showed exactly the same changes.",1.2906471490859985]]
