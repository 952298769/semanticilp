from extremely bright, hot stars in upper left-hand corner to faint, cool stars in lower right-hand corner Region is called main sequence since it contains most of stars that could be plotted Sun is G2 main-sequence star Lies roughly in middle of diagram among what are referred to as yellow dwarfs Temperatures for main-sequence stars varies from Approximately 3000 o K for M stars to Approximately 50,000 o K for O stars Main-sequence stars are all members of one luminosity class, luminosity class V However, they vary from extremely luminous O stars to very faint M dwarfs Range of about a billion in luminosity Because of their number and common internal structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up main sequence Common type of star in our Galaxy is faint, cool, M-type star, Known as red dwarf Presumably also true for other galaxies, but too faint to prove Mass-Luminosity Relation for Main-Sequence Stars From orbital motion of binary stars, astronomers able to estimate masses of component stars in binary system Observed that masses of main-sequence stars increases from spectral class M up main sequence to spectral class O Mass-luminosity relation - plot of mass against luminosity (where possible) Luminosity of main-sequence stars proportional to approximately fourth power of mass Mathematical form: L a M 4 Other Properties of Main-Sequence Stars Radii of stars on main sequence increases from small radii M dwarfs to large radii O stars Luminosity, temperature, radius, and mass for main sequence stars increases from M to O stars Fundamental property upon which other three depend is mass of gas composing main-sequence stars Red Giants Red giants - second most prominent region in H-R diagram composed bright, cool stars Red giants are luminous stars in spectral classes F, G, K, and M lying above main sequence in region that angles up toward bright, cool stars in upper right-hand corner Despite being members of same luminosity class, red giants vary by at least a factor of 100 in luminosity 100 times more luminous than Sun on average Surface temperature varies 3000 o K to 7000 o K No relationship exists between mass and position on red giant branch No mass-luminosity relation has been found for red-giant stars Radii of giant stars does increase progressing upward toward upper right-hand corner of H-R diagram Blue and Red Supergiants Supergiants - are stars of luminosity classes I and II Blue supergiants - if early-type stars of classes O and B Red supergiants - if late-type stars in classes G, K, and M Blue and red supergiants can be hundreds of thousands of times more luminous than Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and red supergiants White Dwarfs White dwarfs - span spectral classes \nB, A, and F, and composed of faint stars lying below main sequence Note: when star referred to as being \"on\" or \"off main sequence,\" reference is to position in H-R diagram and not to its actual position in space White dwarfs appear to be second most populous region in H-R diagram Supergiants seen at great distance across Galaxy But white dwarfs more numerous only less visible at great distances White dwarfs are typically a few thousandths of luminosity of Sun Surface temperature greater than that of Sun White dwarf stars all possess Masses less than about 1.4 M sun Radii a few hundredths of Sun's (700,000 km) making them about size of Earth (7,000 km) Consequently, white dwarfs must have mean densities on order of millions of g/cm 3 Suggests white dwarfs composed of matter in state unlike anything we possess on Earth Bright Stars vs. Nearby Stars Stars that are among brightest in night sky are, in general, intrinsically brighter than Sun Most are giants or supergiants, about 70% Some are early-type stars on upper end of main sequence, about 30% Stars that are among closest to Solar System are, in general, intrinsically fainter than Sun - most telescopic Most are red dwarf stars, i.e., spectral class M stars Some are white dwarf stars Stars within about 15 ly of Solar System Number about 50 stars About 0.004 star/ly 3 Or, about 1.0 star/300 ly 3 For every 1000 small, red, class M stars, there are 350 class A to K main-sequence
