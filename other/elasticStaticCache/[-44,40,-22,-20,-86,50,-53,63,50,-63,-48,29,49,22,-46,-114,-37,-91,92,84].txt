of plant sexual reproduction It attracts insects needed to carry the pollen between plants to allow pollination It's really important for reproduction 2) Stem The stem is the organ which holds the leaves upright in the air and facing the light It carries water and minerals to the leaves, and food around the plant The stem is important for nutrition, excretion and growth 3) Leaves The leaves are the organs of photosynthesis They make all the food that the plant needs Leaves contain chlorophyll, which uses light energy to change carbon dioxide and water into glucose They have tiny little pores, which allow essential carbon dioxide in and waste gases out Leaves are important for nutrition and excretion 4) Roots The root is the organ which provides anchorage for the plant so that it does not blow away or fall over With its root hairs it provides a big surface area to help take in water and minerals from the soil - these are both essential for photosynthesis The root is therefore important for nutrition All parts will be sensitive to the surroundings.",1.7023444175720215],["Most of the photosynthesis occurs in the green stem branches.",1.6415369510650635],["Many of the members
