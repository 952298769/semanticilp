recrystallizes into glacial ice Equilibrium line--point of maximum flow, usually corresponds to snow line Zone of ablation--glacier melts and releases its sediment load Features left by Glaciation Erosional: cirques, horns, ar tes, U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, tarns, paternoster lakes, striations, fjords Depositional: till, moraines (lateral, medial, terminal, recessional, ground), drumlins, kames, eskers, kettle lakes, outwash plains, erratics, varves Icebergs--floating freshwater ice blocks calved from glaciers reaching the ocean Ice-marginal lakes--large lakes formed from ice dams or ice-weight depressions Pluvial lakes--large lakes that formed in glacial times but not close to glaciers Land bridges--continental connections that arise from a lowering of sea level Deserts and Eolian (Wind) processes Deserts--regions of dry climate due to falling air Exotic streams--rivers that arise in humid regions then flow across deserts Ephemeral streams--streams that only flow occasionally during flash floods Playa lakes--salty intermittent lakes that fill only during wet years or seasons Desertification--conversion of marginal land to desert by human activities Wind erosion--abrasion, deflation, blowouts, ventifacts, desert pavement Wind deposition--barchan dunes, transverse dunes, linear dunes, star dunes, parabolic dunes, loess Chapter 13: Waves and Coastal Currents Wave Characteristics Wave particle motion--circles in deep water, ellipses in shallow water Wave speed--longer waves travel faster, all waves slow down in shallow water Wave base--depth at which waves stop oscillating the water (half wavelength) Wave diffraction--waves spread out after passing through a narrow opening Wave refraction--waves bend when reaching shallow water at an angle Evolution of Ocean Waves Storms--generation of waves (wind energy converted to wave energy) Swell--free traveling waves (can travel thousands of miles without dissipation) Surf--the breaking of waves along a coast (geologic work by wave energy) Wave Action along Coasts Waves cut a platform and a cliff at sea level Waves transport beach sediment by longshore drift Waves refract to attack headlands and fill bays (making a straight coastline) Barrier islands form, shielding lagoons, in areas with large sediment volume Tsunamis (Seismic Sea Waves) Long and dangerous waves created by earthquakes or underwater landslides Can devastate coastal communities if they are not properly warned Ocean Tides (Gravity-induced waves) Bulges of water form toward and away from the earth &amp; move like giant waves The Moon/Sun interaction produces Spring Tides and Neap Tides The earth's tilt (declination) moves the bulges north and south of the equator Tidal bulges can't keep up with the earth's rotation (1000 MPH) because of their slow speed (450 MPH) and blocking by continents Ocean basins with a natural 12 or 24 hour resonance have high tidal ranges Large ocean basins have rotary tides (circle around a point) Chapter 14: Ocean Waters Ocean Water Origin and Composition Water--H 2 0, polar molecule causes surface tension and high heat capacity Water derived from volcanic volatiles and cometary collisions with Earth Ocean water well mixed, interacts with atmosphere, seafloor, and land Color blue or green because these wavelengths penetrate the deepest Dissolved gasses--more oxygen near surface, more carbon dioxide at depth Nutrients--depleted at surface (removed by organisms which then die &amp; sink) Salinity--typically about 35 , mostly chlorine (19.4 ) and sodium (10.8 ) Density--increases with decreasing temperature &amp; increasing salinity Thermocline--temperature profile caused by solar radiation and water density Thermocline creates the SOFAR channel which confines sound waves Surface (horizontal) Circulation (relatively fast) Driven by surface winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) Controlled by Coriolis Effect and continental barriers Gyres circulate clockwise in northern hemisphere, CCW in S. hemisphere Gulf Stream and similar currents are \"rivers in the ocean\" Eddies north of Gulf Stream Eddies south of Gulf Stream Spin clockwise Spin counterclockwise Warm water cores Cold water cores Stay at surface Sink deep Low in nutrients &amp; life High in nutrients &amp; life Deep (vertical) Circulation (very slow) Driven by differences in water density (due to temperature and salinity) Vertical circulation is often blocked by the thermocline Deep upwelling near poles, shallow upwelling along coasts and at equator Upwelled waters contain nutrients and have high biological productivity Mediterranean Sea water circulates horizontally due to its high salinity Chapter 15: Marine and Nearshore Environments Oceanic Zones Epicontinental Seas--shallow continental arms of the sea (i.e. Hudson Bay) Continental Shelves--shallow flooded edges of continents (i.e. North Sea) Shelf Break--edge of continent where shelf drops off toward deep ocean floor Continental Slope--steep incline, cut by numerous submarine canyons Continental Rise--area of deep-sea fans and turbidite \ndeposits from Slope Abyssal Plains--deep flat areas of the ocean floor covered with clays and oozes Trenches--deepest zones of the ocean, correspond to tectonic subduction zones Transgressions--rises in sea level that flood more of the continents Regressions--drops in sea level that expose formerly covered continental areas Coastal Zones of the United States (from north to south) Glacial Erosion--many fjords and islands with hard bedrock (coast of Maine) Glacial Deposition--peninsulas and islands made of glacial till (Cape Cod) Estuaries--drowned river valleys cut by glacial runoff (Chesapeake bay) Barrier islands &amp;
