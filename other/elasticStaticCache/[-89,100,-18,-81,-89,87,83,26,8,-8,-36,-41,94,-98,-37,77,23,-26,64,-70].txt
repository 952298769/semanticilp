they give off that heat by radiation by emitting light of different energies The temperature of the object determines the energy of the radiation that it gives off For regular temperatures (like body temperature), most of the energy is in the infrared part of the light spectrum When objects get very hot (like the sun) they give off visible light, which has more energy Electromagnetic waves A wave

wavelengths interacts with substances differently Absorption is the process where energy from light is transferred to electrons in atoms of the material The light doesn t come out the other side
