Carolus Linnaeus developed the idea of binomial nomenclature which is still used although not with the names he originally proposed Purposes of taxonomy provide an unambiguous identification for each organism provides a way of understanding the relationships among diverse species Methods of taxonomy comparative biology compares characteristics of organisms characteristics can be anatomical - presence of limbs, head, different organs, body cavity cellular - presence of types of cells or tissues, presence of organelles reproductive modes - lays egg, live birth molecular - presence of types of genes, sequences genes organisms are named and grouped based on defined sets of characteristics groups start small with organisms which are the only ones possessing a trait - species groups are then put together to form larger groups which have more characteristics in common - genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom - these groups are called taxa Phylogeny the evolutionary relationship among different taxa sort of a family tree early taxonomic schemes predated the concept of evolution and/or modern biochemical techniques used for comparisons this resulted in groupings of organisms which weren&#146;t correctly organized with respect to their evolutionary origins there is currently a lot of research into taxonomy and phylogeny using new molecular tools Characteristics used to construct phylogenies shared traits - synapomorphies traits which all members of a group under consideration share i.e. chordates - all have a notochord during sometime in their life cycle i.e. birds - all have feathers there are characteristics which are homologous between groups of organism homologous characteristics are those which share a common evolutionary origin limbs of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals homologous structures have very similar embryonic origins there are also similar characteristics which are not homologous structures i.e. wings in insects and wings in birds these are non-homologous structures although they perform the same function - flight since these structure perform the same task, flight, they are referred to as orthologous structures derived characteristics those characteristics which are only present in the group of animals being studied ancestral characteristics those present both in the group being studied and in other groups the idea is that ancestral characters would be those found in direct ancestors of the group under consideration a derived character for one group can be an ancestral character for another, more advanced group the arrangement of groups based on synapomorphy of derived characters is hierarchical How do we 1 st determine what characteristics should be used to then determine phylogeny traits determined by methods already described chief among these is molecular biology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology molecular biology sequences of rRNA and mitochondrial DNA comparative embryology - recapitulation to understand how adult structures arise and their potential relationships as homologous structures modern developmental biologist have found that the same genes are used to govern the embryogenesis of all vertebrates and even many invertebrates comparative anatomy study of body plans of animals Phylogenic divisions of life Two broadest divisions prokaryotes - single celled
