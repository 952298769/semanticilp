tissue synthesis, osmoregulation, digestion, respiration, reproduction, locomotion, etc. Introduction The original energy source for food energy is the sun energy from the sun is converted by photosynthesis into the production of glucose glucose is the hydrocarbon source from which plants synthesize other organic compounds such as COH, protein, lipids as previously mentioned, one must consider the quality of these sources Introduction Most animals obtain energy from food or body reserves/stores (glycogen, lipid) energy is stored in chemical bonds holding nutrient molecules together some bonds have more energy associated with them than others when you have many nutrients comprising a feed, the energy level of that feed can vary substantially availability of energy varies based upon feed ingredient and species growth is the endpoint of net energy Glycogen Molecule Lipid Molecule Introduction Energy goes through many cycles and transformations, always with loss of heat can be released at various rates: gasoline can exploding vs. compost pile nutritional energetics involves the study of the sources and transformations of energy into new products (mainly we are concerned with growth or tissue deposition) of all dry matter we consume, 70-90% goes to synthesis of new products Energy Forms \nMatter and energy are basically the same it is often convenient to consider energy a property of matter (kcal/g feed) nutritive value of food items is often reflected by calories what you are used to seeing in the store is not calories, but kilocalories (kcal s) common form of energy in the cell is ATP Energy Forms All processes in the animal body involve changes in energy the word \" energy \" was first introduced by Thomas Yound in 1807, and defined as \"ability to work\" found in many forms: heat, kinetic, electromagnetic, radiant, nuclear and chemical for our purposes, chemical energy is the most important (e.g., ATP) Heat Energy The measurement of energy

two specific proteins: complex I and complex II Chloroplast Chlorophyll In diatoms and dinoflagellates, the principal light-gathering pigments are chlorophyll c and peridinin, blue-greens:

reflected other pigments absorb other wavelengths of light, causing water to take on other colors i.e., color depends on what phytoplankton are present accessory pigments: e.g., fucoxanthin Photosynthesis Plants, because they can produce their own organic matter are considered autotrophic photosynthesis is also a reductive reaction, simply because it generates oxygen for aquaculture, you must remember: 1) it is the primary source of energy 2) source of all organic matter 3) large amount of DO are released Respiration from a biochemical viewpoint, it is the opposite of photosynthesis
