Activity 3 - Soil Air1. Ask each student group or pair to place 1 cup of dry soil into a 2-cup container.2. Students should slowly pour 1 cup of water into the soil container until the soil is “saturated” or all the dry soil is “mud.” While they were pouring the water they should notice the “air bubbles” that are rising to the surface.3. Students should measure the amount of water left and subtract it from 1 cup.4. Lead students to infer that the amount of water in the soil sample was approximately the amount of air that was displaced. As the students added the water to the sample, they should have seen bubbles, until the sample was saturated.5. Have students compare the amount of water that they were able to pour into their soil samples. There will be differences depending on the soil texture and organic matter. What is the percentage of air in the soil sample? If they were able to add a 1/4 cup of water, the sample contained 25 percent air.6. Using the components of the soil transparency, and the movable yarn, explain how air and water amounts change.Discussion1. What are the components of soil? (mineral matter, organic matter, water, air)2. Which two components are the most variable? (water and air) Why?3. Why do worms come up to the surface after a drenching rain? (to breathe)Background Soil is naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose material at the surface of the earth,which is capable of supporting plant and animal life. In simple terms, soil is comprised ofthree components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase which accounts for approxi-mately 50 percent of the volume in a typical soil is a mixture of mineral and organic matterand gives soil its mass. Soil particles fit loosely (depending on the particle size) leaving“empty” pore spaces. The pore spaces are then filled with water (liquid) and air (gas). Thewater and air in an “average” soil make up the other half of the soil’s volume. All soils are made up of the four major components; however the portions will vary. Themineral matter is derived from the weathering of hard rock at the earth’s surface. An“average” soil is made up of approximately 45 percent mineral content by volume, theamount and size of mineral particles vary. In an “average” soil, the amount of organic matter (living and dead organisms) willrange between 1 and 5 percent. Organic matter is mostly composed of dead plant andanimal remains. This decay in the upper layer of soil, or topsoil, is the major source ofplant nutrients and other organisms. Organic matter is what makes a soil fertile. Soils highin organic matter do not compress as tightly allowing for more air spaces. Organic par-ticles also hold the moisture by absorbing water. Water is held in the small air spacesUtah Agriculture in the Classroom 10",1.3434512615203857],["tool used to measure mass",1.2500839233398438],["tool used to measure mass",1.2500839233398438],["Session 1: Capacity - Present students with two containers of similar capacity but different shapes.

The term should not be confused with weight , which is the measure of the force of gravity (see gravitation ) acting on a body. Under ordinary conditions the mass of a body can be considered to be constant; its weight, however, is not constant, since the force of gravity varies from place to place. There are two ways of referring to mass, depending on the law of physics defining it: gravitational mass and inertial mass. The gravitational mass of a body may be determined by comparing the body on a beam balance with a set of standard masses; in this way the gravitational factor is eliminated. The inertial mass of a body is a measure of the body's resistance to acceleration by some external force. One body has twice as much inertial mass as another body if it offers twice as much force in opposition to the same acceleration. All evidence seems to indicate that the gravitational and inertial masses of a body are equal, as demanded by Einstein's equivalence principle of relativity ; so that at the same location equal (inertial) masses have equal weights. Because the numerical value for the mass of a body is the same anywhere in the world, it is used as a basis of reference for many physical measurements, such as density and heat capacity. According to the special theory of relativity, mass is not strictly constant but increases with the speed according to the formula",0.8786128759384155],["They started with small cups but soon they were using skyphoi, cups which could hold 1 \"chous\" (a liquid measure equivalent to about 3 litres).",0.8784972429275513],["A variety of small rocks or gravel, about two cups for each group",0.876201331615448],["A variety of small rocks or gravel, about two cups for each group",0.876201331615448],["Other tools measure performance, graphically compare two Simulink models, and analyze the extent to which a model is exercised during simulation.",0.8758465051651001],["Other tools measure performance, graphically compare two Simulink models, and analyze the extent to which a model is exercised during simulation.",0.8758465051651001],["Other tools measure performance, graphically compare two Simulink models, and analyze the extent to which a model is exercised during simulation.",0.8758465051651001],["Other tools measure performance, graphically compare two Simulink models, and analyze the extent to which a model is exercised during simulation.",0.8758465051651001],["By using analytical geochemical tools such as x-ray fluorescence (XRF) or inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) the two forms of Fe (Fe2+ and Fe3+) can be measured in ancient rocks therefore determining the redox potential for ancient soils.",0.8746427893638611],["The students will use both measuring cups and spoons and cylinders.",0.8737220168113708],["The students will use both measuring cups and spoons and cylinders.",0.8737220168113708],["The students will use both measuring cups and spoons and cylinders.",0.8737220168113708],["The students will use both measuring cups and spoons and cylinders.",0.8737220168113708],["The students will use measuring cups, spoons, and cylinders.",0.8737220168113708],["Students will make their own measures using Styrofoam cups.",0.8737220168113708],["During: The student will be checked for their understanding on using a measuring cup.",0.8737220168113708],["The student will observe, describe, measure, compare and contrast common objects, using simple tools including but not limited to ruler, thermometer and balance.",0.8733830451965332]]
