permafrost has no influence on the vegetation since the growth of plants depends only on the thickness of the upper soil layer that thaws out in the summer Low summer temperatures are partially due to

are typically under 30 m high Among the most economically important biomes as they are a source of lumber and pulp Temperate forests Occur in climate slightly warmer than those of the boreal forest Found throughout North America, southern South America, Europe, Asia, and Japan Common species are maples, beeches, oaks, and hickories (typically taller than boreal species) Among the biomes most changed by humans because they occur in regions long dominated by civilization Temperate rain forests Occur under moderate temperature regimes where the rainfall exceeds 250 cm yr-1 The \"giant

feature of this biome Dense stands of shrubs that rarely exceed a few meters in height Occur in Mediterranean climates - low rainfall that is concentrated in the cool season Found along coast of
