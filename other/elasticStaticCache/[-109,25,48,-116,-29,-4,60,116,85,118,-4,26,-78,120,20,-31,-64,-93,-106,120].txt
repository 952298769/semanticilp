as clastic) sedimentary rocks consist of pieces of pre-existing rocks for example sandstone Chemical Sedimentary Rocks consist of chemicals from pre-existing rocks for example rock salt Processes involved in making Sedimentary Rocks Weathering Mechanical = smaller pieces produced Chemical = new minerals produced, chemicals released Transportation moves sediment and chemicals Deposition

Detrital rocks names based on particle size for example, rocks made of sand-sized particles are called sandstones chemical sedimentary rocks named for the dominate mineral that they contain for example, rocks made up of the mineral calcite are called limestones limestones are the most common chemical sedimentary rocks, most contain calcite skeletons of organisms such as coral Sedimentary Rocks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) ( Toronto Rocks p 3-4, 10-11) Layer II is the bedrock which consists of limestones interlayered with shales the fossils found in these rocks show that their depositional environment was a warm, shallow sea Layer III consists of geologically young Quaternary sediments deposited by glaciers or in glacially-influenced lakes these sediments have not been cemented into rocks The Niagara Escarpment forms a ridge along the western boundary of the GTA It reveals bedrock (the solid rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water that is driven off when clay minerals are heated Types of Metamorphism Fig

minerals such as micas Fig 6.9, p.134 produced when minerals become oriented due to differential pressure Foliated Metamorphic Rocks named on the basis of the size of the minerals grains and their
