DRAFT April 10, 2014 117 _ Water can make objects move. _ Water exerts a force that causes objects like the paper boat to move. Assessment A plastic ball is placed in a basin with water. Write two ways to make the ball move without touching or blowing unto into it. 1. ___________________________ 2.___________________________ Assignment Draw a situation where water is used to move an object. Lesson 2. Describing the Location of an Object After it has Moved Activity 1. Make it Move with a Magnet! Duration: 1 day Background Information A magnet is a solid object that has the ability to attract other magnets or magnetic objects. Magnetic objects are made up of iron and some other metals. Not all metals are attracted to a magnet (e.g. aluminium, copper, zinc, and brass). A magnet doesnâ€™t have to get into contact with a touch a magnetic object to affect it. It can attract a magnetic object from a short distance. Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. describe how a magnet can move objects; and 2. identify materials that can be moved by magnets. Materials For the teacher: Different magnets, chart similar to activity 6 in the LM For the pupils: Paper clips, cardboard, thumbtacks, small nails, staple wire, eraser, crayon, plastic bottle caps, LM (Activity 6: Make it Move with a Magnet!) Procedure A. Review Ask: What are the things that can make objects move that have been discussed in the previous lessons? (People, animals, wind, and water can make objects move.)",2.213327407836914],["Station 2: Using a variety of small objects and pictures Glue magnetic strip to cardboard Glue objects to cardboard for your refrigerator magnet.",2.0355095863342285],["Station 2: Using a variety of small objects and pictures Glue magnetic strip to cardboard Glue objects to cardboard for your refrigerator magnet.",2.0355095863342285]]
