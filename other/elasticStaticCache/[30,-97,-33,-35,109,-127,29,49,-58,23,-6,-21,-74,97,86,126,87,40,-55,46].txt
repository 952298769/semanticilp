Covalent solids are insoluble in all solvents but may be chemically attacked by some liquids or vapors Metals are the next most difficult solids to dissolve Remember, reactions with solvents are not equivalent to being dissolved in a solvent Metals are insoluble in common liquid solvents but can dissolve in each other to make an alloy Mercury is special because it is a liquid at room temperature and a solution of another metal in mercury is called an amalgam Ionic solids do not dissolve unless considerable solvent-ion interactions exist to counterbalance the energy cost of breaking the ions free from the lattice Some ionic solids dissolve in water because it is a highly polar liquid in which strong ion-dipole interactions exist between the water molecules and ions in solution We use the solubility guidelines to categorize the ionic salts Molecular solids readily dissolve in solvents with similar types of intermolecular forces Solubility of Gases in Liquids A few gases interact strongly with water to form concentrated aqueous solutions Gas solubility increases with the partial pressure of the gas in contact with the solution ( Henry's Law ): C i = K H * p where C i is the concentration of gas in the solution, p is the partial pressure of the same gas in the vapor phase above the solution, and K H is the Henry's law constant Properties of Aqueous Solutions The normal
