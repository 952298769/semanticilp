2 into organic molecules (sugars, etc ) (3) Ecosystems also require Nutrients : essential building blocks of all life they cycle on the planet: biogeochemical cycles 17 nutrients are essential if a specific key nutrient is \"limited\", organism development is inhibited Some dynamic properties of ecosystems: food chain : group of organisms that feed on each other food web : a complicated network of food chains trophic structure: pyramid shape refers to the pathways by which energy is transferred and nutrients are cycled through trophic levels primary producers autotrophic plants and microscopic photosynthetic organisms first and essential producers of organic material in any ecosystem primary and secondary consumers heterotrophic feed directly or indirectly on producers primary consumers : feed directly on autotrophs ( herbivores ) secondary consumers : feed on primary consumers Characterizing trophic levels: biomass productivity gross productivity net productivity ecological efficiency the % transfer of energy from one level to the next decomposers fungi and bacteria, also heterotrophic reintegrate or break down detrital material Summary: 3 components of ecosystems: energy flow nutrients and nutrient cycling biotic and abiotic interactions But what s the bigger picture beyond the \"ecosystem\"?",1.0598763227462769],["and Gary Thompson, Associate
