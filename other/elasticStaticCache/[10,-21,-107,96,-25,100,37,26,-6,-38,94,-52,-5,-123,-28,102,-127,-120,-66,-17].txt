EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF PLANTS Plants Derived From Multicellular Green Algae Biochemical and morphological similarities Only organisms that form cell plate during mitosis Plants Divided into Twelve Phyla fig 33.1 Terms phylum and division are interchangeable, the former is preferred Old term \"bryophyte\" now constitute now three separate phyla Lack or have poorly developed vascular strands Include mosses, liverworts and hornworts Vascular plants are subdivided into nine phyla Have food and water conducting strands Include ferns, conifers, and flowering plants Share a semiterrestrial green algal ancestor 430 million years old THE GREEN INVASION OF THE LAND Plants Occur Almost Exclusively on Land Characteristic shared with arthropods and fungi Most likely that they all evolved on land Plant cell walls provide protection from desiccation Relatively impermeable outer cuticle formed from waxy cutin Stoma allow passage of gases for photosynthesis fig 33.2 Stoma also allow passage of water vapor Evolution of Vascular Systems Systems capable of efficient conduction of liquids fig 33.3 Helped achieve ecological dominance on land Specialized strands of elongated cells Travel from roots through stems to leaves Conduct water and minerals from roots, carbohydrates from leaves Early vascular plants had well-developed conducting systems fig 33.4 Adaptation to Terrestrial Habitats Enhanced by mycorrhizal fungi Features of plants themselves Specialization of parts above and below the ground: shoots, roots Expansion of photosynthetic areas: leaves Specializations in reproductive features THE PLANT LIFE CYCLE Alternation of Generations Alternation of diploid sporophyte with haploid gametophyte fig 33.5 Generalized life cycle In sporophyte, meiosis in spore mother cells produces haploid spores Spores divide by mitosis to produce multicellular diploid gametophyte Gametophyte produces haploid gametes Gametes fuse forming diploid zygote Zygote mitotically divides to form sporophyte Specialization in the Plant Life Cycle Liverwort, moss and fern gametophytes are small and free living Moss and liverwort gametophyte dominates, sporophyte reduced Vascular plant Are primarily sporophytic, gametophytes are reduced Gametophytes dependent on, enclosed within sporophyte MOSSES, LIVERWORTS AND HORNWORTS Traditionally Grouped Together as Bryophytes fig 33.6
