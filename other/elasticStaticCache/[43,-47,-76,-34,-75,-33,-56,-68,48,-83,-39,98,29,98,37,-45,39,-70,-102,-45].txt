[["Five major tenets or hypotheses Perpetual Change culmination of Lyell&#146;s ideas evident in the fossil record Common Descent present life forms have arisen from common ancestral relatives idea of phylogeny organisms which share many traits have a more recent common ancestor that do those which share only a few traits modern confirmation of this hypothesis comes from areas of molecular and developmental biology research has shown that the same genes control the development of flies and man these genes have not been formed multiple times, they are the same genes which have been passed down from primitive ancestral species into all subsequent animals Multiplication of Species new species arise from alteration (mutations) in existing species this concept come directly from the idea of common decent adaptive radiation this is the production of ecologically diverse species from a common ancestor what make two organisms different species within a genus descent from a common ancestor inability \nto interbreed maintenance of genotypic and phenotypic cohesion how species arise is still a hotbed of biological research some argue that a new mutation won&#146;t produce an entirely new structure - feather for example these structures probably arose in a primordial form and then were used in a new way, which provided a selective advantage to the organism that used the structure as such - ties in with natural selection speciation creation of reproductive barriers geologic events migration of populations requires long periods of time or short depending on what event separates splits the original species into groups Gradualism - gradual change tied to perpetual change the evident anatomical differences that we see between organisms is due to the accumulation of many small alterations over long periods of time Punctuated Equilibrium a counter theory to gradualism there were rapid alterations in body plans also applies to overall evolutionary events such as extinctions breeding of domestic species can result in very marked changes in a single generation the divergent offspring must not be selected against if the change is to be maintained Truth is undoubtedly a combination of these ideas Natural Selection selective pressures environmental conditions selects for organisms which can survive in those conditions adaptations that make an organism better able to survive are &quot;selected for&quot; these animals survive more frequently and therefore pass on their genetic programs to subsequent generations gradual changes in environment allow for gradual changes in organisms evidence of rapid changes in environment also selecting for organisms peppered moth light and dark pigmented individuals pollution of the environment during the industrial revolution by coal soot artificially darken tree bark and lichens growing on them light colored moths became easy picking for predators while the darker variety remained camouflaged variation already occurred in species - soot was selective pressure insecticides varieties of mosquitos are arising that are resistant to poisons",1.202311635017395]]
