Wetlands are areas that are covered by shallow water for part of the year. Marshes and swamps are examples of wetlands. Habitats include both living and nonliving parts. The living things in a wetland include birds, fish, frogs, and insects. The nonliving things include water, soil, sunlight, and air.",2.7037816047668457],["Ecosystems: Ecosystems are groups of living and nonliving things that function together in a particular environment. For example, prairie dogs, birds, insects, low-lying grasses, and shrubs (living elements) interact with each other as well as with dry soil, high winds, and occasional downpours (nonliving elements) to make up the shortgrass prairie ecosystem.",2.6042120456695557],["Ask students, “Are there any living things that come from nothing/empty space?” (no) To the bottom of the list, add the words and a brief definition: “Spontaneous generation―From nothing.” Explain the hypothesis of spontaneous generation, which stated that living things could arise from nonliving things.

I also teach kindergarten and I have found that although the children can identify which things are living and which are nonliving they can not tell me why. To help with this we study living and nonliving things to come up with unique qualities of each that make them living and nonliving. For the nonliving items we investigate rocks, pencils, and those plastic plants that move with sunlight. For the living organisms we investigate the plants in our garden and an insect we find outside. From our investigation the children develop qualities that make certain things living and other nonliving. We talk about how they are the same and how they are different in terms of needs and characteristics. In addition to the investigations we also use videos from Discovery Education and I also like the book \"What's Alive\" by Kathleen Weidner Zoehfeld.",2.175032138824463]]
