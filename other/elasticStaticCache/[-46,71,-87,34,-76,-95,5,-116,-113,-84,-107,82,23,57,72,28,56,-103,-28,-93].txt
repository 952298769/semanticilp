and heard Night sounds echo bittersweet Have you ever climbed up highest peak And looked out at earths round edge Or noticed mountains covered with trees Dressed in autumn s rich montage Have you ever laid on an aching back And watched stars in \na desert sky Do you follow a winding summer creek Or live life as the crows fly by Andrew Carden Sunrise Sunset The bright and magnificent sun rose early today He helped trees grow Melted bitter snow Tomorrow he will rise in another ceremonious play The sun went down furiously in a stunning sunset With purples and blues Then moon appeared new The dark, light-spotted horizon he angrily met by Andrew Carden Autumn A placid wind blows through the tired trees Splashes of brilliant red paint the leaves Pairs of Juncos bounce around on the ground Chirping contently at seeds they ve found Hints of winter s chill are felt in the air Autumn s first frost catches farmers unaware Like misting rain the leaves begin to fall How magnificent is the splendor of

The Sun and the Moon With a warmth like the familiarity of the womb His rays encircle and bathe me His power and steadiness give a feeling of security With age-old precision he rises each day Never \ncomplaining, lighting the earth With a pleasant unwavering smile Like new fallen snow enticing me to play Her radiance draws me out into the night As her beams dance with the shadows Even the stars take note of the bedazzling light Each night she changes, ever so slightly Entertaining and pleasing with her countless forms With each new mask a drama unfolds by Andrew Carden The Tree In the heart of a country field Stands a solitary tree With no one to share it s secrets With except for maybe me During the winter s icy months Bough and branch harbor snow Sounds of hunters crunching feet On the frosty bark echo Spring Rains wash away the sins Of December s chilly freeze Traveling winds carry it s thoughts Across the listening seas Robins come to pay their homage As if this natures throne Was a type of heavenly portal Through which His glory shone Sunbathed branches silhouetted Against a pale blue sky Listen to the praise of crickets And the whippoorwills cry Dancing slowly with clouds
