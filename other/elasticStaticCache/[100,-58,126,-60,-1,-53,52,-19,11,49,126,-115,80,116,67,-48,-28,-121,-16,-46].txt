and night are caused by this movement of the earth (rotation around the sun) 400 The earth takes one year to make one of these around the sun (revolution) 500 Seasons are caused by the earth's revolution around the sun and by this (the tilt of the earth) Simple Machines 100 A ramp is an example of this type of simple machine (inclined plane) 200 This makes raising a flag up a flagpole much easier (pulley) 300 A screw is actually one of these wrapped around a post (inclined plane) 400 Two simple machines found in a pair of scissors (lever, wedge, sometimes wheel and axle) 500 The center
