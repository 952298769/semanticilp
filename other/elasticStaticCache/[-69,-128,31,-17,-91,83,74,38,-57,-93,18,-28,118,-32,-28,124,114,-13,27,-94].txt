[["Animals adapt to many different things and for many different reasons. They mostly adapt to the environment or they adapt physically. Animals can also adapt to different en…vironments by natural selection, a process in which only the strongest animals can survive. Then, those who have survived can mate. This helps them adapt. EDIT: They would also adapt by having thick fur if they live in the arctic or having something to live without water for a longtime if they live in the desert. They adapt to their environment with different characteristics like how the dog gets his winter coat in the wintertime and sheds the winter coat in summertime. The adaptations to a environment from an animal are not learned behaviors but they are inherited traits. -Chey Hansen Snohomish Wa",1.4961111545562744],["Behaviour adaptation is the response an animal gives to _ environmental stimulus and a change in that behaviour.

These special adaptations include: Elephants The Trunk The elephant's trunk does so much more than smell. This \"hose nose\" is also used for drinking (actually blowing water into the mouth), communication, feeding, chemo-communication, offense/defense, touching, lifting, greeting, caressing, throwing dust, and just about any other activity an elephant is involved in. Elephants Elephants Ears In the hot African climate, keeping cool is a constant challenge. Believe it or not, an elephant's enormous ears (weighing up to 110 pounds each), while exceptionally good at picking up sound, are also used as an air conditioner of sorts. When the temperature rises, elephants flap their ears. This cools blood flowing through vessels in the ears, which then flows back to the body, cooling it in turn. Giraffe Giraffes have many obvious physical adaptations to help them survive in the African savannas. Giraffe Camouflaged coat - Patches of different sizes and colors help hide the giraffe in the African savanna. Fringed tail - A fringe at the end of the tail keeps flies and other pests away. Giraffe Long neck - It is used to reach leaves in tall acacia trees. Long front legs - Unlike many animals, the giraffe's front legs are longer than the hind legs. These long front legs make it easier to reach tall leaves. Echidna An Echidna is a mammal and is also known as the Spiny Anteater. An Echidna's body is covered with long sharp spines set in short fur. These spines are the Echidnas defense mechanism. When attacked, it rolls itself in a tight ball and burrows out of reach. Echidna Echidnas have no teeth, but uses a long sticky tongue to penetrate ant and termite nests, which they have gauged open with their strong ripping claws. Echidna Shelter is where ever the echidna finds it and this could be in logs, under bushes or in caves. They are 35 - 45 cms long and can weigh 2-7 kg. The Echidna has a spur on its ankle but it is not poisonous. Gecko At 28 cm long, The Round Island Day Gecko is the largest of 27 species of day geckos. The smallest day gecko is only about 8 cm long. Most day geckos are bright green in color. The Round Island Day Gecko is probably the dullest looking one of all. It lives on palm trees and is perfectly camouflaged against the brown bark of the main stem of the tree. Gecko Geckos have special feet to help them climb up smooth surfaces. The flattened toes have elongated scales. A microscopic view would show thousands of tiny, hooked bristles that can hold on to any surface. This means they can easily climb up palm trees, as well as hide on the underside of leaves. Gecko They also have sharp teeth to penetrate the exo-skeleton of an insect. If attacked, Round Island Day Geckos have a unique way of defending themselves. Gecko The tail just drops off and lies moving around on the ground. Hopefully the enemy will pay attention to the tail while the gecko escapes. The stump quickly heals, and they will eventually grow a new tail. Kangaroo These animals are mostly found in the dry inland Australia, including desert, grassland, mallee, and mulga country. It is able to go with out drinking as long as green grass is available and it adapts well to drought. Kangaroo Despite its name, the Red Kangaroo is sometimes a blue-grey color, particularly the female. Even though these animals look cuddly, they are to be approached with caution. They have evolved with a  large claw attached to its hind leg. Kangaroo Red Kangaroos can hop as fast as 40 mph (64 km).  They use this as their first line of defense.  Kangaroos have a tendon in the leg which acts like a rubber band, conserving energy as the animal moves lands.  Red Kangaroos actually expand less energy in locomotion as they move faster, up to very fast speeds. Shark A shark is a fish. It breathes through its gills, has a backbone and lives in water. However, unlike all other fish, its skeleton is made from cartilage, not bone and they do not have scales but denticles. Also, they have five to seven gill slits rather than one each side as in bony fish. Shark Sharks can detect one part of blood per ten billion parts of water – that means they could detect one drop of blood in an area the size of an Olympic swimming pool! The nose of a shark is only used for smell, unlike in humans where we also use our noses for breathing. African Wild Dog Location: South Africa and east of Sahara African Wild Dog Wild dogs have a canine body shape like a wolf's, but they have larger, bat like ears and white tipped tails.  They have splotches of black, yellow, white, and dark brown, with no two dogs marked exactly the same. African Wild Dog Wild dogs have a highly developed social structure.  They live in packs that vary from 10 to 15 animals, including males, females, and young.  Their packs are nomadic, and they roam across a range of 1 to 30 miles a day.  Members of the pack cooperate when hunting and raising their young. African Wild Dog Wild dogs have developed incredible speed and endurance for attacking prey.  They have been clocked at running 37 miles per hour for distances over 3 miles.  They also have specialized, large, bat like ears that allow for excellent auditory ability used for hunting and ritual ceremonies Lion A lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away. Roaring is believed to have a territorial function and to help animals locate each other. Lion Territories are scented marked with urine, feces, and head rubbing. Lions mark with their claws on trees and other signposts.  The mane of the male  provides protection from the claws and teeth of other males. Lion They eat anything they can catch and kill, and groups have even been observed killing rhinoceros. A lion can eat up to 35 grams of meat at a sitting. They drink freely when water is available, but they can survive only on the water they get from their prey for long periods of time. Lion Lions can run at speeds over 30 mph, but only over short distances. This speed is insufficient for catching a large antelope, so group stalking is an important hunting strategy. Lions appear to assess how much effort will be required for taking down a particular target, and if the prey is small enough to be taken by a single female, the other members of the hunting group will let her catch it alone. Polar Bear Polar bears have thick white fur. Their fur and layers of fat beneath their skin protect them from the Arctic cold. Their fur also provides camouflage when they are hunting. Polar bears have a keen sense of smell. They can smell food as much as 10 miles away. On land polar bears can run for short bursts at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. Polar Bear They hunt seals such as the ringed seal and other animals for food. Skunk Sometimes the skunk will dig its own den, but it may also move into another mammals den. Skunks also live under old buildings. The skunk drags dried leaves and grass into its burrow to make a mat. In the winter, it might form a ball of grass and push this into the door of the den to keep out the cold wind. Skunk The skunk is the size of a house cat. Its eyes ane ears are small. It can not see too well, but its sense of hearing is good. During the day, a skunk sleeps. It hunts at night, walking slowly along, catching insects and looking for small fruit. It also eats meadow mice, gophers, moles, and chipmunks. Skunk The skunk has musk glands and can shoot a liquid that has a terrible odor. First, it gives a warning when something approaches it. With its legs stiff, the skunk stamps the ground with its feet, snaps its teeth, and its hairs stand up. Then,if necessary, the skunk swings its rear end round , lifts its tail up out of the way and shoots its musk. The liquid can shoot out as far as four meters. If it hits the enemy in the eyes, the enemy cannot see for a few moments. Zebra Each zebra has its own stripe pattern. The zebras recognize each other by their stripe pattern and by their smell. Some species have narrow close set stripes, while others have broader stripes. Zebras like to help groom each other. Zebra Zebras are black with white stripes.

We explore a few recent findings, common misconceptions and amazing adaptations. - Ben Mauk Crocodiles Swallow Stones for Swimming The stomach of a crocodile is a rocky place to be, for more than one reason. To begin with, a croc's digestive system encounters everything from turtles, fish and birds to giraffes, buffaloes, lions and even (when defending territory) other crocodiles. In addition to that bellyful-o'- ecosystem, rocks show up too. The reptiles swallow large stones that stay permanently in their bellies. It's been suggested these are used for ballast in diving. Whale Milk Not On Low-Fat Diets Nursing a newborn is no \"small\" feat for the whale, whose calf emerges, after 10 to 12 months in the womb, about a third the mother's length (that's a 30-foot baby for the Blue whale). The mother squirts milk into the newborn's mouth using muscles around the mammary gland while the baby holds tight to a nipple (yes, whales have them). At nearly 50 percent fat, whale milk has around 10 times the fat content of human milk, which helps calves achieve some serious growth spurtseas much as 200 pounds per day. Birds Use Landmarks to Navigate Long Journeys Can you imagine a road trip vacation without missed exits, stubborn drivers or map-folding disasters? Of course noteyou're not a bird. Pigeons can fly thousands of miles to find the same roosting spot with no navigational difficulties. Some species of birds, like the Arctic tern, make a 25,000 mile round-trip journey every year. Many species use built-in ferromagnets to detect their orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. A November 2006 study published in Animal Behaviour suggests that pigeons also use familiar landmarks on the ground below to help find their way home. For Beavers, Days Get Longer in Winter Beavers become near shut-ins during winter, living off of previously stored food or the deposits of fat in their distinctive tails. They conserve energy by avoiding the cold outdoors, opting instead to remain in dark lodgings inside their pile of wood and mud. As a result these rodents, which normally emerge at sunset and turn in at sunrise, have no light cues to entrain their sleep cycle. The beaver's biological sense of time shifts, and she develops a \"free running circadian rhythm\" of 29-hour days. Mole-Rats aren't Blind With their puny eyes and underground lifestyle, African mole-rats have long been considered the Mr. Magoos of rodents, detecting little light and, it has been suggested, using their eyes more for sensing changes in air currents than for actual vision. But findings of the past few years have shown that African mole-rats have a keen, if limited, sense of sight. And they don't like what they see, according to a report in the November 2006 Animal Behaviour. Light may suggest that a predator has broken into a tunnel, which could explain why subterranean diggers developed sight in the first place. Baby Chicks and Brotherhood It's a mistake to think of evolution as producing selfish animals concerned only with their own survival. Altruism abounds in cases where a helping hand will encourage the survival of genetic material similar to one's own. Baby chicks practice this \"kin selection\" by making a special chirp while feeding. This call announces the food find to nearby chicks, who are probably close relations and so share many of the chick's genes. The key to natural selection isn't survival of the fittest animal. It's survival of the fittest genetic material, and so brotherly behavior that favors close relations will thrive. Many Fish Swap Sex Organs With so many land creatures to wonder at, it's easy to forget that some of the weirdest activities take place deep in the ocean. The strange practice of hermaphroditism is more common among species of fish than within any other group of vertebrates. Some fish change sex in response to hormonal cycle or environmental changes. Others simultaneously possess both male and female sex organs. Giraffes Compensate for Height with Unique Blood Flow The stately giraffe, whose head sits some 16 feet up atop an unlikely pedestal, adapted his long neck to compete for foliage with other grazers. While the advantage of reach is obvious, some difficulties arise at such a height. The heart must pump twice as hard as a cow's to get blood up to the brain, and a complex blood vessel system is needed to ensure that blood doesn't rush to the head when bent over. Six feet below the heart, the skin of the legs must then be extremely tight to prevent blood from pooling at the hooves.

When a reptile is too hot, it will lie parallel to the sun's rays, go into a shady area, open its mouth wide, lighten its skin color or burrow into cool soil. Some cold-blooded animals, such as bees or dragonflies, shiver to stay warm when in a cold environment. Fish who live in areas where the winters are cold move to deeper waters during the colder months or migrate to warmer waters. Some fish have a special protein in their blood which acts like anti-freeze to help them survive very cold water temperatures. Snakes, lizards, toads, frogs, salamanders and most turtles will hibernate during cool winters.

Snakes and lizards' body temperature changes with the outside temperature - they are called poikilotherms. In people, normal body temperature is approximately 98.6_ F. While this temperature varies during the day; it stays relatively constant, regardless of whether it is 50_ or 90_ outside. The body's regulates temperature in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This brain center has several sensors that are critical for temperature regulation. In humans, the most important center for controlling heat is the sweating center. This center, which stimulates the sweat glands to release sweat, is less important in dogs. Each gram of sweat that evaporates gets rid of half a calorie of heat. In dogs, the panting center, which stimulates panting, helps the animal get rid of heat. Panting involves rapid shallow breathing that causes evaporation of fluid on the tongue. Dogs have a rich blood supply in their tongues. Heat produced in the dog's muscles and tissues enter the blood and is transported to the tongue, where it is eliminated through panting. The blood stream is critically important for regulating temperature in both dogs and humans. Water is the most plentiful substance in our bodies. Water is important for temperature control because it can hold a lot of heat; it can also carry heat to the surface via the blood stream. The spleen is a blood storage organ that helps control heat, particularly during physical activity. When you or your dog exercise, the spleen contracts, releasing blood into the blood stream. This blood is then available to help carry excess heat to the surface. Relative to body size, dogs have larger spleens than humans do. The relatively greater release of blood from the spleen during exercise is one reason why dogs usually have better endurance than people.? http://k9power.com/don'tget.htm Even though dogs have sweat glands in their feet and ears, they are not very efficient, and play a small role in thermoregulation. A dog?s fur protects not only against cold, but heat too! ?A dog's skin is made up of the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is an outer layer of cells that constantly gets replaced. The dermis is found under the epidermis and supplies it with nerves and blood. Sweat glands are found in the dermis along with sebaceous glands which feed oil into hair follicles in the epidermis to lubricate the skin. Hair grows up through follicles from papillae in the lower epidermis. More than one hair grows through the same follicle in dogs and one hair from each follicle, the guard hair, is usually longer than the others. Dogs can achieve piloerection, raising of the guard hairs, by contracting or lengthening muscle fibers in the dermis (Whitehead et al. 1999). A dog's fur insulates it against cold and heat (Johnson 1977) with the degree of insulation increasing with fur thickness (Schmidt-Nielson 1997). Dogs normally shed twice a year, in the spring and in the autumn. Shedding in the spring gets rid of hair that is not needed for the summer and shedding in the autumn is in preparation for growing a thicker coat for the winter.? http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/anphys/2000/Hatfield/Hatfield3.htm This site begins by discussing the opposite, heat maintenance, but moves onto heat dissipation in dogs: ?Anyone who has dealt with dogs knows that the dog pants when he is hot. It is his panting mechanism that allows the dog to lose heat he does not need when the weather is hot. The mechanism functions on the principle of evaporation. As I have said before, evaporation is extremely effective because you can lose almost five-hundred and forty times as much heat without changing the temperature of the air at all. This evaporation takes place in the dog's nose and is enhanced by the fact that there are many folds of tissue in the nose which increase the surface area that the air is in contact with. In addition, this tissue actually perspires and has a large blood supply, thereby acting much like the radiator in the car. This makes a good mechanism of heat loss, but one needs some way in which to shut it off when one does not want to lose heat. Since the animal must breathe and must take in a pretty constant volume of air at all times, because varying this volume of air would interfere with other bodily functions, people have often been concerned as to how this is controlled. A recent study, just published, has looked into this problem and has come to this conclusion. The air is brought in through the dog's nose and in the case of panting is exhaled through the mouth. In doing this, the air picks up much moisture and heat from the nose, this cooling the nose and drying it. When it is exhaled, it is exhaled through the mouth and since there is much less blood supply to the area around the mouth and the surface area is much less, almost all of the moisture is absorbed and the heat will leave the dog's mouth and be lost. When the dog does not wish to lose body heat, he simply exhales the air that he has brought in through the nose back out the nose, in which case a great proportion of the moisture and heat will be returned to the large surface area and the membranes in the nose thus minimizing the loss of heat. Therefore, when an animal is hot, the hotter the animal is the more of the air he brings in through his nose will be exhaled through the mouth, thus the wide open, tongue out position. If he does not wish to lose heat when it is cold out, he will breathe in and out through his nose and keep his mouth closed. The provides a quite sensitive means of temperature control, particularly in the case of the animal who has other means of protecting himself from the cold and from the outside temperature as do the long-haired Northern breeds. The animal, therefore, in general has developed enough capacity of heat loss through his panting mechanism to compensate for the very wide swings in temperature.? http://www.samoyed.org/heat.html ?Major changes in body fluids and tissues associated with over heating is known as Hyperthermin. This condition may be influenced by the dog?s muscular exertion, physical condition, hair coat, and surrounding factors like relative humidity and ventilation. The severity and duration of hyperthermia is influenced by 3 separate but often interrelated syndromes. http://www.webheads.co.uk/sleddog/ezine/pdf/Heat_Stress.pdf ?A special circulatory adaptation called countercurrent heat exchange enables both species to maintain the appropriate body temperature in their extremities. Countercurrent heat exchange is only one of many clever adaptations mammals have to help them to deal with variable temperatures. All mammals are endothermic: they maintain and regulate their own body temperature. Living in widespread environments around the world, mammals face daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperatures and some--for example those living in harsh arctic or tropical habitats--face extreme cold or heat. To maintain their correct body temperature, mammals must be able to produce and conserve body heat in colder temperatures as well as dissipate excess body heat in warmer temperatures.?

In health under normal conditions the temperature of man varies between 36 _C and 38 _C, or if the thermometer be placed in the axilla, between 36.25 _C and 37.5 _C In the mouth the reading would be from 0.25 _C to 1.5 _C higher than this; and in the rectum some 0.9 _C higher still. The temperature of infants and young children has a much greater range than this, and is susceptible of wide divergencies from comparatively slight causes. Of the lower warm-blooded animals, there are some that appear to be cold-blooded at birth. Kittens, rabbits and puppies, if removed from their surroundings shortly after birth, lose their body heat until their temperature has fallen to within a few degrees of that of the surrounding air. But such animals are at birth blind, helpless and in some cases naked. Animals who are born when in a condition of greater development can maintain their temperature fairly constant. In strong, healthy infants a day or two old the temperature rises slightly, but in that of weakly, ill-developed children it either remains stationary or falls. The cause of the variable temperature in infants and young immature animals is the imperfect development of the nervous regulating mechanism.? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation#Variations_in_the_temperature_of_man_and_some_other_animals http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation#Variations_in_the_temperature_of_man_and_some_other_animals Dogs CAN suffer from hyperthermia: ?Heatstroke occurs when normal body mechanisms cannot keep the body's temperature in a safe range. Animals do not have efficient cooling systems (like humans who sweat) and get overheated easily. A dog with moderate heatstroke (body temperature from 104_ to 106_F) can recover within an hour if given prompt first aid and veterinary care (normal body temperature is 100-102.5_F). Severe heatstroke (body temperature over 106_F) can be deadly and immediate veterinary assistance is needed.? http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid=1683 ?Some causes of hyperthermia include exercise, being left in a parked car, a thick coat, short faces (such as with bulldogs and boxers), inadequate outdoor shelter, prolonged seizures, lung and heart diseases and a history of having hyperthermal episodes. Dogs have few ways to eliminate heat. When they pant, the tongue surface enlarges in order to dissipate as much heat as possible. Dogs sweat on the pads of their feet. http://www.ehow.com/how_3025_detect-treat-hyperthermia.html ?Before we leave this general consideration of the subject, it may be of interest to note that animals have numerous ways of keeping themselves cool. Some small rodents are supplied with ample spittle and wash themselves thoroughly if they are feeling too warm, the evaporation of the spittle providing them with sufficient cooling. Some other small animals are supplied with a specially structured tail which acts as a heat exchanger when positioned in a certain way and allows them to reduce body heat. The sweat glands of dogs and similar creatures are in the mouth, and the rapid exchange of air in panting provides them with sufficient evaporative cooling. Prehistoric animals, like the dimetrodon, were equipped with a sail-like structure on the back which served probably as a heat exchanger, acting in two ways: to remove body heat in hot weather and to gain solar heat in the cold. Some animals make the adjustment by reducing basal metabolism, while others immerse themselves in water or burrow into the cool ground. Birds lift their wings slightly. Whatever the means, the fact remains that there are limitations which generally restrict the species to a certain temperature zone. Man is virtually free of such restrictions, partly by reason of his ability to produce an artificial environment by clothing and shelter, but also because of his ability to resist a temperature rise by copious sweating and the consequent evaporative cooling. Not infrequently this copiousness may seem to be wasteful. But a considerable body of evidence exists to show that the few elements which do exist in the sweat are of importance to man, since his body is thereby washed with a slightly acid solution which serves to protect him against bacteria and fungi. Unevaporated sweat, which seems to be an overcompensation and a pure waste of body fluid, turns out to have a value of its own. In the one area of the body where the acid might be dangerous to himself, namely, in the forehead region, the sweat is prevented from running down into his eyes by the eyebrows.? http://custance.org/old/flood/5ch1.html You may find these sites interesting: This one is a great explanation of thermoregulation: ?Thermoregulation, or the maintenance of a fairly steady body temperature even under a variety of external conditions, is important to all animals because each species has a preferred body temperature at which functioning is optimal. These external conditions can include changes in temperature, vapor pressure, air velocity, and insulation among other factors that affect the temperature of the skin. Cold-blooded animals regulate their body temperature by selecting an appropriate external environment. Warm-blooded animals also rely on physiological mechanisms which can produce or dissipate heat? http://www.deas.harvard.edu/courses/es96/spring1997/web_page/health/thermreg.htm http://www.the-aps.org/publications/classics/mack.pdf http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/5/R1012 I hope this has answered your question .

Larger bucks of over 400 pounds have been recorded. The whitetails natural life span is 11-12 years, (17-20 years in captivity), but where hunted the average life span may be as low as 1½ years. The deer have large, conspicuous ears, a naked nose pad and long legs with hooves adapted for running. The sense of smell is so keen that deer rely on scent for just about everything from finding mates and food to detecting predators. Deer, under stress, emit an unfavorable odor, which can be picked up by other deer and acts as a warning of danger. The wet nose of the deer allows it to smell faint odors, as the odor particles stick to the moisture. A scent can be dispersed in many ways through glands, saliva and even urine, and the dense foliage of the forest and the cautious nature of the deer makes this a practical form of communication. Since the scent is dispersed throughout glands, the deer can stay alert while giving off a scent, and thus can evade a predator while warning other deer. Since the eyes are located on the side of the head, deer can view a wide range at once, and a deer can see 310 degrees around itself even when it appears to look straight ahead. Deer see best at night, as they have more light-detecting cells in their eyes than humans. Like most nocturnal animals, the eyes exhibit shining when exposed to harsh light at night, due to a reflection off a special membrane in the eye, called tapetum. Under strong light conditions of daylight, the deer's pupils contract in a narrow band, allowing the animal to focus on the entire horizon. Deer are also thought to be able to see in the ultraviolet light range of early AM, late afternoon and on overcast days. Although deer possess very good vision, they don't seem to trust this sense as much as smell, but they are masters at detecting very slight movement under the lowest of light conditions. Whitetails will even freeze and stomp a foot to try and instill movement in an object that they are unsure of. With eyes on the side of its head, deer cannot focus on one location with both eyes, making for very poor depth perception. Deer also see at a much lower resolution than humans and are thought to be colorblind. The whitetail's ears are critical to its survival, and they can easily detect a faint sound, and in a split second determine if danger is present. The ears contain many complex muscles, which allow free movement of the ears with incredible control. The deer's ears can rotate in any direction, allowing the animal to determine the direction of the sound. Hearing is so acute that the whitetail can detect the time it takes for a sound to reach one ear relative to the other; thus allowing the deer to establish how far away a sound is. If several deer are together, the ears can be a form of communication, and a simple flick of the ears can warn the others of danger. The main functions of the whitetail's coat are camouflage and thermoregulation. Deer blend in with the natural environment, and in order to help regulate the body temperature, deer grow different types of coats during the beginnings of winter and summer. This process, called molting, is triggered by hormonal changes brought about by the changing seasons. Summer coats have little bulk, and remain on the deer for about three months. By September, the summer pelage is faded gray, and new hairs are hollow, stiff and about 2 inches longer than normal. Soft hair lies against the skin and keeps the deer warm in the snow. During the rut, bucks develop darker facial hair, due to higher testosterone levels, signaling that they are ready to compete for does. Male deer, or bucks, have antlers, which are generally shed in January or February each year, and new ones are grown beginning in April or May. Antlers are live tissue, composed of bone, and they are the fastest growing tissue in the animal kingdom, growing at an average of 1-2 inches per week. During growth, antlers have a thin layer of \"velvet\" which is rubbed off after the antlers are fully grown. Both sexes have external glands, which secrete chemical scents called pheromones, and are used for identification of individual deer and for marking territories. The forehead gland (preorbital) is used only during the mating season for signposting, also referred to as \"buck rubs\" or \"rubs\". Since bucks and does remain apart for most of the year, signposting is used by the buck to let does know that he is ready to breed. The buck first licks branches above him and urinates on the ground, and then he returns to the site to see if any doe has responded by urinating in the same area. By smelling the urine, the buck can determine that the doe is approaching estrus. The nasal gland keeps the nose moist, and is thought to have other possible uses as well. The interdigital glands are located on the feet and, wherever the deer goes, a slight scent trail is deposited. Other deer read this as a sign that other deer have passed along safely. If there is danger, the metatarsel gland, located on the outside of the deer's hind foot, leaves a signal to other deer to flee the area. Evolution has given deer the amazing ability to impart important information through urine. The tarsel gland is located on the inside of the hind legs, and it is used to identify other deer, through a process called rub-urination. A deer will rub its two tarsel glands together while urinating over them, and thus leave important information about gender, social status and physical condition. Dominant bucks use rub-urination to establish rank in the herd, and they use rub-urinating more during rut than at other times of the year. Fawns are born spotted in late spring, but the spots are normally gone by fall, and adults are typically reddish tan in the summer and medium gray in the winter. The throat, stomach and inner legs are white all year-round, as is the underside of the 12-15 inch tail, which is usually raised and flared when deer are alarmed. The tail of the doe is more commonly waived in the air than that of the buck, perhaps as a way for young deer to see their mother and follow her away from danger, and this behavior causes some people to refer to these deer as \"fantails\" or \"flag tails\". All-black (melanistic) and all-white (albino) deer occur, but they are rare.

kinds of natural selection caused by predators, changing food supplies, etc. acts more or less equally on males and females but sexual selection acts primarily on the one sex that is competing for the other as we have seen, because of pregnancy and lactation, mammal females can have only a limited number of offspring, but males have no such limitations females can generally only conceive when they aren't pregnant or lactating, and even then only during a limited portion of their cycle males can mate any time so there are generally plenty of males around to mate when a female needs to but the males have to compete for access to those limited chances to father offspring so selection will favor any feature of the males that increases their success at mating with receptive females we tend to think of survival to adulthood as being the biggest factor in natural selection, hence the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" but in fact, sexual selection can exert a much stronger evolutionary effect than selection based on different rates of survival males who do not succeed at mating frequently may produce absolutely no offspring this means absolutely none of their genes go into the next generation -- very severe selection from an evolutionary point of view, leaving no offspring is equivalent to dying in infancy this is a common occurrence meanwhile, males who mate often may produce many, many offspring very rapidly increasing the representation of their traits in the next generation being successful at mating and having a large number of offspring has a far greater effect that just surviving and having an average number of offspring example: imagine a species in which 80% of the males produce no offspring, and the remaining 20% father the entire next generation these are realistic figures for many animals, from lions to baboons the effect of this difference in just one generation would be equivalent to a drought that killed off 8 out of 10 individuals that is, ordinary, common degrees of selection on sexual success have as much effect on the next generation as the most drastic, rare extremes of selection that affect survival the same is true even if many males leave just a few offspring, while a few males leave large numbers of offspring the contribution to the next generation by the father of 12 is bigger than that of ten fathers of one child each... so the traits that lead males to have many children are strongly selected for Point: the process that has the strongest, most consistent effect on evolution is not \"survival of the fittest\", but \"mating of the sexiest\" because sexual selection is so strong, it can favor traits that have significant costs for survival even if fewer of the individuals who have the trait survive, they produce so many more offspring than those without it that the trait is favored anyway classic example of sexual selection: peacock tails (on males) the showier the tail, the more successful the male is at mating the tails have gotten so big that they make it hard for the males to hide or get away from predators but the benefit in terms of success in mating outweighs the cost to survival intrasexual selection (male-male competition) in primates males try to keep other males away from females this ensures that they are the likely fathers of any offspring this results in hostile encounters or fights so sexual selection favors large body size, large canines, possibly other traits that help one male defeat another for access to females but females would not benefit as much from larger body size, canines, etc. they would just have to eat even more to maintain a large body when food is already their limiting factor in reproductive success since selection favors larger males but smaller females, eventually sexual dimorphism arises differences between males and females sure enough, those species with the greatest male-male competition have the greatest sexual dimorphism male-male competition is assumed to be greatest in species whose social groups have the greatest imbalance of females to males because if there are relatively few males in the group, mating with the many females, then there must be lots of males excluded from the group who are not mating at all these bachelor males must be constantly driven away by the few males in the group the evidence: in monogamous species there is very little male-male competition, since each male is paired with one female and indeed, monogamous species have almost no sexual dimorphism gibbons and siamangs are a

They are from the Camelid family. They are more docile/nicer than llamas. They s…pit, and gestation is about 12 months. ALPACA HABITAT Who could believe that the natural alpaca habitat is a harsh, unforgiving land? Alpacas come from the Altiplano region of the Andes Mountain in South America. Altiplano means high plain. Alpacas live at the 12,000 to 14,000 ft level. It is a very hard life for humans and animals alike. Vegetation is scarce, the air is thin, and the temperature can change by as much as forty degrees in one day. The vegetation that exists is mostly tough clumps of grass, Thola bushes, and occasionally clumps of Quenua trees. There are volcanos that have left volcanic flows. It rains, snows, has freezing temperatures, intense sunlight, and powerful winds. Pumas prey on altiplano livestock. Surviving in this harsh alpaca habitat meant an animal had to be hardy. After seven years of owning alpaca we have discovered how hardy these animals can be. They are stoic and they hardly ever get ill. Knowing the alpacas background of its original environment helps us to understand the alpaca and give better care for this wonderful animal. The alpacas padded feet are environmentally friendly. This adaptation was probably needed so they didn't destroy the scarce vegetable matter. Same is probably true for why they don't pull the grass out by its roots. If alpacas didn't have their dense fleece, they probably would not have survived the harsh winters on the altiplano. Alpacas can go days without water and food. Since there were times when food wasn't available, alpacas adapted to going without for awhile. With food scarcity, an alpacas fleece will grow less. An alpaca will borrow nutrients from other parts of its body to continue life. Keeping alpacas at their optimal weight means your fleece will be denser and grow better. Alpacas actually need less feed than most other animals. It only takes 1.5 to 2% of an alpacas body weight of feed to sustain a healthy alpaca. The alpacas three-compartment stomach converts grass and hay to energy with extreme efficiency so they eat less. The harsh conditions they live in on the altiplano makes this survival adaptation a necessity. Alpacas don't drink a lot of water. This is another adaptation of the unforgiving altiplano. Clean water should always be available for your alpacas, though. Alpacas go without food and water in their natural alpaca habitat, but doing so stresses an alpaca. When alpacas fear for their survival they will abort babies. Keep your alpacas free of stress by making sure that each alpaca is able to feed freely and have plenty of water and you will have less cria losses. An alpaca is really a very fast animal. Probably developed to survive escape of the Puma. Not giving an alpaca enough room to exercise keeps them from doing what comes natural to an alpaca and could be another source of stress. Keep them in large enough pastures where they can run. Knowing the natural alpaca habitat can help you understand your alpaca and provide for their needs. A lot is still not known about alpacas, but the industry has made huge steps in learning about caring for alpacas. an alpaca is a smaller version of a llama. Llamas are used for packing and you can ride them while alpacas do not have the strength to do either of those things. They are mainly used for the fur or as we call it fleece or fiber. ~EDIT~ An alpaca is an animal from the Camelid group. They are closely related to the llama, which they seem like a smaller version of, but they are also close relatives of camels.
