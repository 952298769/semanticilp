Their bodies are designed to easily adapt to the water. They have feathers that help them to move but also to keep the water from reaching their body. This is important as they have to keep their body temperature regulated. It is also helpful because it seems that the colder the water happens to be, the more their main food sources will be found in it. Penguins use what they have readily available on land too. For example they may use grass, rocks, sticks, and other debris to build nests and burrows. This is where they will lay their eggs as well as care for their young when they are born until they can go to the water to hunt for food on their own.",1.0394455194473267],["The whales remain in the lagoons for 2-3 months, allowing the calves to build up a thick layer of blubber to sustain them during the northward migration and keep them warm in the colder waters.",1.0311893224716187]]
