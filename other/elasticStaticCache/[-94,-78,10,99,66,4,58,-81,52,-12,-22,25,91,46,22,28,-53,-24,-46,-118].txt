[["1850 s Austrian Monk who taught mathematics during the peak of Darwin s Natural Selection positive evolutionary traits are selected over time Natural Selection did not fit with the prevailing view of inheritance The Blending Hypothesis was the existing theory of Mendel's time inheritable traits were blended from the parents a black horse and a white horse would produce a gray horse blending would not promote evolution Mendel conducted experiments with peas to observe heritable traits He chose peas because: peas can self fertilize he had true-breeding varieties peas can also be cross-fertilized Mendel believed that: A. discrete units of inheritance existed we now call these genes B. offspring inherited a unit for each trait from each parent C. different units assemble independently in the gametes Gregor Mendel is considered to be the Father of Genetics II.",1.1134096384048462],["Specifically: it shows why variation does not get blended away after a few generations that is, why individuals keep coming out different every generation, rather than all getting blended to the same average of traits because inheritance works by reshuffling, not blending it also shows how these traits get randomly mixed up to produce many different combinations every generation so selection has a wide variety of combinations to act on not necessarily limited to the combinations that the parents had next time, we will see that a simple extension of this model also explains two other features of inheritance that are required for Darwin's theory to work: how variation is maintained for \"continuous\" traits, like body size and how some offspring can have characteristics more extreme than their parents like a 6 foot tall son of two parents who were both only 5 foot 8 inches tall and finally, next time we will also see how Mendel's theory of inheritance lends itself to a simple explanation of where completely new variants come from Mendel's model of inheritance also allows us to explain some less obvious processes in evolution, which we will get to in future sessions... Mendel's work, originally published in 1866, was noticed again around 1900, over 30 years later it was accepted this time because a physical mechanism had been observed that showed how Mendel's model could work that is, the general nature of chromosomes had been observed We will skip the interesting process by which this was figured out, and go straight to the results Cell division organisms begin as a single cell produced by the fusion of an egg and a sperm that then divides repeatedly to create the multi-celled organism this normal form of cell division is called mitosis in the course of cell division, structures called chromosomes condense out of the material inside the cell as you no doubt already know, these chromosomes are the structures that actually contain the genes and the genes, as we will see next time, are actually portions of long molecules of DNA the chromosomes are not normally visible;",1.0529723167419434],["In the present context, this may be viewed as the

, which is the first cell of an embryo of a new organism each gamete contributes one chromosome towards each pair in the zygote, creating a new diploid cell the result of this process is that of each chromosome pair in the zygote, one chromosome comes from the mother, and one from the father this zygote has a new combination of genes, half from the mother, half from the father, and is not identical to either one of them this creates new combinations of traits in every offspring, giving selection a nearly endless supply of variation to act upon Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes by watching cells divide under a microscope, we can see that they do, indeed, assort independently in meiosis, just like Mendel's particles of inheritance yet there are obviously more than 23 traits that are reshuffled in human reproduction So, if the genes are on the chromosomes, somehow genes from the same chromosome must be getting separated and recombined into new combinations that is, if the genes stayed on the same chromosome, the genes on a given chromosome would always occur in the same combinations, rather than assorting independently Say the gene for seed color (Y or y) were on the same chromosome as the gene for seed smoothness (S or s) A plant that was YySs might have one chromosome that was YS and the other that was ys then it could only produce gametes that had YS or ys it could never produce a Ys or a yS gamete yet we know that many, many traits do assort independently that is, gametes are produced with all the possible combinations of alleles Some mechanism must allow for genes on the same chromosome to get split up into the gametes as if they were on different chromosomes The mechanism that allows this to happen is called crossing over To understand this, let's first summarize the modern view of chromosomes and genes: genes (or loci) are arranged along the length of chromosomes actually, along a single strand of DNA which is densely coiled and tangled to form the visible chromosome if we look at genes on different chromosomes, they nicely follow Mendel's second law they segregate completely independently but if we consider genes on the same chromosome, many do not follow Mendel's law very well some are almost always inherited together others segregate fairly independently, but not as fully as Mendel predicted that is, not all combinations of the traits are equally common in the gametes the combinations of traits found in the parent are more common in the gametes than would be predicted by random, independent assortment crossing over in the process of meiosis (production of gametes) the homologous chromosomes line up next to each other, and the strands frequently break and fuse back together frequently, the ends get swapped before they fuse back this produces two chromosomes that are new combinations of parts of the original ones the more distance separating the genes on a chromosome, the more likely it is that the break in crossing-over will occur between them and \"unlink\" them tightly linked traits are located close together on the chromosome so they tend to be inherited in the same combinations as were found in the parents less linked (or fully independent) traits are located farther apart they assort almost or fully independently, as Mendel predicted With both independent assortment of whole chromosomes, and crossing over that swaps batches of genes between chromosomes, the genes get almost completely randomly divided \nup into the gametes so the gametes that each parent produces each contain an almost random selection of half the genes of that parent when the parents mate, a zygote is produced by the fusion of an egg and a sperm selected almost at random from all the gametes they have produced the result is a new individual with an almost random combination of genes the whole of these processes that produce new, random combinations of genes is called recombination The point of all this: we can observe the physical process in which alleles get shuffled (almost) randomly into gametes, just as Mendel inferred given a very large number of loci, each with multiple alleles, this provides an effectively endless variety of combinations of alleles in the offspring which gives selection the variation in phenotypes it needs to work and, since the genes are discrete units, rather than a substance that blends, it explains why the variation does not blend away over time This is all very well for either-or traits, like yellow vs. green seeds.",0.942399799823761],["His theory was

Behavior Is Its Survival Value Evolutionary analysis of how behavior helps an animal or its offspring stay alive Example: Tinbergen`s gull experiments fig 55.1 Gull parents remove hatched eggshells from nest If broken shells replaced, predation increased White shell interior cues predators Shell removal behavior is adaptive Behavioral Ecology Study of how natural selection shapes behavior Adaptive significance: how behavior increases survival and reproduction Concentration of early studies Habitat selection Avoiding predation Becoming more effective predator Recent studies examine animal`s fitness or reproductive success How behavior is related to fitness = study of adaptation itself Natural selection acts on genetic component of behavioral differences Behavior favoring reproductive success becomes more prevalent over time Test hypothesis by measuring fitness, demonstrating its correlation with behavior May also measure other factors associated with reproduction FORAGING BEHAVIOR Feeding Is One of Most Basic Animal Behaviors Foraging behavior: involved with selection and collection of food Predators may actively hunt, ambush or trap prey fig 55.2 Specialists Versus Generalists Specialists: feed on only one kind of food Example: some ants eat only spider eggs Example: oystercatchers feed on only mussels fig 55.3 Generalists: feed on many different kinds of food Not as efficient as specialists at catching any one kind of food Take advantage of catching many different varieties Behavior is obviously important to growth and reproduction Target of strong evolutionary forces Expect evolution to favor foraging efficiency Calculate net energy of different prey items, size and energy needed for pursuit Predictions made by optimal foraging theory fig 55.4 Animals cannot always maximize energy intake Nutrition and variety of food must be considered Compromises made because of predation by others fig 55.5 SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Definition of Social Behavior Interaction with others of same or different species May be competitive or cooperative Territorial Behavior Home range: daily activity site May overlap with others in time or space May be exclusive and actively defended Territoriality fig 55.6 Individual exclusively uses area with some limited resource Resources may include food or potential mates Defense of area via displays or overt aggression Economic risks of territorial behavior Energy costs versus energy benefits Example: flowers and nectar-feeding birds fig 55.7 If flowers scarce, not worth defending since they do not provide enough energy If abundant, not worth defending, easy to get enough energy Defense practical for intermediate quantity of flowers The Ecology of Reproduction Reproductive strategies: behaviors that maximize reproductive success Include mate choice, number of mates and parental care Evolved in response to ecology, food resources, nest sites, distribution of potential mates Mate choice first observed by Darwin fig 55.8 Female`s evaluate male`s quality, decide whether or not to mate Superior mates should leave more offspring Parental investment and mate choice Contributions of each parent to raising offspring Estimate energy spent by male and female in offspring care Parent with the greatest cost should make choice for mate Generally female, may be male Depends on cost of parental care Fundamental differences between males and females Size of gametes: egg significantly larger than sperm Nutritional value of gametes: egg more than sperm Care costly to females that gestate and lactate Some males increase cost by collecting food, defending and feeding young Males may show mate choice if they have high parental investment Example: male cricket spermatophore = 30% of body weight Females compete for males Males choose large females to produce more offspring fig 55.9 Reproductive competition and sexual selection Reproductive competition: competitive interactions over access to mates Females frequently mate with largest male May be associated with competition between other males fig 55.10 Few males in population may sire most \nof offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define \"individual\" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by \"queen substance\", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed offspring, watch for predators, defend territory Can reproduce but do not for a period of time Nest with helpers have more offspring tbl 55.1 Helpers are often fledged offspring of those they help Resembles family situation Evolution explained by inclusive fitness concept Vertebrate Alarm Calling Activity of certain individuals benefit group at expense to individual Example: meerkats fig 55.5 Individuals act as sentries for group May give alarm call when predator sighted Draws attention to itself to protect others Behavior seems contrary to own self interest Example: Belding`s ground squirrels Colonies female-based, \nmales not related to any females Females with relatives nearby more likely to sound alarm than females with no kin nearby Alarm calling favors nepotism Socioecology Vertebrate societies have characteristic organization fig 55.22 Examines influence of environment on social organization Factors include food type and predation Example: African weaver birds Forest species fig 55.23a Builds camouflaged solitary nest Monogamous mating Eat insects Savanna species fig 55.23b Nest in colonies in trees Polygynous mating Eat seeds Feeding and nesting depend on area ecology Mating form dependent on feeding and expense of being a parent Sociality in African ungulates correlate with diet HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY Theories of Animal Sociobiology and Human Applications Could readily examine human activities Exhibit kin-selected altruism and reciprocity Show extensive parental care of offspring Possess variety of mating systems Exhibit unevolutionary behaviors like adoption Two Processes Led to Adaptive Change in Human Evolution Biological evolution Primate heritage shared with chimpanzees Include kin-selected and reciprocal altruism Traits are definitely adaptive in non-human primates Cultural evolution Transfer of information needed for survival Nongenetic mode of adaptation Passed from generation to generation by tradition Includes use of tools, shelter construction, marriage practices Difficult to identify biological components of human behavior Study cross-cultural traits May have been affected by natural selection May result from genes fixed in human populations Examples: Most mammals and human species are polygamous Many cultures exhibit same greeting pattern Many biologists resist explaining human behavior in evolutionary terms Has been used in past to support racist, fascist, sexist policies Potential for abuse still exists If behaviors are \"hardwired\" negative behaviors like violence and aggression cannot easily be changed Human behavior is affected by innate

of individuals within a population New variants of genes are continually being added to populations through the random process of mutation The recombination of genes increases the variation initially produced by mutation The shuffling of genes during formation of sperm and ova results in an almost infinite variety of possible gene combinations in a population Because of the particulate nature of inheritance, no loss of variation occurs from one generation to the next Each generation of each population has an enormous store of genetic variation on which natural selection can act Selection reduces the genetic variation produced by mutation The fittest individuals are defined as those who leave the most surviving offspring to mature and reproduce These individuals thereby contribute the most genes to the next generation, and thus over time their genes become most common in the gene pool of the population New mutations, new combinations of genes, and constantly changing environments continually produce some individuals that are better adapted than others Natural selection favors these individuals and selects out individuals with less fit genotypes Gradually, the population evolves through the differential perpetuation of genes of the fittest individuals Definitions A gene is the sequence of DNA coding for a specific protein product or controlling the action of such a sequence The genotype is the pair of genes that an individual possesses coding for a particular protein The phenotype is the observable expression of the genotype Fitness is a measure of the relative reproductive success of individuals based on their genotypes, comprising two components Survival from conception at least to sexual maturity Fertility, the production of offspring Inclusive Fitness is the relative success at leaving genes in the next or subsequent generations, based on an individual&#146;s own reproductive success plus the success of relatives that carry the same genes Explicitly counts contributions of relatives The closer the relative, the greater the contribution Calculation of the Coefficient of Relationship The complicated calculus of inclusive fitness suggests that behavior that would sacrifice the reproductive success of an individual (altruism) would be selectively favored if the behavior increased the reproductive success of more than two sibs or more than eight first cousins Sexual Selection is natural selection on traits related to obtaining mates for sexual reproduction Ability to compete with members of the same sex for a mate Increased body size, strength Attraction between the sexes Large breasts, penis Parental Investment is any behavior toward offspring that increases the chances of the offspring&#146;s survival at the cost of the parent&#146;s ability to invest in future offspring Expect to differ by sex For mammals, females generally have much greater parental investment per offspring Sociality Social Groups Benefits: Predator protection Find mates Primates require social contact Costs Competition for resources, mates Disease transmission Evolutionary Environment of Adaptation Early Hominid Groups Evolutionary Environment of Adaptation (Paleolithic) Average group/community size probably around 30 individuals Foraging/hunting evolving into gathering/ hunting Natural vs. Cultural Selection Natural vs. Cultural Selection Most dramatic rate of change documented in man: Hb S going from 0.00 to 0.20 in around 2,000 years (100 generations) Hunter-gatherers can make the change to post-modern, post-industrial lifestyle in one generation Cultural selection does not depend on the relatively slow process of differential reproduction An Example of Selection Sickle Cell Anemia and Malaria Mutation from Hb A to Hb S occurred in at least two Western African populations From DNA data on non-coding regions in the hemoglobin genes we know of a Benin variety and a Senegal variety of HbS These initial mutations increased in frequency in these areas and were transmitted to neighboring areas by gene flow and population movement Distribution of the Sickle Cell Allele in Africa Benin group Kwa speaking yam cultivators shifted from hunting and gathering 2,000 years ago and spread across much of the current yam zone Senegal group Rice cultivation spread into the area almost 2,700 years ago from the region of the Gambia river As agriculture spread, the forest was increasingly cleared and malaria spread, increasing the fitness of individuals with HbS genes With mosquito abatement, malaria rates decline and selection favoring the sickle cell heterozygote decreases Incest taboo Sociobiological claims Arguably universal, therefore likely gene-based Natural selection based on deleterious effects of inbreeding Increased homozygosity results in the increased occurrence of homozygous recessive negative characteristics (PKU, sickle cell) Increased homozygosity arguable limits genetic variability available for adaptation to changing environments Universality is arguable, with notable exceptions in China, Inca, Egypt, Hawaii, 19th century Mormons in Utah, Roman Egyptians The latter two are not cases of &quot;royal family&quot; incest, involving the institutional acceptance of incest between commoners as well as leaders Homozygous negative traits Deleterious negative \nmutations are extremely difficult for selection to eliminate because they &quot;hide&quot; in heterozygotes Natural selection will more efficiently remove them from the population under conditions of incest Evidence of harm is extremely weak, and there is substantial counter-evidence Reduced genetic variability Incest increases homozygosity and decreases the frequency of the heterozygous genotypes It doesn&#146;t reduce the overall genetic variability in the population Selection depends on the array of alleles available to the population, not frequencies of genotypes The Yanomamo have strict parent-offspring and sibling incest taboo These include classificatory kin In spite of these taboos, on the basis of extensive genealogies, Neel calculated that two individuals picked at random from a village share as many genes as full siblings Builds up over the generations based on village fission patterns and mate exchange Infanticide One of the most widely accepted sociobiological explanations in anthropology is the explanation of infanticide It is widely claimed that selective infant killing is found in most primates and that it has played an important role in the evolution of primate social organization The argument comes initially from Hrdy&#146;s attempt to explain high infant mortality rates in unimale Hanuman langurs troops she was observing in India in the mid-1970s Infant deaths appeared to peak near times of a new male affiliating with the stable female troop core Hrdy argued that the new males were killing the infants of the previous male in an attempt to maximize their own reproductive success Increases male fitness by reducing competitors offspring and removing nursing infants from mothers so they will resume estrus cycling more rapidly Practice is deleterious to female reproductive success Hrdy models that infanticide is a viable reproductive strategy when: Population densities are high, making more male competitors available Males have a short tenure with troop, limiting reproductive opportunities Breeding is not highly seasonal so a mother losing an infant rapidly comes into estrus Knowledge of the paternity of both killed infants and subsequent births is essential, but infanticidal males can be documented as siring subsequent births for only 8 of 48 reported cases In two of these cases, the male killed his own offspring Only 13% of reported cases of infanticide appear to support the sociological explanation Infanticide does not always follow takeovers by new males The well-documented occasions of infanticide occur in a variety of contexts, including aggressive inter-group interactions and male-band/troop interactions Social interactions are highly variable In unimale troops, aggressive behavior should be selected for among males since only the aggressive successfully takeover a troop, whether they practice infanticide or not Infanticide may occur as an indirect effect of

natural selection Waited for 20 years to publish-contacted by Alfred Wallace in 1858, who had independently come to the same conclusions Basis of theory limited food and space variety within a species (variations are inherited and passed on) success of some individuals due to individual variation, some are more successful than others at leaving offspring Darwinian \"fitness\" or success is limited to production of offspring Inheritance of successful traits successful organisms have inherited traits that help them survive traits carried by individuals that produce no offspring will die out natural selection environment determines which individuals are most successful and will reproduce Artificial selection goes on all the time Nature selects for or against traits Populations change with time Changes in population are shaped by natural selection over time a population changes to the point that it is a different species Definitions Population=individuals of the same species in a defined area Species=actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations (production of viable offspring) Evolution=genetic changes with time Populations evolve, individuals do not Individual's genetic composition is set at conception Genes, located on chromosomes code for various traits Genes exist in two or more forms called alleles Genotype=genetic makeup Phenotype=physical appearance Variability (or genetic diversity) is critical Problems with lack of variabiliy (disease can wipe out populations without enough variable resistance) Variability can be effected by factors that produce new alleles mutations-occur randomly-some good-most bad-may be selected for or against resuffling of existing alleles recombination offspring differ from parents through random recombination of alleles random combinations may make individuals more or less fit (or have no effect) increases variability genetic drift separation of populations smaller group=less \nvariability interbreeding causes more homogeneous populations e.g. reproductive isolation of european royal families resulted in expression of hemophilia migration introduction of new individuals into populations exit of existing members of population the impact varies depending on the size of the population selection pressures anything that systematically alters the genotypes of a population in natural selection, nature does the selecting in artificial selection humans do the selection selection is based on phenotypic characteristics examples peppered moth cows grazing in pasture Evidence for Evolution Evidence from Fossil Record shows what extinct life forms looked like gaps occur in fossil record newer layers of rock (and fossils) are deposited on older layers show that different organisms lived at different times organisms from the past are different than those today fossils found close to each other are similar (those distant from each other are more different) sometimes intermediate forms are found generally, older rocks have more simple fossils than more recent Evidence from Comparative Anatomy natural selection can only use existing structures and gradually modify them homologous structures-related structures in related organisms e.g. forelimbs of mammals same bones exist but forms change man to bat to whale vestigal organs-basic organs with no apparent use in the current form, but string resemblance to ancestral forms humans retain vertebrae that wiggle tails whales retain hipbones Evidence from Embryology embryos of many organisms are very similar human embryos pass through stage with gill slits and tails Evidence from Biochemistry All living organisms use DNA and the same amino acids Patterns of Evolution Gradual change populations change slowly over many years, gradually producing new species Divergent evolution single populations split and differences gradually accumulate Adaptive radiation simultaneous divergent evolution Convergent evolution dissimilar or distantly related organisms begin to look alike (whales and porpoises look like fish) Rates of Evolution Phyletic gradualism divided populations change at about the same gradual rate Punctuated equilibrium gradual changes should result in lots of intermediate forms intermediates can be hard to find Gould and Eldredge proposed mechanism by which little change over long period of time large changes occur in short period of time (accounting for scarcity of intermediate forms)",0.8209086656570435],["Novartis seeds has produced several corn varieties that have been modified to provide
