You see tadpole, froglet, eggs and adult frog. What do you think happens first? Right—the eggs. Now you are going to take turns coming up and choosing the next stage until the cycle is complete. Some of you may choose to hold up a picture of the correct stage when it is your turn, then I will drag the right picture down. What are the stages? What happens between the tadpole stage and the adult stage?",1.5773206949234009],["DESCRIPTION: Students will observe the life cycle of the frog in a classroom frog aquarium from egg to adult frog.",1.5727380514144897],["68 Amphibians Ectotherms Ectotherms Most are frogs or salamanders Most are frogs or salamanders Skin is thin, smooth, and moist Skin is thin, smooth, and moist Double-Life Double-Life –Lay eggs without shells in a wet environment –Tadpoles can only live in water –Later they develop into land dwellers",1.5713571310043335],["68 Amphibians Ectotherms Ectotherms Most are frogs or salamanders Most are frogs or salamanders Skin is thin, smooth, and moist Skin is thin, smooth, and moist Double-Life Double-Life –Lay eggs without shells in a wet environment –Tadpoles can only live in water –Later they develop into land dwellers",1.5713571310043335],["The frog's tail will eventually disappear completely and it will start to eat insects instead of plants from the water.

In this species, whose life history has been painstakingly documented, both male and female parents are involved in caring for the egg and tadpole. The male guards the egg for ten to twelve days. Once the eggs hatch into tadpoles, the female takes over, trans­porting each tadpole to a bromeliad containing water. Each tadpole is placed in a different bromeliad, and the female returns regularly to deposit an unfer­tilized egg that serves as food for the developing frog (Duellman 1992).",1.5646295547485352],["Once the tadpole has completely made all of its changes through metamorphosis, the animal begins a life on land and in the water as an adult frog and the cycle begins once again.",1.5591034889221191],["___________ In Greek, the, word amphibios means \"living a double life. Most members of the class Amphibia exhibit a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial adaptations. Most species are tied to water because their eggs, lacking shells, dry out quickly in the air; The frog in Figure 17.33 spends much of its time on land, but it lays its eggs in water. An egg develops into a larva called a tadpole, a legless, aquatic algae-eater with gills, a lateral line system resembling that of fishes, and a long finned tail. In changing into a frog, the tadpole undergoes a radical metamorphosis. When a young frog crawls onto shore and begins life as a terrestrial insect -eater, it has four legs, air-breathing lungs instead of gills, a pair of external eardrums, and no lateral line system. Because of metamorphosis, many amphibians truly live a double life. But even as adults, amphibians are most abundant in damp habitats, such as swamps and rain forests. This is partly because amphibians depend on their moist skin to supplement lung function in exchanging gases with the environment. Thus, even those frogs that are adapted to relatively dry habitats spend much of their time in humid burrows or under piles of moist leaves. The amphibians of today, including frogs and salamanders, account for only about 8% of all living vertebrates, or about 4,000 species.",1.55845046043396],["An animal in an early stage of development that differs greatly in appearance from its adult stage.
