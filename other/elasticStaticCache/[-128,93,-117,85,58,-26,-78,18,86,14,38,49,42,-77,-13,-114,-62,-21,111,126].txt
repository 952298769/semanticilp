The \"original\" Ragdoll cat is a large, sweet-natured cat with a variety of myths surrounding its origins. The commonest is that Ragdolls are the result of a female cat which had been hit by a car and whose subsequent litters of kittens were very placid. This is the Lamarckian idea of inheritance - a trait acquired by the parent could be inherited by the offspring. If Lamarck's theory had been correct, many dogs would be born tail-less due to generations of tail-docking. With the car accident tale dismissed by most people, the breeder claimed that the founding mother of her Ragdoll breed had been infused with skunk genes (and even with human genes!) while being treated for her injuries. It was, apparently, some secret experiment. The wonderful thing about conspiracy theories is that people want to believe them and it is incredibly hard to dent their belief because \"it's all part of a big cover up\". Even if the female cat had been infused with skunk genes, those genes could not have been passed on to her offspring because they would not have entered the germ cells (the unripened egg cells in the ovaries). The cat's immune system would have reacted to the injection of foreign material; just as it would to a vaccination or a transfusion of mismatched blood. Some of the colourways of Ragdoll-derivative cats have been seen as evidence of skunk genes rather. They are due to the well-documented \"white spotting\" gene which has been seen in cats for decades.
