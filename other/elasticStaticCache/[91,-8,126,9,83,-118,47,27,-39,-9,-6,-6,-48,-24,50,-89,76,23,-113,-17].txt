rose early today He helped trees grow Melted bitter snow Tomorrow he will rise in another ceremonious play The sun went down furiously in a stunning sunset With purples and blues Then moon appeared

waves into the cove fog pours more secrets cutting out the world sounds of the sea fog erasing the land the ocean sends a blanket of fog neighbors leaving as fog frost frost dropping a basket with 12

sky cold high winds blow from a bright hole waning moon watches a pie put out to cool eaten away dark night winds blowing over the seas the moon sinks in the full moon slips into its silver path sea sleep melting into the sea the full moon leaves a candle bright plunging right in the moon and I cold night seas time on a moonless night a dog barking released from snow-capped peaks a full moon cold winds rounding snow-capped peaks a full moon from the full moon cold summit winds snow-clad touching eyes the whiteness of snow a full moon winter moon directing the winds around corners winter's new moon the cutting cold shines tonight high on a cliff the quarter moon finds dark houses wolf moon slipping into northern pines winter moonlight winter moonlight the crystal prism turns with the tides surf and sea white with the sound of moonlight morning mornings the winter moon leaves a frosted path night cold night I feed brownies to aching bones knocking cold comes in unasked the night house winter nights enough warmth to answer letters night breaking waves rocks silence in a dark night an ill-made shape night the animal that keeps death in a little space prowls to the left night overtaking the blackness of molten rock night - the longest longest night full moon whitens pure snow Northern Lights Northern Lights a white robed choir sings to radio static rain rattle of rain across the valley into my hand downpour a basket on the porch fills with rain raindrops inside heartbeats after dinner so full of soup it begins to rain sky to the rocks the sky falling free a bluish glow pale skies winter comes from afar a white foam wave smoke blind smoke touching the sky with one finger wood smoke pressed to the porch by low clouds snowflakes life of a snowflake falling Mono Lake on salt-crystal pillars snowflakes snowing silence snowing light satisfied with toast and cocoa it stops snowing porch light brilliant with the points of falling snow night light snow falls on the porch rain silent snow the clock ticks back and forth snowfall first snow deep as a fallen leaf upright mountain deep a sky covering with snow our way home blue cold snow warmed by fallen leaves russet brown ticking each hour snow deepens early snow even in the hole is white overturned outhouse snow - blowing the world wobbles the weight of snow drifting no trespassing yet thru the split rail fence snow goes to touch stars her outstretched hand fills with snowflakes snowdrifts flinging moth wings across the land snow - melting melting snow your tracks leaving a dampness melting snow \nthe white nets hold down springing grasses it melts last light of afternoon rest of the snow cap of snow on the sun-warmed rock shrinking to fit snow - new new-fallen snow scraped by wing tips leaving the earth new-fallen snow screams of children biting cold snow - predicted snow predicted a jar of old buttons in the top drawer snow - viewing giant snowflakes bring to the window adult faces stars crystals filling the night window with stars glistening cold the stars bend down a few flakes snow taste the cold fire of frozen stars high winds stars moved about by swaying tress cold stars dropping into the ocean snowflakes winter stars pea soup doesn't taste without salt the first stars a farmhouse and a buoy before one star beams from the lighthouse search the sky into the sky notes from the harp light stars earth lines starpaths light the fluid landscape in our blood bright crystals star journeys waves in and out of the sea stars storm curving the sky storm clouds arch into the bay the winter tempest visiting the neighbors how still it is winter storms passing the rain rattle drums on the roof sea storm blue black clouds sink salt-water air after the snowstorm new paths to old places the skies clear fire on water reflecting the sun after a storm between winter storms a fisherman come to bring poems and primroses after the snowstorm only wood smoke drifts into the clearing snow storm brings white skies down to earth this blizzard blowing about one small candle snow storm children hanging in a tree paper flowers storm winds in all things that don't die this quivering winter storm tearing the waves white low-scudding clouds storm winds breeze through a cracked window our nightly breath storm waves winter tides wave to mountain tops storm clouds forcing the sun to set far out to sea night storm at sea dark things move closer winter storms wrapping around the house the ocean's roar storm sails cloud evening skies eyes sun in winter winter sun coming in late for

dark places in cliffs for the night sea winds not believing in the silence wind from the mouth of something dark a blanket of wind wrapping around the house ocean cold sea foam pulling storm winds
