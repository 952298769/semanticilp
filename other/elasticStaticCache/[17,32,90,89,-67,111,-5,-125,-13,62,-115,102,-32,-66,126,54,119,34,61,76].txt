condensation, precipitation, evaporation) but the amount of water stays the same (3) Knows that clouds and fog are made of tiny droplets of water (3) Knows that night and day are caused by the Earth&#146;s rotation on its axis (3) Knows the major differences between fresh water and ocean water (3) Level III Knows that the Earth is the only body in our solar system that appears able to support life (5) Knows that the Earth is comprised of layers including a core, mantle, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere (7) Knows the composition and structure of the Earth&#146;s atmosphere (e.g., temperature and pressure in different layers of the atmosphere, circulation of air masses) (7) Knows ways in which clouds affect weather and climate (e.g., precipitation, reflection of light from the Sun, retention of heat energy emitted from the Earth&#146;s surface, the effects of volcanos and other catastrophic events) (7) Knows the properties that make water an essential component of the Earth system (e.g., its ability to act as a solvent, its ability to remain a liquid at most Earth temperatures) (7) Knows that the Sun is the principle energy source for phenomena on the Earth&#146;s surface (e.g., winds, ocean currents, the water cycle, plant growth) (6) Knows how the tilt of the Earth&#146;s axis and the Earth&#146;s revolution around the Sun affects seasons and weather patterns (i.e., heat falls more intensely on one part or another of the Earth&#146;s surface during its revolution around the Sun) (7) Knows the processes involved in the water cycle (e.g., evaporation, condensation, precipitation, surface run-off, infiltration and their effects on climactic patterns) (7) Level IV Knows factors that can impact the Earth&#146;s climate (e.g., changes in the composition of the atmosphere;",0.607833981513977],["Maui : Maui has fairly consistent weather throughout the year, with a summer (May through October) and winter season (November through April)
