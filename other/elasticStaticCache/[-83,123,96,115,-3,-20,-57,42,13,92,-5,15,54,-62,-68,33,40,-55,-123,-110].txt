Today Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian genetics provide the foundations of modern evolutionary theory in biology Several definitions: Species: able to interbreed and produce viable offspring Race (problematic term), subgroups within a species that can interbreed but seldom do Clinal variation: systematic gradient in gene frequencies over space - Divergent evolution: Mother population gives rise to two daughter populations - Linear evolution: speciation along linear (time) trajectory (transformation) - Convergent evolution: two different species independently develop similar characteristics (e.g., wings, fins) Cultural Evolution Cultural evolution emphasizes the systematic change of cultural systems through time: virtually all scientific archaeologists are evolutionists of one form or another, but differ widely on what definition of evolution they use Cultural historical views tend to focus on phylogenetic view, whereas processualists, promoting the view that culture is the means through which humans adapt to their environments tend to view cultural evolution as a process that follows patterns of biological evolution: they use a natural science model But, do
