ECHINODERMATA: THE ECHINODERMS General Ecology of Echinoderms Ancient group of marine animals, well-represented in fossil record Name means \"spiny skin\" fig 41.33 Examples: sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers Basic Features of Echinoderms Have epidermis stretched over an internal skeleton Endoskeleton composed of ossicles: movable or fixed calcium plates Plates enclosed within living tissue when first formed Bear spines as indicated by phylum`s name Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple but complete: mouth, gut and anus Capable of extensive regeneration Some animals may drop parts when attacked May reproduce asexually by splitting into parts Sexual reproduction and fertilization is external Sexes are separate, but difficult to distinguish externally Develop into free-swimming, bilaterally symmetrical larvae fig 41.35 Significantly different from annelid/mollusk trochophore larvae Larvae possess bands of cilia, used for locomotion Diversity of Echinoderms Class Crinoidea: the sea lilies and feather stars fig

calcareous plates Walk along substrate with tube feet or movement of spines Feed on algae, debris scraped off the surfaces by triangular teeth Reproduction similar to other echinoderms Larvae have long arms, unlike those of other classes Class Holothuroidea: the sea cucumbers fig 41.33b Soft, sluglike organisms with tough, leathery outer skin Most lie on sides at the bottom of the ocean Mouth is located on one end Surrounded by tube feet modified into tentacles Tentacles secrete mucus to trap food particles Calcareous skeleton reduced to widely separated, microscopic plates Have highly branched respiratory trees that originate from cloaca Water brought into and out of cloaca by muscular contractions Gas exchange occurs across the respiratory trees Have tube feet on body, may be
