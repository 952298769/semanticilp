ocean crust is destroyed at subduction zones 3) the process is driven by mantle convection currents *** seafloor spreading is the most conclusive evidence for continental drift 11 CHAPTER 19 PLATE

towing of magnetometers 13 CHAPTER 19 PLATE TECTONICS PLATE TECTONICS Geomagnetic Reversals The pattern of magnetic anomalies on the seafloor revealed the following (Vines and Matthews, 1963) 1) zebra

system ** a map showing earthquake distribution would clearly define plate boundaries 23 CHAPTER 19 PLATE TECTONICS PLATE TECTONICS II) Distribution of Shallow, Intermediate and Deep Focus Earthquakes - shallow-focus earthquakes (&lt;70 km) due to the interaction of cold dense slabs of oceanic crust with the overriding lithosphere - intermediate-focus earthquakes (70-300 km) generated similar to shallow-focus earthquakes - deep-focus earthquakes (&gt;300 km) due to mineral phase transformation (olivine-spinel) which produces &quot;brittle&quot; response to stresses 24 CHAPTER 19 PLATE TECTONICS PLATE TECTONICS III) Evidence for the Age of the Sea Floor - evidence from ocean drilling by Glomar Challenger and Joides Resolution (sediments and rocks of the ocean floor) 1) age of the sea-floor sediment increased with increasing distance from the ridge - confirmed the prediction that the youngest oceanic crust is to be found at the ridge and the oldest flanking continental margins 25 CHAPTER 19 PLATE TECTONICS PLATE TECTONICS III) Evidence for the Age of the Sea Floor 2) rate of sea-floor spreading calculated was in agreement with that determined using magnetic evidence 3) the ocean basins were young (age &lt;200 MA) compared to the continents 4) absence of sediments on the ridge crest and increasing sediment thickness with increasing distance from the ridge 26 CHAPTER 19
