have occurred in two ways Suturing of individual proto-continents through random collisions Peripheral accretion of newly-formed sialic material The actual enlargement is probably a combination of both processes Let's talk &quot;peripheral accretion&quot; - Platform Sequences and Geosynclinal Belts The continental cratons became &quot;stabilized&quot; at the close of the Archean Following a &quot;worldwide episode of igneous activity&quot; which marks the Archean/Proterozoic boundary This had a great effect on the types of sedimentary rocks which were formed The Archean was dominated by thick sequences of deep-water marine greywacke and shale Proterozoic sedimentary rocks resemble Phanerozoic sediments Except for the lack of fossils This includes both marine and continental sediments, as well as deposits associated with transitional environments Beaches, tidal flats, deltas, etc. Proterozoic sedimentary rocks can be grouped into 2 broad categories &quot;Platform sequences&quot; The stable internal portions of the cratons The elevations of the cratons appear to have been generally close to sea level since the beginning of the Proterozoic They were covered by shallow &quot;epicontinental&quot; (or epieric) seas during times of subsidence Other periods are marked by emergence and erosion Because of these periodic relative fluctuations, Proterozoic sedimentary sequences are characterized by numerous unconformities &quot;Geosynclinal sequences&quot; Thick sedimentary sequences in excess of 10,000 meters Nearly continuous sedimentation, so unconformities are rare The stratigraphic record is essentially complete Geosynclines commonly form on the trailing edges of continental plates Can be broken into two distinctive types of sedimentary environments Miogeosyncline Shallow-water sediments deposited on the continental shelf Include limestone, dolomite, shale, and sandstone These form in relatively stable settings which are free from igneous activity This means that there shouldn't be any volcanics associated with them Eugeosyncline Turbidites (greywacke) and pelagic sediments (shale) deposited on the continental slope and abyssal plain Carbonates are rare (limestone and dolomite) Volcanic flows and clastics may be present Eugeosynclines sound just like the types of sedimentary units common to the Archean Maybe the only difference in the Proterozoic is the addition of the 'stable' continental land masses and their associated sedimentary units Commonly, a change in the relative plate motions has resulted in the compression of these geosynclinal sedimentary belts Results in large-scale folding and thrusting, and ultimately mountain building Partial melting of the base of the geosynclinal sediments results in the formation and emplacement of granitic magma These active regions along the plate margins are called &quot;Mobile Belts&quot; The Appalachian Mountains are an excellent example of a compressed Paleozoic mobile belt Note: the terms Geosyncline, Miogeosyncline, and Eugeosyncline seem to have fallen out of favor with many geologists, and that is fine with me - they are, after all, only words
