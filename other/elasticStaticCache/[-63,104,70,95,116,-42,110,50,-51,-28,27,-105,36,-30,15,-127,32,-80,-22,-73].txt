DRAFT April 10, 2014 177 Lesson 4. Wind’s Temperature Wind Speed and Wind Direction Duration : 4 days Background Information Measuring and Recording Speed and Direction of the wind Weathermen gather information about the speed and direction of the wind. They do this to predict weather. They use instruments to measure the speed and direction of the wind. Wind speed is measured by an anemometer. The wind speed is shown by the number of circles or revolutions the anemometer makes in one minute. At times the anemometer almost does not move. We say that the wind is calm. A slow wind will move the anemometer a little. A moderate wind can turn the cups of the anemometer. At times the anemometer can make several circles or revolutions. We say that the wind is strong or fast. Some anemometers have a device that measures the speed of the wind. This can be used to name the wind. The wind vane is an instrument with an arrowhead and a tail. The wind pushes the tail. The arrowhead points toward the direction from which the wind comes. Winds are always described according to the direction from which they are blowing. As the wind strikes the tail of the wind vane, the wind vane turns so that the arrow points in the directions from which the wind is blowing Name Speed (km/hr) Calm 0-1 Light Air 1-5 Light Breeze 6-11 Gentle Breeze 12-19 Moderate Breeze 20-28",1.1997501850128174],["The same long-term average annual erosion rate which is used to determine whether there is any danger from erosion would be used to determine the approximate amount of beach area which would be lost if the landward erosion of the forebeach is not balanced by the landward erosion of the back beach or bluff.",1.1995220184326172],["Examine and demonstrate evidence that weather can be studied in terms of properties of the atmosphere such as pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and amount and type of clouds.",1.1994495391845703],["Examine and demonstrate evidence that weather can be studies in terms of properties of the atmosphere such as pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and amount and type of clouds.",1.1994495391845703],["Green power is a term used to describe electricity generated from renewable resources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, small hydro, and biomass, which have the least amount of environmental impact.",1.1972012519836426],["The independent variables that we used could be generated for any location on the Earth for which an estimate of surface synoptic weather can be given in terms of cloud cover and wind speed and direction.",1.1925182342529297],["Meteorologists describe the wind direction as the direction from which the wind is blowing.",1.1868728399276733],["Meteorologists describe the wind direction as the direction from which the wind is blowing.",1.1868728399276733],["However, asbestos fibres are inevitably released during machining of the fibre-cement products, and by long-term erosion of the material after it has been exposed to atmospheric weathering and wind, which causes the cement to degrade.",1.1802470684051514],["The local controller, working in the control tower, will determine which runway will be in use based upon wind, weather, and amount of traffic.",1.1799945831298828],["Erosion of soil is caused by water , wind , ice , and movement in response to gravity .

These include agricultural activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, overgrazing , deforestation , and improper construction activity. Improved management can limit erosion. Soil conservation techniques which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone crops with grass or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, terrace building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including cover crops and other plants ), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.",1.1776776313781738],["(Describes an inertial process which can explain observations of wind erosion even when wind conditions decreased below \"threshold.\")",1.1669543981552124],["According to the DOE's Wind Energy program, \"The term \"wind power\" describes the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity.",1.1631475687026978],["According to the DOE's Wind Energy program, \"The term \"wind power\" describes the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity.",1.1631475687026978],["The amount of this dilution, or dispersion, in the air depends on weather -- especially wind direction and speed.",1.1622947454452515],["The amount of this dilution, or dispersion, in the air depends on weather -- especially wind direction and speed.",1.1622947454452515],["The amount of this dilution, or dispersion, in the air depends on weather -- especially wind direction and speed.",1.1622947454452515],["The amount of this dilution, or dispersion, in the air depends on weather -- especially wind direction and speed.",1.1622947454452515],["Wind Vane: A weather instrument which indicated wind direction.",1.1599316596984863],["Climate describes the long-term weather patterns over a specified time frame for a specific area.
