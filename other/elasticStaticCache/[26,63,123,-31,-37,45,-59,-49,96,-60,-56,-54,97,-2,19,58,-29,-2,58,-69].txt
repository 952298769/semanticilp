do Separate Ways (Words & music by West - Mainegra) I see a change is coming to our lives It's not the same as it used to be And it's not too late to realise our mistake We're just not right for each other Love has slipped away left us only friends We almost seem like strangers All that's left \nbetween us are the memories we shared Of times we thought we cared for each other There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways And pick up all the pieces left behind us And maybe someday, somewhere along the way Another love will find us Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand Why her mom and dad are not together The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye Will tear at my heart forever There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways And pick up all the pieces left behind us And maybe someday, somewhere along the way Another love will find us Shake a Hand (words & music by Joe Morris) Just leave it to me Don't ever be ashamed Just give me a chance I'll take care of everything Your troubles I'll share Let me know and I'll be there I'll stay close to you Anyplace and anywhere Shake a hand, shake a hand Shake a hand if you can Be truthful to me, I'll be truthful to you I'm in love with you so Till I don't know what to do So, let's call it a day I said all I have to say Except don't forget to pray And shake a hand ev'ry day Shake a hand, shake a hand,
