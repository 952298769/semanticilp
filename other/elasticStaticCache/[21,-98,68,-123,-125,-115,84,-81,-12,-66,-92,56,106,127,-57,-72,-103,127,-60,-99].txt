the Richter Scale is Logarithmic to accommodate a wide variation in earthquake magnitudes 21 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE The Richter Scale 1) there is a tenfold increase in wave amplitude corresponding to an increase of one unit on the magnitude scale e.g. 4.5 - 5.5 implies 5.5 has 10 times 4.5 amplitude 2) there is a 32-fold increase in the amount of energy released for each unit increase in the magnitude scale e.g. 6.0 - 7.0 implies 7.0 has 32 times more energy 22 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The nature of earthquake destruction depends on: 1) magnitude of the earthquake 2) rock type 3) proximity to population centers 23 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The amount of structural damage attributable to vibration from earthquakes depend on: 1) the intensity and duration of the vibrations (e.g. Anchorage vs San Francisco) 2) the nature of the material upon which the structures rests -

the release of this energy may cause the ground to shake or tremble during an earthquake 3 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES 1) tectonic forces slowly deform the crust along faults or folds, the rocks bend and store elastic energy 2) frictional forces holding the blocks together are often overcome by slippage along the fault 3) slippage allows the rock to elastically return to its original shape producing vibrations earthquakes 4 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR EARTHQUAKES 1) movement of crustal blocks (plate boundaries) - the earth is divided into plates that move and interact at plate boundaries - Plate boundaries are the places where most earthquake occur 2) igneous activities (explosive volcanism) 3) nuclear explosions 5 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Sequence of Earthquake Generation 1) Foreshocks (small earthquakes that precede the main quake) 2) Main earthquake 3) Aftershocks (small earthquakes that follow the main quake) 6 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Seismology: The study of earthquake waves Seismograph: Device used to detect and record seismic waves Consists of: 1) seismometer -
