and CaCO3 + H+ + HCO3- = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- - important action in limestone terrain where solution features lead to Karst Topography - responsible for hard water (Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) - some rocks can be completely dissolved and leached away, few outcrops exist except in deserts 22 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - reactions of minerals in rocks with oxygen to form oxides (hydroxides if water is present) - commonly occurs as rusting e.g. 4Fe + 3O2 = 2Fe2O3 (iron oxide or hematite) - oxidation of pyrite e.g. FeS2 + O2 + H2O = FeO(OH) + H2SO4 23 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - important in the alteration of Fe/Mg minerals (olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite) and mafic rocks (basalt and gabbro) where oxidation imparts a red color to altered basalt) - the production of acids from spoil banks (mine tailings) that are transported by runoff from rainfall into streams killing fish and making water unfit for drinking is of environmental concern 24 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 3) HYDROLYSIS -
