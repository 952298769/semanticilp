Chapter 10-Geologic Time The age of the earth (4.5 billion years), is very large and it is difficult to comprehend the time scale Your text uses an example in which all of recorded time is divided into a year An alternative is to show the year in approximate proportions The important thing to notice is that changes were initially slow but have accelerated more \"recently\" Gelogical time is divided into two large segments Pre-cambrian (from the formation of the earth to 540 million years ago), during which eukaryotic cells developed Phanerozoic (from 540 million years ago to the present time) The Phanerzoic is further divided into three sections Paleozoic (540-225 million years ago) Mesozoic (225-65 million years ago) Cenozoic (65 million years ago to the present) Macroscopic life first appeared at the end of the Pre-cambrian and beginning of the Phanerozoic Paleozoic animals included molluscs, echinoderms (starfish, sand dollars), corals, early amphibians There was a mass extinction at the end of the paleozoic that wiped out 90% of all marine life on earth Mesozoic is divided into three periods Triassic (225-190 million years ago) Jurassic (190-136 million years ago) Cretaceous (136-65 million years ago) The mesozoic was the period of the dinosaurs (which were a specific sub-group of the archosaurs ) Dinosaurs can be divided into two large groups, based on their pelvic anatomy ornithischia (\"bird-hipped\") in which the pubic bone points backwards examples of ornithischia are triceratops hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs) heterodontosaurs (that were very early dinosaurs) saurischia (\"lizard-hipped\") in which the pubic bone points forwards The saurischia can be further divided into theropods (bipedal carnivores) (like Tyrannosaurus rex ) sauropods (large herbivores with long necks and tails) like Dipolodocus and Apatosaurus pro-sauropods (quadrupedal herbivores) Debates on dinosaurs are ongoing (warm-blooded vs cold-blooded, active vs slow moving, relationship with birds) Mass extinction of dinosaurs occurred 65 million years ago Mass extictions are not uncommon...at least eight others have occurred All mass extinctions are similar large extinction of global flora or fauna occur over a short period of time they may be cyclic (cycles of about 26.2 million years) theories include extraterrestrial impacts, climatic changes, magnetic field reversals Mass extinction of the dinosaurs may have been due to an extraterrestrial event At the boundary between the cretaceous period and the tertiary period is a large concentration of the element iridium, which is very uncommon on earth Iridium is more common in meteors According to a theory proposed by Walter Alvarez, a meteor imapact may have occurred, injecting a cloud of dust into the atmosphere This would interupt photosynthesis, killing off the herbivores and finally the carnivores that fed on them \nThe proposed site of impact also has rock with a high sulfur content that could have resulted in acid rain The extinction of the dinosaurs allowed other animals (mammals, insects, fish, birds) to take their place, during the cenozoic period Dating Geological and Evolutionary Events Before the mid-1700's the age of the earth had been expressed in theological terms (e.g. it was proposed that te earth formed in 4004 BC) Towards the end of the 1700's two descriptions of the geology of the earth had developed Neptunism-proposed by Abraham Werner (a German geologist)-all rocks were thought to have precipitated from a global flood (Werer did not invoke the biblical flood, but the contemporary popularity of the theory is probably due to that connection) Plutonism-proposed by James Hutton-all rocks were formed from heat and pressure inside the earth Toward the latter part of the 1800's new competing theories were proposed Uniformitarianism-Charles Lyell (Darwin had read Lyell's writings)-type and magnitude of geological forces have always been the same-this excluded a cooling earth, since forces would have changed with temperature Catastrophism-Leonce de Beaumont-\"catastrophes\" (i.e. large sudden changes) occur-but not arbitrarily or due to supernatural causes Changes were due to natural cooling and contraction of the earth's surface-causing surface irregularities (mountain ranges/canyons) Current theories of geology invoke plate tectonics proposed as continental drift by Alfred Wegener in 1912 Evidence for plates comes from magnetic fields when molten rock comes from the interior of the earth, iron contained in it will act like a small compass the rock solidifies as it cools, fixing the \"north\" direction of the compass the magnetic field of the earth has reversed several times stripes of differing polarity were found....this could only happen if new crust was being formed Plate boundaries Plates are on the srface of the earth The places where they collide are the fault zones Boundaries may be divergent-plates are moving away from each other and new material is being brought to the surface convergent-collision of two plates, one of which is forced under the other ( subducted )-mountain ranges are formed this way neutral-plates slide against each other (e.g. San Andreas fault) The age of the earth was a fundamental question in geology Based on known rates of cooling, and the temperature of the earth, Lord Kelvin proposed in late 1800's that the earth could not be older than 100 million years It was later found (early 1900's) by Henri Bequerel and Pierre Curie that the radioactive rocks in the earth were giving off heat, Kelvin had assumed that the earth had no internal heat source, and therefore underestimated the age (i.e. due to radioactivity, the earth is cooling more slowly than Kelvin thought).",0.9660704135894775],["Recently, findings reveal the molecule even in geological samples formed by the meteor impact that occurred around the time when the
