this is the time when some might not return they risk their lives from day to day trying to keep the fire at bay up the ridge and along the top i fear this frenzy might never stop with water hoses and retardant to fire trucks, dozers and helicopters are few with so much fire and so little time they are having some trouble cutting the line my heart goes to their families at home because they all know that we're only on lone no one knows the extent of the blaze or how much was burned in the last few days all we can do is hope for the best we must let the firefighters handle the rest i know this job can be dangerous and cruel and those that survive might be many or few maybe my daringness has caught me off guard maybe it's taken me one step too far all i can say is i will do my best for jesus, myself and all the rest.. Writen by: Amber L. Higgins Firefighters A Trusted soul to look our way and keep watch over a sunny day they put their lives on the line and oh so many are so fine A trusted friend to watch over you and cheer you up when you are blue they wake up before the crack of dawn to work until the sun is gone But they can do no harm, you see if only they knew what they mean to me they're there to lend a helping hand and give to others when they can They never thnk of about themselves and rush to work at the sound of bells at the tasks ahead they work very hard and sometimes receive a thank you card With team work they will succeed in my book they're in the lead they take care of many fires and leave so fast they squeal their tires They risk their lives from day to day as they hold the fires at bay in the summer they run wild a firefighters life is never mild Firefighters deal with wild brush fires and houses that have shorted wires when the forest is set on fire the firefighter never tires A big red engine passes by but we know they're never in a tie they are caring, loving, and kind to me they even get cats out of the trees I wish i could say what they mean to me firefighters fill my heart with glee Writen By : Amber L.

moonlight reflected In small country ponds After bedtime I battled A giant monster with My pumpkin flashlight My heaven was under The moessama tree When the day was Just the toys and me In stark naked

in time there's a school, a boy went there to read and write You were nobody's fool, you quickly learned the game and how to fight Then when he was ten years old his parents got divorced Father was so cold and mother was so forced It hurts so bad inside, he thought it was all his fault He discovered it was a lie, all the things he once was taught Tomorrow's child he cries But only in his mind He gets so cold inside He leaves his ones behind Today he's a full grown man Wife & children and a piece of land He's got a steady job, no trouble in the way Suddenly there she stands, again in love he takes her by the hand He tries to tell his wife, he wants this woman to stay in his life Tomorrow's child he cries But only in his mind He gets so cold inside He leaves his ones behind This is not the curse of God, nor of the accuser It's the curse of mankind that makes him an ordinary loser The older says: you can go to hell The younger says: she's crazy He loves them both, they know this well Pride hold them back, they lose him Women of this world today Don't wow this world away A man is fertile all his life, this need is not right to deny I know it is not fair, but it's a fact, it's not that we don't care Only one thing to do Put in the law a man can marry two Traitor The rats start to scream, you are threatening their dream They want peace and quiet, on their way to eternal night You can't be your own, it will make the others moan They plot and they scheme, they must kill every dream All around looking for another reason They must destroy someone, commited to a treason Traitor Goodnight to you, a bedtime story I tell it's true Under the sun nothing's new, nothing's won A philosophy, that holds no solutional key Go to work and get payed, don't ask for more they say A wageslave that's all you ever be They steal your life and leave you in misery Traitor The world seems chaos and confusion Someone gains on this illusion Just one life, in love's name you had it Still you dare refusing to live it Strange reality, you work your life away Killing yourself, just to pass another day That's not how the world was meant to be It's easy to see, still we don't, it's a pity All around looking for another reason All around you hear the nonsense reason No wonder you feel sick inside It hurts so much you have no place to hide Come with me I got the key to your heart Travel through time and space in my time warp A storm blows up outside, it's coming, it's coming The rats they hide inside, they're running, they're running But we are not afraid, we know why, we know why

okay Still I'm the only one Still I'm the lonely one, so come on The Coming Silence in the air, people are nervous, everyone is in fear This is the day the earth stands still, the sinners they must beware All through history people have tried to solve its mystery And today you have, can you still tell me that you don't believe I don't believe my own eyes I see a door it's open to paradise I see a new star coming in the black sky And I know that I am never gonna die The earth it starts to tremble as it draws its final breath A bodily chain reaction just like a man when he's near death People running scared, something siniter's in the way It's not science fiction, this is the final day Cosmic laws they cease today This is the return to beginning of time And there is a new world coming out of Orions belt And the strangest presence I have never felt The signs been in the fields so long You wouldn't believe it, you couldn't receive it Talking of the Kingdom come You refuse to see it, best is to leave it It is right in front of your eyes Hatred increasing, nature is leaving Our course was locked in suicide since the foundation No more grief and tears The shock waves start to ease down as our senses coming to The preparation has begun for the old world and the new Imagine people from the past and the future in the same place The four horsemen, the four dimensions, the same space

my hand Learn to fight Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right We got no choice Under command We're ordered to die or take this land Stupid bastards and religious freaks So safe in their castle keeps They turn away as a mother weeps Under the gun When brave men fall Under crimson skies There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's eyes Tears will dry For those I kill Remember no more their names but someone will The only way to be victorious Screw the fools who think it's glorious Who gives a toss \nabout the likes of us Under the gun Nobody's Home (Blackmore/Glover/Gillan/Lord/Paice)

reached over and said Hello Is there some planet you'd care to go And she said Venus on the rocks She got a mean streak Black Mamba don't compete She got a mean streak Temptation bitter sweet She drives me crazy gets inside my brain She spend my money down a drain So I roll over for my reward How much can I afford And she says Just a little more I can't take this no more I tried so hard but I can't get thru' the door Because one smile from those eyes And I stand there paralysed And she says Beg for more get down sucka you know what I like oh hang on Perfect Strangers (Blackmore/Glover/Gillan) Can you remember remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown And cold spirits of ice All my life I am the echo of your past I am returning the echo of a point in time Distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain Perfect Strangers I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your

they can do Hear the small voice of truth Above the shouting despair of the crowd What do you wish A Gypsy's Kiss Gets you strong for crying out loud Wasted Sunsets (Blackmore/Glover/Gillan) The day is gone when the angels come to stay And all the silent whispers will be blown away And lying in the corner a pair of high heel shoes Hanging on the wall gold and silver for the blues One too many wasted sunsets One too many for the road And after dark the door is always open Hoping someone else will show Someone is waiting behind an unlocked door Grey circles overhead empties on the floor The cracks in the walls have grown too long The slow hand is dragging on afraid to meet the dawn One too many wasted sunsets One too many for the road And after dark the door is always open Hoping someone else will show Hungry Daze (Blackmore/Glover/Gillan) In a dark and sweaty room in '69 tables turning Dancing girls, silly girls, all kinds of girls and it was loud Tuning up to madness in the back room candles burning Present the Stinking Hippy and throw the naked thunder to the crowd In the Hungry Daze The long and lonely highway drags along it's going nowhere Sickness and disease and mad corruption something's going wrong The mountain's getting cold and lonely the trees are bare We all came out to Montreux but that's another song You've heard it all before In hungry daze Along the Mountain Road to do some drinking and now we're mobile again Different girls, laughing girls, forever girls and it's so loud The crew have lost again they are beaten men The winning team united living for the crowd These are the hungry daze Bonus track on CD and cassette versions, and on the Knebworth '85 picture disc version of the LP: Not Responsible (Blackmore/Glover/Gillan/Lord/Paice) Found some money in an old black jacket I'm going out tonight, gonna find \nme a woman or two I don't know how long it'll last But I never regret the past When I wake up tomorrow, I'll be looking around for you I got no reason to be down at the station I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride Don't care where I go I never seem to know I never had a penny, but I never wondered why Oh no, I never wondered why If I'm cold I need some heat If I'm hungry then I eat I'm not responsible I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed I take my woman to the palace dancing I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine Oh, no no, I don't mind If it rains I stay inside If I'm scared I run and hide I'm not responsible,

throw your guitar down You punch the wall You curse the strings You forget music for now It hurts you too much You call to your ladies place No answer, never a right answer Throw the phone like the guitar Your parents call to out to you Worried about all the noise You tell them to shut up And go to your room To wallow in self pity The beauty of self pity Solitude your only friend left She'll never desert you Never leave you alone Sad, but so true No words can leave your mouth Without amazing disgust Infiltrating them deeply All that once you held close Once was who you are Now you loath Solitude always will be your best friend Stains Of Love Lost Tears cover the paper The hand of the heart No longer can move For your mouth is shut So much left unsaid Way too much heard Meanings misconstrued Hearts torn apart Like they're paper dolls No pain expected Less felt The feeling of the soul Pour out in tears The tears burn like acid Streaks cover your face The stains of love lost The scars of friendship lost Throbbing takes over the mind God's not forgotten But devils almost worshiped For the devils remove the pain The pain in your heart The pain your soul has From the ten or twenty words That were as excruciating As paper cuts A millimeter deep Yet more painful Then a thousand spears Bullets maces or swords That penetrate your body As much as these few words Penetrated your soul For though the cause is gone Your heart is still in your body And you'll never remove it What a pity Unjustly convicted Loves once found now are lost Where once you held tight You have no grip at all The meandering days pass by One to the next no different People change, faces change But hearts nor thoughts have faded Faded away at all Promiscuity made to failure And promises now broken Loves vowed are the ones lost The fates tamper with your mind With your heart, even your soul Just because they can Unjustly convicted Sentenced to a horrific death Christ your savior nowhere to be seen If only your tears were as such Instead they pour from your eyes Like the drop of rain From a torrential hurricane And you are left wondering Why, why if love is pure Love cannot bear imperfections If love truly is love Then why does it hurt so much And as you lay in \nbed Contemplating your death Your lover comes to the door Only to reveal their true love And confine you in misery Your whole, entire life Juliet Juliet lies down to sleep Gives the knife her soul to keep Romeo sees her from afar And in the ground he does carve I love you know, loved you then Never shall these feelings ever bend Like the lightning crashing from above To your memory I'll hold tough The days how long, nights so deep Never shall my heart ever sleep The long blonde hair bright as gold Many a man his bliss hath sold And nothing short of a shadow's kiss Has ever made on more remiss Made on feel he himself hath died Solely because of those who lied About content, happiness, joy Those who played us like a toy Once that's carved he walks to the grave Cursing now all loves slaves Juliet's eyes now are closed Drops of blood still on her nose The knife still stuck in her bosom He now thinks how he'll be so lonesome The countless days with love amiss The numerous nights with out that kiss And before he knows what takes his mind The knife from her chest in his hands he finds And plunges it deep into his skull To shrew the pain, make it annul With his last words he cries for Juliet His words were lost like the name he forgets For 'tis not Juliet there in the grave 'Tis his Julia, for whom he himself hath slain And as the two caskets down the street are marched Though the fountains under the arch Tears are shed for the senseless crime But this crime is the crime of the time Scent Of the Flame You wake up from your sleep And feel an odd heat on you You see the forest around you afire Smoke gushes from the dry trees Trees fall and block all your paths All on fire, all impossible to avoid You are left alone in your campground With just your tent, and your clothes You panic but think quickly and pack your clothes And pack up your tent You have very little to your name But you are determined to keep it all You look around for a creek you bathed in But you see trees afire block that means of escape You look for the first path you cleared But even though the trees are all gone The bushes off to the sides of it have caught And they are an impenetrable wall of flames Hundred year oak trees fall like maples The pines, the pines where the sun doesn't ever shine Fall like they're just toothpicks for God You have no way to escape unharmed And though you don't accept it That harsh reality is forced upon you So you close your eyes and run headlong Into the fiery, flaming torch of Hell on Earth And eventually you emerge from the fire Hair singed, skin scorched, but tent and clothes in tack They reek of the fire, but are still yours The few things you had are still yours Even though they now have the scent of the flame Dale Lovers ripped and torn away Tears come forth every day The road was the last one to hold The one in the coffin all cold Cold in body, but warm in heart For his love of you shall never part Though stick and stone and gravel kill He has left his spirit all for good will All the pain and anguish he felt then Is not felt now as he is in Zen Or Heaven, or whatever the afterlife has Where we all will someday pass But here you remain, a crying wreck As a grieving widow this life you shall trek Though the pain will some day pass Your love stop to last For he was your life, passion, muse Your alpha and omega, heart's woo He was your all in all Not a once short did he fall But the Lord's taken him away from us Not our choice, but his plans are a must As much as to our disliking it is All the better are his sights and promises For one day not too many years from today We'll look back on this moment and say It was all for the best, as His plans always are And we'll look up to Heaven so afar And say \"Soon I'll be with you once again\" \"Soon I'll be with you my best of friends\" Sinners Frustrations set in Words confused Meanings missed Love her still you do But others come to view They all fail in compairison Through no fault of their own Her light still shines bright Brighter then any other you've seen Or are your eyes not seeing right For all have sinned And fallen short of her glory But you fail to see her sins it seems For many they have been Not as many as your own however You play God and judge her and others But you have not proper insight So you judgements aren't all accurate You condemn the righteous Uplift the followers of Satan Contradict yourself every statement Make liars seem like truth tellers The honest men hypocrits All because you love and unlovable Actually, she is lovable Just unobtainable Short sights and materialistic problems Are all holding you apart But it's those things which will never fade So you must stop judging others Start judging yourself And find happiness Where no one else has Blankets The magnificent blanket of security you once had Has been stolen from you while you were sleeping No longer does it keep you warm Or protect you from the cold breezes Or keep the penetrating rains away Instead now you are left at nature's mercy You see ominous clouds far \nover head Rains, sleets and hails may not be far away And that concerns you, scares you a lot You know the cold isolation is brutal You've had it before and hated every second of it But now it looks like it is back for a while You see others all around you with their blankets And you just envy them so much You think of yourself as being better than them You think that you alone deserve to be happy To be protected, kept warm, comforted Even despite the fact so many of the blankets Are covered with holes, and many stains But you had to find you own self pity and misery Keeps you blind to things like the others problems But just as you curse that which stole your blanket You see close friends without one as well Many in much poorer condition then you could fathom Some never having blankets in their life times Some having their blankets nearly suffocate them And you look at yourself on the water of the lake And you vow never to be without a blanket Anywhere close to as long as the others For though a blanket isn't a need to survive It's the most important thing to happiness And you will never be this sad again Julia's Heart You say you love me Yet a dollar takes presidence Even though the dollar should It still seems cruel You say you tell no lies Yet how do I know the truth Because you never show me What you really feel Sayings are said a million times Kisses exchanged like looks of the eyes More intimates things cherished Yet lost in the sparkle and fade Loves and lusts confused Materialism seems attractive Because materialism is something seen Where as my heart never is For all I say all I do Is forgotten by you today But remembered tomorrow But too often tomorrow is too late For other things come into our lives And though memories never change The values of them do For times makes silver tarnish And some thoughts fade away But the dream of happiness together doesn't It remains vivid through time Just like the scars in the heart The many, many scars in your heart Innumerable, and unmistakable Unhidable, unforeseeable, and undeniable And now you must go on Finding other lovers Finding ways to carry on But you can't and won't forget her The ways she made you feel so great And the ways she crashed your world Let's just hope someone can repair it The ravages of Julia's heart Public Display The slow pulses of your heart slowly disappear Charities assumed where only desperation exists Desperation for the joys of the heart Desperation for all that is right in the world Desperation for all that is held sacred in the heart Desperation to know the love isn't in vain Each ever slowing pulse emitts a small cry As it passes by the ventricles for the last time Because it knows it'll never see them again Before the cold hand of death takes hold All those once warm arteries and capilaries That flowed with an amazing love Collapse as that love has been stolen from them And your limbs slowly turn blue Your mind is a wreck in every way imaginable Your most amazing memories of passionate love Appearing to have meant nothing more Then the most insecently momentuous flings You have lost all sense and sensablility You cherish none of which you did years before All that once was intimate and secure to yourself Now is on public display for approval Approval by those of Satan, of those of God And most importantly, approval of yourself Ah the beauties of the need of self approval Never perfect, never horrid Always a malcontent existance with uncertain purpose No Other Man's You see them all there Holding hand, kissing lips And you think to yourself \"I've been there\" God you've been there But that was then And this is now Now is the time you live Your regrets for mistakes You promises left unfulfilled And your heart Your ever so empty heart Do not matter now Because they belong to her And she is no longer yours No other man's Nor woman's thank God But just not yours any longer But still you see the others Together for years Or just months or weeks Yet you envy their bodies For they have What you only can dream of Someone to kiss them good night Someone to hold them close When the troubles of life are too much When all that's good has gone bad And when they dreams are crushed And their hearts shattered Yet here you stand Alone, deeply in solitude For though all say You are a one in a million catch Only three have caste out for you And though all threw you back You still hold the dreams The ideas and images of the one The one who's heart had to listen Not to itself, but to its future White Smoke Weeks go by with out a word But fear has no grip on you For even though you haven't forgotten You've been too distracted Your friends keep you focused On your life, on your muses You find intimate contact with others Forgetting what real contact is When it's with the one you love When it's to show your love Not just to hide yourself Not just to help heal your heart Not to just help you forget All the pain that's in your heart From the lack of true love And contact, and knowledge For all that was know as gospel Now has clouds of white smoke Keeping you guessing as to what Is and was really there For no word is sometimes better Than a word that reminds you Of \nhow much you did love Of how much you did really care And how much you really still miss her For she made you strong when weak She alone could heal your mortal wounds She was God's gift to you Or so it seemed before the smoke came And now you're left wondering Just how God really does Heal the broken hearted And console the contrite spirit First Blow Days slip by like the tears from your cheeks The pains still as violent as the first blow But is now looked down on by many As a sign of weakness and patheticness For time has pass, time heals all wounds They say she's forgotten They say you should forget her as well But you can't forget all of what Once was your every breath You're hers and only hers Yet not hers at all And she's yours and only yours And at the same time has been ripped from you By senseless materialistic uncertain idiocy All for the sake of thinking better So you stand at the dawn of another new day That fateful restless night ages ago And you look at yourself, who you are You see the same face, same hand, same tongue And you think to yourself It's been too many nights with Too so suddenly be without And despite your hands face and tongue are the same Your heart isn't and never will be For she is yours in heart but someone else's in hand And it's her face that's against another's And it's now her heart, that has two men's affection Innocent Ignorance Where once warm hands held tight Now cooler hearts stand alone Time has passed like sands through the hourglass But the feelings of the heart hold fast Trials and tribulatiosn for us both Some of the most challenging times of our lives But we'd always be ok at night When we'd return home to each other Hold hands, and ever so softly kiss Softly, yet deeply, and passionately All our cares and worries would vanish As if they never existed to begin with We had a special, innocent pure love Despite the fact we knew we didn't have long Our future's destined to be different Our ambitions always the same Quantity was never a matter to us For the quality was always more then amazing And when the time to realize this happened Amazingly deep and seemingly never ending pain came Our worlds were flipped and we were tossed with chaos But despite all the pain, there was no anger As time passed the pain slowed Duller and duller it was with each passing month But it was still there like a constant headache But now a year approaches and we face a challenge Whether to celebrate our times together Or whether to mourn the losses we assumed Or whether we should just pretend like nothing happened Our loves nor lives the same as before So the fish is left to wander the stream in his westward direction Only to hope to not be pulled down by the easterner Thanksgiving The day to give thanks comes and goes You give thanks for your heart You give thanks for your life And you give thanks for the love of your heart Despite no longer do you hold it You remember how she made you feel How complete and bright she made your life And how she made you feel invincible The day has passed without many adieus The days to commemorate a love of life The days to commemorate a life of love And the days to remember all of our blessings A year has passed since these last occurrences Some you beg God never to remind you of Others you pray for every day to be repeated Like the day when you fell in love for the first time That day when the world you live in No longer remained in black, whites and grays But became filled with the colors of the rainbow The colors of love, the colors of life And your contrite spirit once again had breath For God did hear you and consoled the broken heart But it was only to let Satan break your brain Spill blood and muscles and heart and lungs all over Cover the pavement with all your good sense Rape the innocence of your mind Fragmentize all your memories and make you doubt All that you once held sacred, holy and just So this thanksgiving you're left here now With a healed body and a healed mind But a broken heart, which may never mend Iris Music swirls in your head and makes you shiver Sheer ecstacy fills your ears and hands But as the piece comes to an end For some odd reason the feeling doesn't change The source which was once your music Has changed to simply your surroundings now Or so it seems to have for now you are left in silence And the rest of the lonely is like a broken heart A single solitary player of a single solitary instrument For now you are confused as you look to your right And you see a new set of blue eyes looking at you There is no love, no lust, no admiration nor exhilaration But at the same time there is no hard heart behind them For that heart listens to the music of your voice Not the mistakes of your hands nor your lack of charm Impressions irrevocably riveted in place eons ago But deeper more purging ideas planted by your music The music of your heart, the music of your soul For the mind knows not what the heart sees And the mind never could comprehend what the ear hears The pale icy cold metallic blue irises never shall lie Just like the chords in our music \nnever lie If only the iris would last longer then the chords And if only the iris was as harmless as the chords New Start The time to weep has not passed The days and night not gone fast But now you see a new one near And it's that which you fear The feelings aren't quite the same But it's your heart that does claim That times gone by aren't to stay It is this time this very day That hurt shall no longer rest Where love and kindness fit the best For in those eyes you did see What it was that would set you free Free from the pain and misery of your past Free from the love that did not last Free from the strings tied to your heart That were there right from the start And free from the green stars in her eyes For it was those stars that made you cry And now you look into another's blue iris And it's her cheek you now kiss Your heart still isn't all what it once was But know you've past that feeling so remiss Neither love nor pain now has hold of you But a happy confusion of what is true You know not what your heart really feels But you recognize the absence of what was real And now when you kiss a hand your heart doesn't ache And when you get a hug your heart doesn't break For now in your eyes you see not a heart Now in her eyes you see a fresh new start Quantum's From the deepest trenches of the lake A small bright light emerges A tempest of blue and white all at once Just in the one tiny photon there Your tiny vessel of life is rocking slowly On the harsh waves of the turbulent sea Queasiness in your stomach takes hold Not from the light, more in from the lack of light In enough quantums to keep you satisfied That light no matter how small is magnificent Always has been, always will be Even if it does come in different quantities Because regardless of where the light comes from It's always from some sort of precious hidden jewel But it's the lights from blue diamonds That are the light which you always shall search Because the light like the rock itself Can and will withstand all the world's heats Pressures, blows, colds and sharp cuts Its that light which will never be hidden once discovered But to uncover all its amazing deep beauty You must risk your life by plunging into the sea The cold, deep, tretcherous, mischievious and dark sea To find the rock from which it emminates And uncover it to bring to the surface to keep as yours Where you can polish it and keep it close at heart So when the waves of the sea make you sick again You can look at the jewel and find purity And then find inner strength and peace in yourself Only to look at the jewel again And wonder how you survived so long with out it Hey guys!",0.3575094938278198],["Brandy Station Va October the 27th

Population Visible at Great Distance fig 28.1 Population Impacts the Environment Total population of the earth in 1995 reached 5.7 billion More people consume more food, water, energy and raw materials More people create greater amount of waste A GROWING POPULATION Historical Perspective Earliest fossils from Europe are 500,000 years old Humans spread to North America 12,000 years ago Population 10,000 years ago was only 5 million With agriculture, populations rapidly expanded More dependable sources of food fig 28.2 Development of towns and cities Bubonic plague in 1348 killed nearly four-fifths of population fig 28.3 Recovery and increase to 500 million by 1650 Seventeenth century Renaissance renewed interest in science Scientific developments led to Industrial Revolution The Present Situation Global birth rate for last 300 years: 30 per year per 1000 people Present rate decreased slightly to 25 per 1000 Decreased death rate to 9 per 1000 people per year Net increase in annual population rate Population increasing \nat rate of 1.6% per year Will double population in 43 years Annual increase of 90 million per year Increase per minute of 170 people United Nation estimates population of 6 billion by 2000 AD Expected stabilization at 8.5 to 18 billion by 2090 Must stabilize population due to limited resources The Future Situation Localization of human populations in year 2000 60% in tropical or subtropical regions 20% in China 20% in developed or industrialized nations People in industrialized areas control 85% of wealth and materials Standard of living 20 times higher Lower infant mortality rate Higher life expectancy Variable world age structure affects population growth Industrialized nations: 20% of population under 15 years Developing countries have nearly twice as many fig 28.4 Populations of developing countries will continue to grow faster Industrialized nations will constitute smaller portion of the global population Quality of life dependent on stabilizing world`s population THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE Immediate World Challenge to Produce More Food Food production increased by 2.6 times since 1950 Population expanded at greater rate Most cultivatable land already in use Topsoil lost from agricultural land Consumption in developed countries increasing at greater rate Must Increase Agricultural Productivity Identify new crops, especially in tropics Major crops have been cultivated for thousands of years Few new plants cultivated since 1800 Examples: rubber and oil palms Crops selected for ease of growth Kinds of Agricultural Crops Three primary food crops: corn, wheat, rice 5000 types have ever been used for food, only 150 used regularly Various plants used for medical treatments Reasons for cultivating new plants Altered standards of cultivation Extraction of industrial products, oils, drugs, chemicals The Prospects for More Food Must increase productivity of current crops Improvement needed in tropical and subtropical regions Improvement of strains via Green Revolution: 1950-1970 Ten-fold increase in Mexican wheat production Food production in India outpaced population growth China became self-sufficient in food production Limitations of Green Revolution Agricultural techniques require great energy output Extensive use of costly pesticides and herbicides Commercial prices held low in developing areas Present solutions Improve production of current crops Not likely to bring more land into agricultural use Fully apply traditional means of plant breeding and selection fig 28.6 Include wheat, corn and rice Develop new crops in tropics and subtropics Develop improved strains via genetic engineering Resistance to specific herbicides results in better weed control Tolerance to soil conditions and mineral toxicity Ability to fix nitrogen Use of hydroponic agriculture problematic Resources of oceans are not inexhaustible Reduce over fishing of specific areas Develop new microorganism-based foods: Spirulina OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Nuclear Power Chernobyl incident One of four reactors exploded in April 1986 Emergency safety systems shut off Power surge precipitated the explosion Released over 100 megatons of radioactivity Millions of times greater than Three Mile Island Significant human exposure to radiation Death due to radiation poisoning The promise of nuclear power Fossil fuels no longer cheap sources of energy Nuclear power could provide new source Undesirable side effects to burning fossil fuels Produces sulfur and carbon dioxide New problems associated with nuclear power Safe operation of power plants Disposal of radioactive wastes Safe decommission of power plants Prevention of terrorism and sabotage Important to develop other alternative energy sources Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming CO2 in atmosphere maintains world temperature 25% higher than without it Traps heat-producing infrared light Creates greenhouse effect Associated with increased energy use Most gas from burning of fossil fuels Burning of forests also increases atmospheric gas Global warming results from increased CO2 Mean global temperature increased 1% since 1900 Masked by heat-absorbing capacity of oceans Level of CO2 could double by 2035 Warming exacerbated by trace gases Include chlorofluorocarbons Absorb infrared wavelengths better than CO2 Ancillary problems Rising sea levels Altered growth rates in plants Leads to global climate change Pollution Example: Rhine river Fire in chemical warehouse washed chemicals into river Deadly mercury and pesticides killed fish and plants Water became unsafe to drink River slowly cleaned itself The Threat of Pollution Results from industrial byproducts Plastics cannot decompose Efforts being made to develop new microorganisms yet unsuccessful Water pollution Not enough water to dispose of wastes Detergents increase algae, decrease water quality Agricultural pollution Widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers fig 28.7 Toxic chemicals remain in ecosystems Chlorinated hydrocarbons banned in U.S. Concentrate in the food chain Must develop responsible attitude toward use of chemicals Acid Precipitation Sulfur compounds produced when coal burned fig 28.8 Mixes with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid Acid dispersed by winds high up in atmosphere Effects seen far from where acids are produced Biological consequences Death of thousands of fresh water lakes fig 28.9 Seepage into groundwater Destruction of forests fig 28.10 Expensive to capture and remove emissions The Ozone Hole Visible to electronic equipment over Antarctica fig 28.11 Hole is nearly the size of the U.S. Thinning of ozone layer first appeared in 1975 Presence of hole coincides with Antarctic spring Cause of ozone hole attributed to chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) Chemicals used in cooling, fire extinguishers and styrofoam CFC`s reduce O3 ozone molecule to O2 gas Global agreements to halt CFC production Problem will get worse because of quantity currently in lower atmosphere that will reach upper atmosphere in later years Biological consequences Increased ultraviolet light penetration Increases incidence of human skin cancers Damage to photosynthetic plankton Destruction in the Tropics Traditional method of shifting agriculture fig 28.12 Crops grow for only a few years in poor soils Require decades without crops to rebuild nutrients High population density does not permit renewal No longer sufficient for even traditional manioc crop Dead materials collected for firewood, not recycled Forests being cleared at too great a rate Equal to the size of Indiana per year At the present rate they will be gone in thirty years Need to change from one-use to \ncontinuous agriculture fig 28.13 The Loss of Biodiversity Serious and rapidly accelerating problem Given the loss of species of known plants and animals Given the loss of habitat, especially in tropics Calculate loss of 20% of biodiversity within in next 30 years Loss greater considering we have named only 15% of world's eukaryotic organisms Loss important for several reasons Moral, ethical and aesthetic grounds Organisms necessary to sustain our own existence Opportunity to study them lost Also lose potential benefits of these organisms Upset balance of living communities and their physical environment Effect soils, water regulation, nutrient cycles, atmosphere and climate, absorb pollution Creating conditions of instability and unproductivity Little known about overall ecology of communities and ecosystems Cannot replace with systems that will support humans Damage is currently irreparable ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Attempts to Find Solutions to Environmental Problems Studied by environmental scientists Applied science associated with ecology, geology, meteorology Environmental Problems Can Be Solved fig 28.14 Assessment Gathering information Construct model of situation Use model to predict future events Risk analysis Analyze environmental impact Evaluate potential for solving problem Determine adverse effects of solution Public education Address problem in terms the public can understand Present alternative actions Explain costs and results of various choices Political action Choice made through elected officials Difficult to implement if multinational problems Follow-through Monitor results of environmental actions Evaluate and improve initial analysis and modeling WHAT BIOLOGISTS HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE Environmental Problems Require Applications of Biological Principles All living things need to use energy of the sun Need to understand basic principles and their applications Some areas of world are experiencing the future`s problems now Scientific

& Paul 11: Winter 12: Laughing As I Pray 1: Me Happy That's a stupid hat you're wearing It doesn't really match your hair Did I ever tell you that your breath is worse Than what you wear That's exactly what she told him At least that's what he told me So I guess we could conclude They're not a happy family Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority That's a lovely dress you're wearing Too bad your figure can't make it work When I hear the things you say I wonder if your brain can work That's exactly what he told her At least that's what she told me I scream my calls, I lock my doors I'm suddenly filled with apathy Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority Although, I'd like to add the game in bed is a necessity To make me happy Make me happy Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority Although, I'd like to add the game in bed is a necessity 2: Breakfast I woke up between dawn and night Thought I heard the voice of Mommy Sounds as if my parents have a fight So I woke up my brother lying next to me I wonder why she's making all that noise Better go and check it out So without trying to breathe only the sound of little feet We were about to discover what that noise was all about And as we opened up the door We saw them lying on the kitchen floor We were grateful for they both did their best But we said 'Hey, there must be an easier way to make break fast' They both got up real fast As if they were caught (or something) And then we understood at last It was a surprise breakfast they were planning Mommy stumbled, 'Later, kids, you'll understand' While Daddy was busy putting on his pants We said 'We already do, don't worry, we'll do the rest' So far for our quest, we made coffee, boiled eggs We made them breakfast 3: I Smoke A Lot I smoke a lot I'm not talking weed or pot I smoke the regular stuff I smoke a lot And if you're a smoker too You are to know sometimes it's tough To be in healthy company People who always say You smoke a lot Imagine the amount of money you could save if you'd quit You smoke a lot By now you'd have a bike, aren't you concerned about the kids Well, of course, sure I am, concerned (a bit) But about that bike, I could get killed with it And is that what you really want (It's not) So I smoke a lot I smoke a lot My God I smoke a lot, and I feel fine And I feel fine I smoke a lot I smoke a lot I smoke a lot I smoke a lot I smoke a lot Sometimes it's great Sometimes it's not But I smoke a lot I smoke a lot I smoke a lot I smoke a lot 4: Walk Away I will walk away from you (Don't stop me) I will walk away from you (Don't blame me) I have felt the ugly midget kicking on my knee I have seen the ugly midget walking over me I will tell you what I've learned We're through as far as I'm concerned Break up and just before we do I will walk away from you I will walk away from you (Stop me) I will walk away from you (Blame me) I have had enough of you Tell me you hate me too Or embrace me and forget What I have said to you I will tell you what I've learned We're one as far as I'm concerned Make up and just before we do I will be walking back to you Walking back to you Walking back to you Walking \nback to you Walking back to you 5: Elegia Oh, God, I haven't read your book I'm sure it was divine Especially the part where you turned water into wine Oh, God, I want you to clear my mind It's covered up with dirt And I want to taste your skin One time before I taste the earth Oh, God, I apologize I didn't knock when I arrived Oh, God, I apologize I didn't say goodbye last night Oh, God Now I guess you have your way As I taste the earth today Now I guess you have your way As I taste the earth today Now I guess you have your way As I taste the earth today Now I guess you have your way As I taste the earth today 6: My Heart Not so long ago We both felt love became a word No more than that With sex that felt like wings without a bird The only thing that we both love Is in the cradle that we rock Six hands, six feet, but just one beat The ticking of the clock I always heard I could get hurt (I knew that from the start) Break my face, my back, my arms, my neck But please don't break my heart Break my face, my back, my arms, my neck But please don't break my heart Solid wood will rot If you don't keep it from the rain We were surprised when we found out That love feels just like pain I always heard I could get hurt I knew that from the start Break my face, my back, my arms, my neck But please don't break my heart Break my face, my back, my arms, my neck But please don't break my heart 7: I Wanna Meet The Man I've been thinking all night about this song The music's okay but I can't find words to say I could sing that I'm a Virgin and show my tits Decree how sex improves the world In which masturbation is the thing of the day \"I'm afraid I haven't got that much to say\" I thought about \"Hello, fool, I love you\" Or repeat a hundred times \"How do you do\" I Wanna Dance with Somebody, hey, I like that sound But there ain't nobody Humpin' Around I wanna meet the man who wrote these lyrics (he must be great) I wanna meet the man who wrote these songs I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man And while I sing these words to you There's a Rat in my Kitchen, don't know what I'll do Forget about the rat and sing along Cause we feel so strong and we can't go wrong We walk hand in hand to the promised land I think I met the man who wrote these lyrics I guess I have ignored the things he said I think that I have noticed how expensive perfume Never covers up a smelly breath I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man I wanna meet the man 8: What The Hell Is Love He was not as tall and rather fat He had a labrador and a lumping cat Born in a country with a broken heart He had enough money and a credit card Told bedtime stories to his Teddybear Gave him lots of hugs and a dress to wear He had a small apartment (what a lovely sight) He watched MTV all night Where the hell was friendship He must have turned it off And most of all he wondered what is love What the hell is love He enjoyed the silence more and more As he heard the door slam right next door He had a fancy Parker and a diary In which he wrote some poetry And as he went to bed at night The cat's eyes gave him ample light To make him lie awake and see The content of his misery Where the hell was friendship He must have turned it off And most of all he wondered what is love What the hell is love Where the hell was friendship He must have turned it off And most of all he wondered what is love What the hell is love 9: I Will Return To You Today there's nothing more to say But someday I'll return to you Today things didn't go our way Maybe tomorrow I will return to you Today I'd like to slip away from all this pain Someday, I'll return to you Today I'd like to be a cell inside your vein Maybe tomorrow I will return to you Once more I'd like to put a spider in your bed For that, I will return to you I want you to hear the things I never said For that, I will return to you Someday, I'll return to you Dry the rain inside my head To hear the things I never said I will return to you To be a light beam through a cloud To laugh at things I'm singing now I will, I will return to you I will return to you, to you I will return to you Someday I'll return to you I will return to you Maybe tomorrow I will return to you 10: The Ballad Of Lea & Paul Paul studied a lot At least he pretended to He had too much on his mind It was too small To see the beauty of it all Lea loved him a lot At least she pretended to He was always on her mind She said, \nPaul, There's a fire in the hall And when it finally burned the questions For the answers he had found He realized it ought to be the other way around There's a fire burning in the hall It looks great, I don't care, let it burn I don't care, I don't care I don't care at all They got married right on the spot At least I presume they did I have too much on my mind To tell you the fall Of Lea and Paul Out in the hall For the moment that this song has stopped They'll probably be dead So it's better maybe wiser To leave the rest unsaid There's a fire burning in the hall It looks great, I don't care, let it burn I don't care, I don't care I don't care at all There's a fire burning in the hall It looks great, I don't care, let it burn I don't care, I don't care I don't care at all I don't care at all I don't care at all I don't care at all I don't care at all I don't care at all 11: Winter You're crying but as long as it's transparent and not red There's no real reason to be sad to the people who are Smiling, always happy, always gay they do not know That the edges of the mouth can move the other way You're freezing, the ice on which you nearly slipped outside Is in your body, in your mind, getting warmer you are Dreaming, quite useless but it feels okay to you In a world that's dreaming too, in a world in which you Keep on searching for a thing sublime When all you need is inside of you Everybody's waiting for springtime Well winter can be cozy too Cherish the moment, cherish the key That leads to sane insanity Cherish incompetence, cherish me Don't ever cherish somebody who Keeps on searching for a thing sublime When all you need is inside of you Everybody's waiting for springtime Well winter can be cozy too 12: Laughing As I Pray As I'm walking through these streets again I'm crawling And as I try to live my life again I'm falling down Can you pick me up Can you let it stop Can you make it go away Can you pick me up Can you let it stop Can you make it go away Won't somebody help me, is it hard To let me find my way Won't somebody love me (for a start) I'm laughing as I pray Where is the road I must look at the road I must pray a little

Merwin CHAPTER ONE CEREMONY AFTER AN AMPUTATION Spirits of the place who were here before I saw it to whom I have made such offerings as I have known how to make wanting from the first to approach you with recognition bringing for your swept ridge trees lining the wind with seedlings that have grown now to become these long wings in chorus where the birds assemble and settle their flying lives you have taught me without meaning and have lifted me up without talk or promise and again and again reappeared to me unmistakable and changing and unpronounceable as a face dust of the time a day in late spring after the silk of rain had fallen softly through the night and after the green morning the afternoon floating brushed with gold and then the sounds of machines erupting across the valley and elbowing up the slopes pushing themselves forward to occupy you to be more of you who remain the untouched silence through which they are passing I try to hear you remembering that we are not separate to find you who cannot be lost or elsewhere or incomplete nature of the solitary machine coming into the story from the minds that conceived you and the hands that first conjured up the phantom of you in fine lines on the drawing board you for whom function is all the good that exists you to whom I have come with nothing but purpose a purpose of my own as though it was something we shared you that were pried from the earth without anyone consulting you and were carried off burned beaten metamorphosed according to plans and lives to which you owed nothing let us be at peace with each other let peace be what is between us and you now single vanished part of my left hand bit of bone finger- end index who began with me in the dark that was already my mother you who touched whatever I could touch of the beginning and were how I touched and who remembered the sense of it when I thought I had forgotten it you in whom it waited under your only map of one untrodden mountain you who did as well as we could through all the hours at the piano and who helped undo the bras and found our way to the treasure and who held the fruit and the pages and knew how to button my right cuff and to wash my left ear and had taken in heart beats of birds and beloved faces and hair by day and by night fur of dogs ears of horses tongues and the latches of doors so that I still feel them clearly long after they are gone and lake water beside the boat one evening of an ancient summer and the vibration of a string over which a bow was moving as though the sound of the note were still playing and the hand of my wife found in the shallows of waking you who in a flicker of my inattention signalled to me once only my error telling me of the sudden blow from the side so that I looked down to see not you any longer but instead a mouth full of blood calling after you who had already gone gone gone ahead into what I cannot know or reach or touch leaving in your place only the cloud of pain rising into the day filling the light possessing every sound becoming the single color and taste and direction yet as the pain recedes and the moment of it you remain with me even in the missing of you small boat moving before me on the current under the daylight whatever you had touched and had known and took with you is with me now as you are when you are already there unseen part of me reminding me warning me pointing to what I cannot see never letting me forget you are my own speaking only to me going with me all \nthe rest of the way telling me what is still here THE STRANGER (After a Guarani legend recorded by Ernesto Morales) One day in the forest there was somebody who had never been there before it was somebody like the monkeys but taller and without a tail and without so much hair standing up and walking on only two feet and as he went he heard a voice calling Save me as the stranger looked he could see a snake a very big snake with a circle of fire that was dancing all around it and the snake was trying to get out but every way it turned the fire was there so the stranger bent the mink of a young tree and climbed out over the fire until he could hold a branch down to the snake and the snake wrapped himself around the branch and the stranger pulled the snake up out of the fire and as soon as the snake saw that he was free he twined himself around the stranger and started to crush the life out of him but the stranger shouted No No I am the one who has just saved your life and you pay me back by trying to kill me but the snake said I am keeping the law it is the law that whoever does good receives evil in return and he drew his coils tight around the stranger but the stranger kept on saying No No I do not believe that is the law so the snake said I will show you I will show you three times and you will see and he kept his coils tight around the stranger's neck and all around his arms and body but he let go of the stranger's legs Now walk he said to the stranger Keep going so they started out that way and they came to a river and the river said to them I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I save them from dying of thirst and all they do is stir up the mud and fill my water with dead things the snake said One the stranger said Let us go on and they did and they came to a carand&#225;-i palm there were wounds running with sap on its trunk and the palm tree was moaning I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I give them my fruit and my shade and they cut me and drink from my body until I die the snake said Two the stranger said Let us go on and they did and came to a place where they heard whimpering and saw a dog with his paw in a basket and the dog said I did a good thing and this is what came of it I found a jaguar who had been hurt and I took care of him and he got better and as soon as he had his strength again he sprang at me wanting to eat me up I managed to get away but he tore my paw I hid in a cave until he was gone and here in this basket I have a calabash full of milk for my wound but now I have pushed it too far down to reach will you help me he said to the snake and the snake liked milk better than anything so he slid off the stranger and into the basket and when he was inside the dog snapped it shut and swung it against a tree with all his might again and again until the snake was dead and after the snake was dead in there the dog said to the stranger Friend I have saved your life and the stranger took the dog home with him and treated him the way the stranger would treat a dog THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES At what moment can it be said to occur the grand stillness of this symmetry whose horizons become the horizon and whose designer's name seems to be Ours even when the designer has long since vanished and the king his master whom they called The Sun in his day is nobody again here are the avenues of light reflected and magnified and here the form's vast claim to have been true forever as the law of a universe in which nothing appears to change and there was nothing before this except defects of Nature and a waste of marshes a lake a chaos of birds and wild things a river making its undirected way it was always the water that was motion even while thirty six thousand men and six thousand horses for more than three decades diverted it into a thousand fountains and when all those men and horses had gone the water flowed on and the sound of water falling echoes in the dream the dream of water in which the avenues all of them are the river on its own way CHORUS The wet bamboo clacking in the night rain crying in the darkness whimpering softly as the hollow columns touch and slide along each other swaying with the empty air these are sounds from before there were voices gestures older than grief from before there was pain as we know it the impossibly tall stems are reaching out groping and waving before longing as we think of it or loss as we are acquainted with it or feelings able to recognize the syllables that might be their own calling out to them like names in the dark telling them nothing about loss or about longing nothing ever about all that has yet to answer WHAT IS A GARDEN All day working happily down near the stream bed the light passing into the remote opalescence it \nreturns to as the year wakes toward winter a season of rain in a year already rich in rain with masked light emerging on all sides in the new leaves of the palms quietly waving time of mud and slipping and of overhearing the water under the sloped ground going on whispering as it travels time of rain thundering at night and of rocks rolling and echoing in the torrent and of looking up after noon through the high branches to see fine rain drifting across the sunlight over the valley that was abused and at last left to fill with thickets of rampant aliens bringing habits but no stories under the mango trees already vast as clouds there I keep discovering beneath the tangle the ancient shaping of water to which the light of an hour comes back as to a secret and there I planted young palms in places I had not pondered until then I imagined their roots setting out in the dark knowing without knowledge I kept trying to see them standing in that bend of the valley in the light that would come A NIGHT FRAGRANCE Now I am old enough to remember people speaking of immortality as though it were something known to exist a tangible substance that might be acquired to be used perhaps in the kitchen every day in whatever was made there forever after and they applied the word to literature and the names of things names of persons and the naming of other things for them and no doubt they repeated that word with some element of belief when they named a genus of somewhat more than a hundred species of tropical trees and shrubs some with flowers most fragrant at night for James Theodore Tabernaemontanus of Heidelberg physician and botanist highly regarded in his day over four centuries ago immortality might be like that with the scattered species continuing their various evolutions the flowers opening by day or night with no knowledge of bearing a name of anyone and their fragrance if it reminds at all not reminding of him By W.S.

his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork Productions",0.3442094326019287],["poor impulse control rebelliousness suicidal behavior truancy delinquency bad judgment drug abuse sexual indiscretion relationship problems depression eating disorders over-achievement and burn-out nightmares Stressors for Teenagers Change and Loss Move to a new home or school Change in family situation such as severation divorce sibling leaving home new baby in family Loss of special possession or pets Loss of home due to disaster or evicton Illness or Death Physical illness or injury Long -term or permanent disability Illness or death of a family member Illness or death of a friend Beginnings and Endings Beginning a new relationship Ending of a relationship Starting a new job Getting fired or layed off from a job Beginning of a new school year Graduation Getting married Becoming a parent Fear and Trauma Frightening experiences like disasters, crimes or violent events in your home, school, or community, or seen on TV Coping Responses for Teenagers Support Talking it out with some one you can trust Having friends and a safe place for emotional comfort and rest Feeling OK about whatever you are feeling and are going through Understanding Reducing fear by getting the facts and finding out what is real Understanding the normal human reactions to stress and change and the grief process Taking Control Discovering one's own strength and flexibility Being part of the solution and recovery Learning new skills through the challenges of new situations Taking Care of Yourself Participating in physical excersise and activity eating healthy foods Getting rest Avoiding self-medicating (drugs and alcohol) Getting necessary medical care Time Knowing that adjusting to change and healing from physical or emotional hurt takes time and patience Trusting that time itself is part of the healing process Faith Knowing that God loves and cares for us even in the midst of trouble Finding a faith community that prays for us and provides comfort and protection Discovering words of comfort in scripture and from Christian friends Personal Work sheet on Stress 1.",0.3437122702598572],["``We have tossed them to the bottom of the food chain because they can't do what we expect.",0.3436639606952667],["To avert bad luck when you have spilled salt, burn some of it in a fire.",0.3436512053012848]]
