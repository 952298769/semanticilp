these fungi are important decomposers parasites acquire nutrients from living organisms and cause harm to them in the process - e.g., ringworm, athlete's foot, other plant and animal pathogens) symbiotes feed on living tissue, but provide benefit to the other organism - e.g., mycorrhizae, lichens (more on this later) reproduction can take place several ways: asexually by fragmentation of hyphae via haploid, airborn spores spores are produced by hyphae often above-ground, so spores can be dispersed by \nair above-ground hyphae often form specialized reproductive structures = fruiting bodies (mushrooms, e.g.) spores may be produced either asexually, by mitosis from a single haploid parent cell sexually, by meiosis following fusion of two haploid nuclei into diploid zygote spores generally highly resistant, can stay dormant for very long time waiting for appropriate conditions for germination Biological importance of fungi Important ecological functions mycorrhizae are important plant symbionts hyphae extend into plant roots help plants extract phophate and metals from soil may also protect against root pests, pathogens plants without mycorrhizae grow more slowly than plants with them fungal decomposers help recycle nutrients within ecosystems Humansuse fungi for sources of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals for food Life cycle of Zygomycota = zygomycetes using black bread mold as example (fig 21.18 in text) note that hyphae are haploid spores are produced in special structures = sporangia sporangia are produced from hyphae both sexually and asexually asexually, sporangia are produced by mitosis sexually, follow cycle: hyphae of complementary mating strains (+ and -) meet and grow into contact with each other two haploid nuclei fuse within a specialized structure, forming a 2n zygospore zygospore undergoes meiosis and produces a sporangium (looks just like the asexual ones - difference is that all the spores will be genetically different from each other) spores released, germinate to produce new hyphae/mycelium Life cycle of Basidiomycota haploid hyphae from compatible mating types fuse and grow into mycelium nuclei from the two strains do NOT fuse cells are called dikaryotic to indicate two unfused nuclei under appropriate conditions, mycelium forms fruiting body = mushroom inside the gills are small basidia = reproductive structures in cells of basidia, the two nuclei fuse to form diploid zygote zygote undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores = basidiospores Cool fungus trivia: one of worlds largest and oldest living organisms is a fungus!",0.8024184703826904],["Types of reproduction: Asexual: Fungi reproduce asexually by forming spores .",0.8012972474098206],["Many plants reproduce use a combination of sexual and asexual reproduction to get the benefits of both methods.. by-Suzanne Agius Types of Asexual Reproduction in Plants Among the many ways that plants produce asexually are the following;",0.7981318235397339],["stolonisation Type of asexual reproduction involving the formation of stolons.",0.7899077534675598],["A common type of asexual reproduction in corals is by fragmentation.",0.7899077534675598],["A common type of asexual reproduction in corals is by fragmentation.",0.7899077534675598],["What are the different types of asexual reproduction described in the book?",0.7899077534675598],["What types of sexual and asexual reproduction occurs in the sponges?",0.7899077534675598],["A common type of asexual reproduction in corals is by fragmentation.",0.7899077534675598],["Vegetative Propagation : is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants.",0.7899077534675598],["Draw an organism undergoing each type of asexual reproduction.",0.7899077534675598],["The cells multiply by a type of asexual reproduction known as budding.",0.7899077534675598],["What are some of the different types of asexual reproduction?",0.7899077534675598],["In what types of environments might asexual reproduction be an advantage?",0.7899077534675598],["There are two type of propagation -
