find a nice sequence of fossils leading from one species to the next this is to be expected if most of the time, species stay about the same, and only occasionally do new ones form the number of individuals involved in the transition will be very few, compared to those involved in the period of stability, so the chances of finding fossils of the transitional individuals will be very low but evolutionary theory suggests some possibilities about how new species could form But first, we need two more useful concepts: character displacement and reinforcement these are not in themselves processes of speciation but they come in handy for understanding the processes of speciation that we are about to look at character displacement : a mechanism that may increase the existing differences in characteristics between two variant populations that are in competition with each other say two populations of birds have diverged considerably, such that one is well adapted to a wet environment, and the other to a dry environment if they are allowed to mix again, the dry-adapted individuals will be favored in dry areas, and the wet-adapted individuals will be favored in wet areas any wet-adapted birds who were a bit towards the dry-adapted end of their population's range of variation will have strong competition from the dry-adapted birds and vice versa that is, any individuals who happen to be more intermediate in character will be out-competed by their own kind in their native environment, and by the other kind in the other environment so individuals who tend to be intermediate in type will be selected against, and the two populations will evolve apart towards adaptations that are specialized for their own ecological niche character displacement clearly does occur in nature see the three charts on page 102 some islands have only medium ground finches, which have relatively deep beaks other islands have only small ground finches, which have relatively shallow beaks still other islands have both kinds of finches but when both kinds are present, the small ground finches have even shallower beaks and the medium ground finches have even deeper beaks that is, the characteristics that distinguish the two species are more exaggerated on islands where they live together presumed \nreason: character displacement those small finches that have beaks on the large end of their normal range are out-competed for the large seeds by the even deeper-beaked medium finches that is, they pay the costs of a small finch with a deep beak, but the other species beats them out of the benefit of getting the larger seeds so they do not survive and reproduce as well, and the average beak depth of the small finch goes down those medium finches that have beaks on the small end of their normal range are out-competed for smaller seeds by the small finches so the average beak depth of the medium finches goes up reinforcement : a mechanism that can increase the reproductive isolation between two variant populations that might still interbreed reinforcement can occur in a situation in which hybrids (offspring of matings between parents of two different types) are less successful than offspring of mates of the same type such as the case with the small finches and the medium finches, in which the hybrids lose out in competition with either purebred type in this case, selection will favor individuals who tend to mate with their own kind, and avoid mating with the other kind because they produce fewer of the less-fit hybrids, and more of the successful purebred offspring individuals who tend to mate with their own kind (and not the other kind) will produce more successful offspring those offspring will also inherit the tendency to mate with their own kind, since their parents had that preference so the tendency to mate with their own kind will become more common so eventually the populations become largely or completely isolated from each other from that point on, there is no mixing (no gene flow), so the two populations are free to evolve further off in their own directions the behavior that leads to this tendency to mate with one's own kind could be anything, as long as it has that effect it might be that the pure-breeding individuals mate at certain times of the day or year or are attracted to certain mating displays or physical features or anything else that results in their more often picking their own kind to mate with both of these processes serve to exaggerate or accelerate speciation, or help to lock-in changes that are leading to speciation we will look at three processes of speciation allopatric speciation: \"in different countries\" parapatric speciation: \"in neighboring countries\" sympatric speciation: \"in the same country\" these differ mainly in the amount of physical separation they require between the diverging populations allopatric speciation : speciation that occurs when two populations that are geographically isolated from each other diverge far enough to form distinct species \"allopatric\": \"in different countries\" that is, the two populations are separated by a physical barrier or great distance, like lizards on two different islands, or fish in two different lakes causing them to be reproductively isolated from each other if the selection pressures on the two isolated populations are different, they may evolve in different directions until the two populations are sufficiently different to be called separate species another hypothetical bird example finches from a
