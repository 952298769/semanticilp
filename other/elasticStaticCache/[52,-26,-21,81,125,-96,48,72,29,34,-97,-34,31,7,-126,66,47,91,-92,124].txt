[["Did you know that by pedaling a specially built bicycle you can change physical energy to mechanical energy to electrical energy?",1.7616194486618042],["Okay, this is a little bit bonkersâ€”so what else could we do? If your bicycle has a dynamo (a small electricity generator ) on it for powering the lights, you'll know it's harder to pedal when the dynamo is engaged than when it's switched off. That's because some of your pedalling energy is being \"stolen\" by the dynamo and turned into electrical energy in the lights. If you're going along at speed and you suddenly stop pedalling and turn on the dynamo, it'll bring you to a stop more quickly than you would normally, for the same reason: it's stealing your kinetic energy. Now imagine a bicycle with a dynamo that's 100 times bigger and more powerful. In theory, it could bring your bike to a halt relatively quickly by converting your kinetic energy into electricity, which you could store in a battery and use again later. And that's the basic idea behind regenerative brakes!",1.6031535863876343],["Motorized Bicycle Any two (2) or three (3) wheeled device having fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, or having no pedals if powered solely by electrical energy, and on automatic power, which is capable of propelling the device at a maximum speed of not more than thirty (30) miles per hour on level ground.",1.4977244138717651],["Specialized pedals, which measure forces during bicycling, were used while spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects participated in a functional electrical stimulation induced cycling program.",1.429344892501831],["In the Electrical Energy module, students explore the types of things electrical energy does.",1.4188135862350464],["He does not type, use a [personal] computer nor does he understand electricity or electrical repair.",1.383538842201233],["The Energy Bike is a bicycle-powered generator that allows students to transform their &quot;pedal power&quot; (mechanical energy) into electrical, light, heat, and sound energy and to &quot;feel and see&quot; the transformations.",1.3212145566940308],["The Energy Bike is a bicycle-powered generator that allows students to transform their &quot;pedal power&quot; (mechanical energy) into electrical, light, heat, and sound energy and to &quot;feel and see&quot; the transformations.",1.3212145566940308],["The kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms.
