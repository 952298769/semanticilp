do better watch what you think Better watch where you go cause you know he knows What's in the heart of man There's a time to sleep time to be awake There's a time to work there's a time to play Time to laugh a time to cry Time to be born were all going to die Better watch \nwhat you say Cause you know he knows what's in the heart of man We all have sinned came short of the glory There's none righteous no not one If I say I have no sin call me a liar Better watch what you do cause he knows where you been Hand me down Religion He'd been saved all his life Been brought up on the lie His Father's Father reserved him a place On the front row of saving grace Said he couldn't kneel Cause his suit was too tight He been heard praying sometimes But he's never saw the light He got hand me down, hand me down Hand me down religion He said the church has no business Tampering with a man's soul Cause he swears their ain't no devil Down in no big black hole If the devil doesn't exist If he's a creation of man Then man created the devil In his own image with his own hands Had a cigar in his mouth But he said he didn't smoke Had shoes on his feet But you didn't see him walk Slung cards like throwing knives But you never saw them stick Carried a pearl handled pistol But you never heard the hammer click Said he don't go to church to be preached at He got hand me down religion Business as usual His mouth as dry as a sack of flour Dusty as a lizards back Sitting on the davenport Fishing a cufflinks from a crack He sported two bellies One high one low Held his pants with a diaper pen Never let his pride show Chorus Some say he had his own teeth But I seen him slip'em in and out Jackolantern smile With a head full of cabbage in his mouth Played his nose like harmonica Hair in need of an oil change Smoked ox blood through chicken bones Used god's name in vain Chorus birds nest portland hair He knew she was trailer park trash Barley sky gave him a Pumpernickel rash Chorus Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Heard the sound of rain Dripping from a tin roof into a can of lard Like a tad pole on a dry rivers bed Took a swim to the nearest star I would be president but I'm not without sin You rode the bus while I jumped the fence Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Lived in a shotgun house Close to the tracks Spray painted your name On the over pass Is there grace without gravity faith for the blind The barns are raising the devils killing time I was a writer before I could speak And I spoke before I could think I've stopped to hear a still small voice Giving me freedom Giving me a choice Between the devil and the deep blue sea With jaundiced eyes on the road to perdition Always kept his powder dry All is fair in love and war Pursuing the apple of his eye Between you, me and the lamppost She was dressed to the nines But she tired men with her idle chit chat Not one word worth a cold thin dime Between the devil and the deep blue sea Every cloud has a silver lining Every ocean has a green eyed monster Dyed in the wool and still shinning Feet of clay and a pair of purple valentines Gave him the slip on weaver's run She's running with the hair hunting with the hounds With a slender reed the cat's on the prowl She became penny wise and pound foolish Couldn't make a silk purse out of a sows ear Living in clover squeezing blood from a turnip In a blue funk crying crocodile tears Left no stone unturned smart as a whip More than one way to skin a cat Spit and polish spic and span Bull in the china shop is wearing a brass hat He bought her love for a song She couldn't see the forest for the tree's Half a loaf is better than none Bought a pig in a poke with a head full of steam Action speaks louder than words Cut off her nose with a fish hook to spit her face Heaping coals of fire upon her head She's a millstone around his neck She threw the baby out with the bath water And put bats in the belfry Hell is paved with good intentions And a month of sunday's Don't you judge the preacher Don't call me good, there's only one that's good Jesus came to save sinners of which I am the worst (Drums kick in) Don't you judge the preacher The preacher he is judge God called preaching folly So don't you hold a grudge If you don't have the faith You can't understand it If you have the faith Nothing left to explain I have died to sin Used to walk in these ways Truth are in the headlines At the bottom of a bird cage Had my oxen in a ditch Jesus wept Sunday's turning black The rocks cry out Road Less Traveled The snow fell like butterflies The air was bitter cold I crossed the sugar tree field Warmed my bones in a worm hole Fire by night cloud by day I don't regret one minute along the way When the evening sun Starts sinking low I count my many blessings upon the road Many lay by the way side Cuz the journey is long Lost in their aching heart is desire to move on Road less traveled Jesus lead me home Good morning mule skinner I'm going to move on Mocking bird be singing That I'm not alone When I enter that city paved with gold Pearly gates going to \nopen take me to my home Sky opened up Latter rain began to fall Ushering in the crops As the willows are tall Down by the waters course Remember from where I came Dip my hat in the pool I must be on my way The Last Song Make the Mississippi run backwards Flood waters are going to crest Going to flood the old devil Can't give him no rest The devil going to be running Like a Jack Rabbit out of New Orleans High tail'n it up north That's where he outta be Got to resist his temptations Stomp him under your feet Sun is going to shine on the cotton fields The day that ol' serpent leaves Don't drink from the devils troft He's the father of lies Leaving a trail on the river banks Swore I seen mud in his eye Greater is He that is in me Than he that is in the world Who'll bell the cat A boon companion Promised a chicken in every pot Feast or famine deep six or starve Burning the candle at both ends Crossed the rubicon Nervous tic pulled at the corner of his mouth Jumping like a big mouth bass down south Chorus Light at the end of the tunnel Became a runaway train Wearing jack boots like a gestapo When it pours it rains Fall on stony ground trampled under foot The fats in the fire cats on a hot tin roof Chorus Down at the beauty parlor They gave her a permanent fit Her hair looks like something You'd pound meat with Her hub cap eyes looked at him like a t-bone Like a wild horse stampede But he had loosed his demons And his spirit been set free One Man's Opinion Lost in the Canopy of tree's he never had horse sense Oaks and Pines cap off the skies he wandered through the circus tent Before the eyes of God tried squeezing through a needles eye The world is a small place every face tells a lie He drank a gallon of embalming fluid which kept him in the stir When your full of Helium best keep your shoes on and your thoughts pure Forest is a poachers paridise and the squirrels jumping from the tree's Nose as red as a tomato livers spotted with disease The way he plays the game it's never a game of chance Took him many a year to learn this side step dance It's a nice day but that's just One Man's Opinion Nosey Parker with her little acorn going to plant a mighty oak tree in her neighbors yard Weed benders always ready to run him out on the rail But the checker players like the tales he tells They seem to want bad news and they always want more He said he'll sleep it off and in the morning shove it under the door Who walked over his tongue with their muddy shoes Bending and twisting to shake the snapping turtle loose Never met Jesus the Son of man waking up civilized In the pine cones in Birmingham Concert in the Park recorded live 8-22-96 Ain't no Devil The fellow was familiar with Bulldogs and Water hoses With coat hanger shoulders and a silver spoon in his mouth With a pocket of fools gold Ingenuity and elbow grease He got a $50 Erie Root Canal Killed the pain with a bottle dipped from the Hudson Gave his liver an eviction note With corn rolls on his head like a big black widow He rode the stick horse derby mounted on a goat Readers Digest and a T.V. guide is all the bible he ever read Captain Marvel and Wonder Women the mom and dad he never had On a dark Kentucky night about to take a bullet in the back He saw Jesus standing there by the caution sign Ain't no devil in the fiery furnace in the burning bush In the lions den pushing this pen Going to raise the dead sleeping in my bed Going to open blind eyes can satisfy At the pearly gates walking on the lake On the mountain top going to steal and rob By the river side going to baptize Going to dry those eyes ain't no devil going to crash them skies It all came crashing down timber tumbled to the ground With a tobacco tan he climbed thin air Life's too short to box with God promised he would not spare the rod Surrendered to Jesus in the back of a Corvair Ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's all I have But sometimes she makes me sad When i'm tempted by her skin I got a girl she looks so fine But she wants too much of my time When i'm tempted by her hair Chorus I love Jesus more than I love you Cause he ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's first class But sometimes she goes too fast When i'm tempted by the speed If I plant a tree If I plant a tree today I may never sit under its shade But I look at the dirt on my hands And I wonder why God made man I hold my sons in my arms Could I send them away to war I see the trust in their eyes And I wander if God cries I look up at the stars And I wonder where you are Are you looking back down at me Your as far as the eye can see It must have been some sacrifice Ask your son to give his life There is no greater love that I know Cause a father don't want to let go Bombay taxi horn Looking classy in \nhis zoot suit Passing counterfeit bills and paste Backside numb in a water melon truck Couldn't wipe that smile off of his face He was as thin as a dollar bill Like a muckraker slinging mud on capital hill didn't want to die in anyone else's war A gum ball kid with a bombay taxi horn Eyes that look into the here after Heads tilted back and noses pinched There's only two ways to come out from the front on a stretcher or stiff in a flag draped trunk He was a fugitive long shore sailor Drifting with a bald headed friend Taking the jitney down broadway Trying to hide the whiskers on his chin The motel The day was long like a servant of hell Couldn't keep the flies away sweat dripping from the window seal Someone is coveting his brother's spanish wife Better cut the barrel short and sleep with a knife There are no picket fences in this dreary town Only bad guys, dirty cops, and dice throwing blood hounds Kiss the gunners daughter I heard someone scream A radio drowned out the sounds of a melting summers dream Lemonade on ice just pour it on my brow Water pipes a clanging to the sounds of a hoot owl I hear a baby crying but mums a baritone The father did a dry dive many moons ago T.v. a glowing in the window across the street Like a bleached desert bone but I got to get to sleep My head is a throbbing like an axe squeezing a stroke Across the hall the boards are squeaking as a man kicks and chokes Then it starts a raining I scatter the buckets and pans Smell of wet dogs, and cigarettes, fish heads and garbage cans Hotel sign a flickering like a neon typhoon Pack me in ice wash off that cheap french perfume Cannot rest your eyes when you hear a fly swat banjo

been rain/ but we chose to risk the section of unsealed road along the bottom end of the cape york penninsula/ to view the queensland peppermint & river red gum landscape/ & its constant expansion into kilometres of giant plateaus & underground lava tunnels from extinct volcanoes/ we chose to widen our knowledge of roadside brolgas & dumped dogs like hitchhikers waiting for a lift/ after light rain the normanton road had expanded out into side lanes/ into large bottomless pits deep & soft with mud/ new bitumen strips stood high & dry in the middle/ with access to them blocked by roadwork signs/ a couple of tourists from holland took the detours & ended up bogged up to the windows/ their white arms waving from cars with mud pouring in/ 8888888888888888888888 on another lonely stretch a man was trying to gas himself inside his old bomb car with his german shepherd/ the dog s horrible barking brought us to a halt/ i got out to see what was the matter/ & his car door flew open & he took off into the bush with his german shepherd following him/ the dog s hysteria being released like exhaust fumes into the stunted growth/ on a very muddy section on which the e.h. holden was skating/ we came across a muscular black dog sitting on the side of the road/ it watched us pass noticing our dogs in the back/ we slowed down without stopping & i pushed my door open with my foot/ i called out: come on come on/ & the big black dog slid through mud/ it jumped onto my lap/ its wagging tail slapping my chest & face/ the bright orange clay flicking up onto the vinyl ceiling & interior light/ 8888888888888888 adrian said: perhaps we should go onto some properties & try to look for the owner/ i said: no/ as harshly as if i had slammed my foot onto the brakes/ there were hundreds of properties out there hidden in the scrub/ amongst drowned coolibah trees & sharp topaz jutting out/ i suggested we stick to the road & drive straight to croydon/ when we got into town we filled the tank with petrol/ then i went to the local shire building & the town clerk tied the dog up to the flagpole/ then a carload of locals drove past/ two wheels of the mud splashed ute jumping up over the gutter/ ripping into the sprinkler greened lawn/ the full round spotlight dangling crazily from the roof & the wire caged section on the back mingling with lunatic dogs/ in the front were thin-lipped australians with deep squinting eyes, checked shirts & dusty hats/ the chain rattled on the flagpole as the dog began to gyrate/ diesel, one cried out/ so that the dog stood to attention & became darker/ then he hopped out of the ute & came up & shook my hand/ the others observing me through the window glass/ i could tell he would be the type to keep his distance under normal circumstances/ but he offered me reward money/ i didn t want any/ i saw diesel washed clean by a brief shower & enthusiastic stroking from her owner/ then her black shining loaded into the back with the other dogs/ he said that she had been missing for two days/ & that they were heading back out into the scrub/ these men are pig killers, i thought/ & compared my dogs lives to theirs/ i was pleased to have found their thick- jawed dog/ but i thought of the dead black pigs torn at the throat/ out there behind the bloodwood & paperbarks in the queensland scrub/ tusks turned upwards drinking in rain/ dried blood & the long lashed eyes half-buried in mud On the Back of the Ute panorama and dog saliva, we are leaving the property behind, to reflect upon itself in the grey flood water, we are heading into town, to do some simple shopping and have a quiet drink, i m watching the world go by, the winter sun filtering down, roughed -up and wind-blown, on the back of the ute, splinters of rock press up through the soil, kangaroos decide to hop away, as the dogs and i take in the stream \nof bush, we are blind to details, continually letting go, over every second of road, we are life-sized, our heads in the sky, the shreded exhaust and retreads roaring, bumps and potholes, patches of bulldust, the vibration of corrugation, an 80km per hour wind to howl and rattle collars, the high sun to heat my arm against metal, and a hat pushed on with my other hand, in case the big gale lifts it sideways, washaways, causeways, cattle grids, floodways, long orange trails leading inland and twisty dirt roads to stick to, each side moves in blurs to a triangle, to the centre of the back of the ute, my hair stuck to my cheeks, across my lips as it moves to its triangular point, skyline river gums closing in behind us, gravel stones smashing up against the diff, we are affected by the surface, by what we skim along, we re air-born, throwing up dust, beers are handed back from the driver, the rough ride and shouting giving us presence, the dogs put down their tongues and pant, tails steering their clumsy excitement, in motion from one side to the other, over the spare tyre and a greasy rope, holding fast to the paintwork, so as not to be left behind, which is important, as every property dog knows, when we go into town, to buy the newspaper and put on lotto, then if one should fall, well, i can t get a grip on any of them, in this way we are here to be ourselves, on the old green canvas and a backpack, in the back of the ute, bumping along the queensland border near collerina, we define boundaries by what we cross and choose to see, the bitumen or the tricky dust, an early star, a paper daisy, a gutted rusted holden bomb, fencelines and telstra wire, galahs lifting into the sky, 1000 galahs, now pink now grey, they are free to change direction, our winds from wing and tarp collide, we both lift up, combine and separate, moving ute and native birds, foraging for sustenance out back.",0.6907157897949219],["If you want to make a pond without a plastic liner, puddle wet clay soil with your feet, Ive seen many landscapers use this technique,

this defeat I think few men had Stronger Ideas of their bravery and disregard of fear than I had but standing on a bear and open sand \nbarr to be shot at from behind a picketed Indian village was more than I had contacted for and some what cooled my courage before leaving the grave of my friend Gibson that before I had an oppertunity of writeing to his friends I forgot his post office and so never have writen We fell down a few miles and lay by several day to wait and if any more men had escaped the buthery when on the third or fourth day Jack Larisson came to us naked as when he was born and the skin peeling off of him from the effects of the sun he was wounded a ball passing through the fleshy part of one thigh and ldging in the other the ball was easily exticated and in a few (a few) days he was hobbling around Larrisson had lain between two dead horses untill the boats left and he saw no other chance of escape but to swim the river then divesting himself of all his clothing he took the water the Indians came running and firing at his head but escaped without further injury the wound Before mentioned he had recieved in the early part of the battle if it can be called Battle supposing no more men had survived the slaughte we again droped down the river \"And landed under the side of an Isle and two men ware sent up to the mouth of the yellowstone and one boat containing the wounded and discouraged was sent down to Council bluffs with orders to continue to St Louis This being the fore part of June here we lay for Six weeks or two months living on scant and frquentle no rations allthough game was plenty on the main Shore perhaps it was my fault in greate measure for several of us being allowed to go on Shore we ware luckey enough to get Several Elk each one packing meat to his utmost capacity there came on a brisk shower of rain Just before we reached the main shore and a brisk wind arising the men on the (men on the) boat would not bring the skiff and take us on board the bank being bear and no timber neare we ware suffering with wet and cold I went off to the nearest timber made a fire dried and warmed myself laid down and went to sleep in the morning looking around I saw a fine Buck in easy gun shot and I suceeded in Killing him then I was in town plenty of wood plenty of water and plenty of nice fat venison nothing to do but cook and eat here I remained untill next morning then taking a good back load to the landing whare I met several men who had Just landed for the purpose of hunting for me after this I was scarcely ever allowed to go ashore for I might never return \"In proceess of time news came that Col. Livenworth with Seven or eight hundred Sioux Indians ware on the rout to Punnish the Arrickarees and (18) or (20) men came down from the Yellow Stone who had gone up the year prevous these men came in Canoes (came in canoes) and passed the Arrickarees in the night we ware now landed on the main Shore and allowed more liberty than hertofore (at) Col. Levenworth about (150) men the remnant of the (6) Regiment came and Shortly after Major Pilcher with the Sioux Indians (Indians) amounting to 5 or 600 warriers and (18) or 20 engagies of the Missourie furr Company and a grand feast was held and speeches made by whites and Indians \"After 2 days talk a feast and an Indian dance we proceded up stream Some time toward the last of August we came near the arrickaree villages again a halt was made arms examined amunition distributed and badges given to our friends the Sioux which consisted of a strip of white muslin bound around the head to distinguish friends from foes \"The third day in the afternoon being 2 or three miles from the villages the Sioux made a breake being generally mounted they out went us although we ware put to the double Quick and when we arived the plain was covered with Indians which looked more like a swarm bees than a battle field they going in all possible directions the Rees having mounted and met the Sioux a half mile from their pickets But as soon as we came in sight the Rees retreated into their village the boats came up and landed a short half mile below the village but little efort was mad that afternoon except to surround the Rees and keep them from leaveing the Sioux coming around one side and the whites around the other Quite a number of dead Indians streued over the plain I must here notice the Bravery of one Sioux a Ree ventured out some distance from the pickets and held some tantalizeing conversation with the Sioux, one Siox on a fast horse approached him slowly Still bantering each other to approach nearer at length the Sioux Put whip to his horse taking directly for the Ree and run him right up to the then firing at full speed wheeled to \nretreat the Rees inside of the pickets firing some 40 or 50 of them covered him completely in smoke but Sioux and his horse came out safe and the Rees horse went in through the gate without a rider the Rees friends came out and carried in the man Several Rees lay dead and one in long shot (shot) of the pickets the old Sioux chief Brought one of his wives up with a war club who struck the corps a number of blow with club he tantalizeing the Rees all the time for their cowardice in comeing out to defend thair dead comrad and allowing his Squaws to strike their braves in gunshot of their village a common habit of the Indians in war is the first man that comes to the body of a dead enemy is to take his Scalp the second will take off his right hand the third his left the fourth his right foot the fifth his Left foot and hang thes trophies around their necks to shew how near they ware to the death of their enemy on the field of Battle and in this case a member of our Sioux shewed Trophies one more circumstance and I am done one large middle aged Sioux blonged to the grizzle Bear medicine came on hand feet to the body of a dead Ree in the attitude of a grzzly Bear snorting and mimican the bear in all his most vicious attitudes and with his teeth tore out mouth fulls of flesh from the breast of the dead body of the Ree \"But I will not tire you with details of the savage habits of Indians to their enimies but I will merely state that it is easy to make a savage of a civilised man but impossible to make a civilised man of a savage in one Generation \"The third day in the afternoon one of the Ree chiefs came out alone offering terms of peace a Schedule was drawn up to be confirmed on the morrow in a half hour after this was undestood our Sioux packed up and ware out of sight also the most of the Missourie companies men \"The night was Quiet but the two previous we had a lively picture of pandimonium the waing of squaws and children the Screams and yelling of men the fireing of guns the awful howling of dogs the neighing and braying of hosses and mules with the hooting of owls of which thy a number all intermingled with the stench of dead men and horses made the place the most (most) disagreeable that immaginnation could fix Short of the bottomless pit In the morning however our Quiet night was easily accounted for the Rees having dserted thair village early in the night previous a few men with an Interpeter ware sent forward to hunt them up and bring them back they returned about noon not being able to overtake them one circumstanc I must not omit to mention Captain Riley since General Riley who gave California her constituon was present and in command of company of Company A..6th Regiment and requested pemition to lead a forlorn hope into the villag but was denied that honour he then became allmost furious and swore that he demande the prviledge stating that they had been laying at garison at Council Bluffs for 8 or 10 years doeing nothing but eating pumpkins and now a small chance for promotion occured and it was denied him and might not occurr again for the next 10 yeares (again) \"We Remained one night more in our stinking disageeable camp when we
