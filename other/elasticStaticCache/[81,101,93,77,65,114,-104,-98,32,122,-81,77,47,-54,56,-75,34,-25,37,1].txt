surprised to find that I was not alone For the trail was marked with tracks and tears And in my ears I heard the drone Of the wind that bore the wails Of every woman time had crossed And it spoke about the lives of all the wives Who wept and loved and lost The women of the widow's peak Told me the days were always long They said, \"oh, that climb can kill you, child But in the end it makes you strong it will bear down on your womb And burn a hole into your breast But you will still go on when your lover's gone And you will live and lay his soul to rest\" I dreamed I climbed the widow's peak

over the last 2 decades - after I had a tri &amp; a cat - then a traditional proa with a outrigger float on it a 23` &amp; a 31`have proven themselfs now for over 4 winters sailing the strait of gibraltar &amp; such in bft 10 - sailing off a beach with breaking waves so high as the boat is wide then surfing back in &amp; landing on the beach again anchoring with 1/4&quot; nylon rode &amp; a 5lbs anchor in a white squall beating out off marina bay towards the west when the whole bay of gibraltar was white I have been so convinced of it now - that I have started a 78`already the idea behind the concept is the following - have a boat as long as possible for comfort underway &amp; anchoring - because one can anchor almost anywhere there is no need to go into a marina meaning there is no need to have an engine - having total control under sails alone ( you can turn on the spot - go both ways - ( standby &amp; check things anytime ) - having good cruising speeds with as little as possible of an sailarea - 1000sf / 78` - no need to reef or change sails up to 8 bft - beating - 10 running - to be safe from any breaking freak wave or gust the proa today modern proas can do a lot of things - the polynesians could only dream about - the outriger sailboat of today - is non capsizeable - fast to change direction -safe to manoever even in thight spots - can any time go on stand by - to look around and see what`s going on - turn on the spot - like with a twin engine power boat - to land on most beaches - leave again - without turnig the boat - they have - once underway - no leeway it all - and all this - with a boat - that weighs only one half of a catamaran - has only 2 small ruders - 360 - on the windward side of the mainhull - no turning or moving mast - no dagger - center - steeringboards - nothing more to move \nor control - exept the sheets for the sails - generel requirements - for good performance - hard on the wind - you need not only little resistence through the water - but little aerodynamic resistence from the waterlinie on up as well that is why the crew is seated inside the boat - ( 1 ) the bridgedeck is aero dynamically shaped - ( 8 ) and up to about 30` loa ( 13`wide ) because it is lighter then - one piece - can be trailered high up - sailing the proa - standing by - changing directions - you are sitting broadside to the wind in your boat - the sails are lose - you are drifting slowly to leeward - you pull on a sheet - the boat moves in that direction - it`s that easy with the windward sail - ( 3 ) you even can turn on the spot - with the main * you go to the right - with the windward sail to the left -with the roller jibs ( 2 - these are just sails on a tube on the stay - control line ( 2 ) going from the top of the tube to the other - so if you pull one roller open - it closes the other automatically ) you can make the boat fall away from the wind - with the main sail you shot up to the wind - make the boat selfsteer - * the main ( 5 ) ist on a mast with slides to leeward - ( 4 ) so without having a turning mast - you have a clear flow on the leeward side s teering is by 2 fin ruders - 45 on the side of the main hull - ( 7 ) so you can beached most anywhere - without damaging them - or having to pull them up - they are controled by your feet - slings in the lines going to the bell crank on the balanced ruders so they can turn which ever way they want to - left &amp; right acually - you do not need them - because the boat can be steered by itself - depending on the sail setting - exept in large waves &amp; swells it makes for a nicer - straiter sailing - if you have the ruders - bow &amp; stern - --------------------- the self leveling - 2 stage fin - ( 6 ) sailforces + the windforces on the boat combine to create a center of windforces somewhere 1/3 up the mast - if now you have an angled fin to windward - you have a means to counteracting these forces - -- you could put the fin to leeward and lift the outrigger - but you would have the same problems as a trimaran - diagonal capsize in waves large enough - -- you would have very unstabil boat - like it is very easy to hang up a pendulum - but try to stand it up alone - further more - imagine a freak wave - hiting the boat side ways - with the present setup - you have no wory it all - ( just make sure the structure holds up ) but the other setup is doomed - before the wave even hits - that is why - in such conditions - you do not want to let the wind &amp; waves be on the wrong side - ever - now - if the outrigger wants to come out of the water - the fin`s lower part pulls it down - when the outrigger wants to go down into the water - the upper part of the fin lowers the vector more to the horizontal - making the outrigger want to come up - changes in bouancy of the fin helps in each case - if - as some have told me - the fin would come out of the water through wave dynamics - as it never has with this configuration - then the center of lateral action moves violently forward - the boat shots up into the wind I have tried this on a model without the lower part of the fin on it - fritz roth ------------------------------------------------- fritz.roth@proadesign.com we have now finished the design of a 2 mast proa - with a cockpit that is larger - because it is between the masts - it should even better selfsteer then the 1 mast version - and can be totally sailed without the roller jib - before the wind the forward mast sail can be sheeted in a backward beating position - because the jib is not needed in a storm it all - it can be much larger for light air performance - because they are on a stay 15 to leeward - they do not back wind the mast sail - fritz.roth@proadesign.com --------------------------------- 2 mast proa and here is a 3 mast version - it has the same mast sail area as the 2 mast - but a lower center of effort - it seams this set up would be the choice on

will lead us to the higher ground One day every heart will beat strong against the night Let it be done right now Once there was a man, and his words became a song of love And his song became the golden dream One Love is the light, shining over everyone that believes It will lead us to the higher ground One day every eye will see truth before the light Let it be done right now Some wait, so long Because our love is strong This hard road traveled on Will lead us home, forever Hear the lion's song, voices cryin' like a desert wind Yeh he's gone unto his father's land Afrika tonight, for we truly are one in our hearts Colors woven in the golden dream One day every eye will see truth before the light Let it be done right now One day every voice will speak strong against the night Let us be one right now So let it be We are \nthe children of a thousand days We are the people of the hard rain We are the children of a thousand days We are the people of the hard rain We are the people of

like a diamond I suppose Though in the rough and off the beaten path I sparkle sleepless in the dead of night Because I know this is the way I chose I am the toughest thing there's ever been My edges slice through every obstacle And I can not be scratched but by myself A mistake that I will never make again A diamond is perfection in some eyes But I know that perfection can't exist As long as

meet the land We see the waves coming We see them going It was a long walk to this beach Longer than we thought She has to make a call, to say we might be late But first we eat our meal Sandwiches and chips and soda Meager, but we didn't come for food I will be going soon I have to see the ocean The one that greeted the sailors with calm Once they rounded the Cape of Storms They found their new ocean a haven They named it Mar Pacifico I will be on my own voyage soon I must return to the place I call home My sense of home is somewhat split now My sky and hers are not the same I can end this later, but I have my duties now I want to see Mar Pacifico Before my own storms come I go down to the water's edge The wave surprise me, drench me I am soaked with the playful spray of peaceful water The sun is sinking faster She must go make her call I wait upon the blanket The breeze is strong and chills a bit The sun is sinking faster now It doesn't help as much I hope she will get back in time to see this sight with me I know she'll be here once I'm gone But she wants this once with me I want to see this once with her To look out upon the haven they named Mar Pacifico And watch a day end by her side My fears are realized The sun sinks farther down I do not hear her laughter I do not feel her hand upon my own I must look out alone Upon this thing they named Mar Pacifico While I shiver in my solitude and guilt I have no love to hold for warmth She had to make her call And I am wondering if I could have changed this The sun goes down and still she is not here I stand and pace and sit again to stay out of the wind And then I feel her hand upon my shoulder, I look up I see her eyes dart to the horizon and the tradition we missed It is one we never shared before We wanted to share it above this ocean The one upon whose beach she now cries The one from whose beach I must carry her weary body as she sobs The sore and weary body she drove \non the long walk to witness the passing of the day with me Over this ocean Strange They named it Mar Pacifico This sea of peace Nature's perverted peace Where summer's last breeze blows cold across the tired on the beach There will be another sunset There will be another day But there will be too many more that I'm away But someday I'll return Again we'll take a walk Next time she won't need to make a call And we can watch the passing of

he seeks Knowing that he must make this trip far away to the sacred peaks He bids farewell to his friends, children and to the maiden he loves so much Knowing that for a while he will not have their advice or her gently touch After packing his pack and making ready all his weapons he mounts his pony His sons mounting with him to accompany him for the first part of his journey A hawk circles the camp and he looks up at this emblem as a good sign Smiling at his sons and trusting them to take care of their mother for a time They ride toward the mountains that are almost lost in the morning mist He knowing for a long time that he has needed to make such a journey as this Light of heart now that he is finally on his way to discover what the spirits need His sons solemnly escorting their father as they ride on their trusted steeds Til finally at mid day they wheel and return back to camp waiving as he rides away Knowing that their is a good chance that he will come back changed from this day He rides along at an easy pace headed toward the mountain of thunder so far ahead Knowing it will take many days until he reaches this most sacred of places to make his bed He hunts as he goes gathering food to preserve the food he has carried this far Knowing that he will be sleeping alone that night dreaming as he looks up at his star Since early youth he has had one star above in the beauty of the night that has been his Knowing that it one of his ancestors that watches over him a smile to it he gives The evening dusk is coming and as the stars start to appear in the heavens above He finds his star and asks the spirit of his ancestor to keep safe the one s that he loves Making camp for the night and laying down near his pony next to a stream entering a lake He looks in the distance at the mighty mountain and the journey so far he must take In fever dreams has he seen this mountain with lightening covering its head like a wreath As the spirits of the world dance into the night he lays down seeking a special peace His dreams turn to the mountain ahead and he feels that his journey has been started right He wakes with the early light and he watches his star above in the finality of the night Rising to look ahead at his journey today, he watches as a hawk toward the mountains flies Knowing that this is an omen to him and that in that direction his destiny lies He rises and mounts his pony and following his omen that circles far about in the sky Watching the hawk as it circles high above and seeing something swoops near by As he rides through \nthe stillness of the morning and watches nature as it is in full bloom He watches in the far distance as a thunderstorm builds with flashes and booms The electricity is building in the air as his hair on his arms stands straight up on end He searches the horizon for a place that he might seek shelter in In the near distance is a group of rocks that he has been told of before Knowing that a cave exists near the finger rock from legends past down from lore He rides to this sanctuary to escape from the building storm of the day His horse nervous as the approaching storm comes fastly to darken its way The storm strikes just before they reach the rocks and the lightning strikes around Knowing that to ensure that he is save he must seek shelter below ground He finds the cave that has given shelter to many in the past Glad to get out of the storm with his horse at last This is the mother of all storms as the lightning dances through the sky The thunder roars with crashes and the wind sings as it goes by This warrior stands at the entrance to the cave and stares at these spirits as they roar Knowing that his heart and his soul goes up to them and his heart does soar This is a powerful omen he feels as he makes this trip to seek out his spirit dream Knowing that his heart and his soul are making the journey of their life is seems That he will find some special meaning and purpose of life from this journey He watches as a lightning bolt strikes the rock needle he sinks to his knee For the bolt has shattered part of the rock and sent it crashing there at his feet He picks up the rock and must shift it from hand to hand because of its heat This totem of his journey he examines with wonder on his face Knowing that he was brought for some reason to this time and place As the storm passes he goes forth to continue his journey to the mountains nearby He has his totem safely tucked in his pack that bounces up and down on his thigh Reminding him as he gets closer and closer each day to the mountain rising above That he is a warrior of the people blessed with vision, happiness and love He rides through each day and watches the movement of the life surrounding him Taking in the bounty of nature for his needs as he sees fit or at his whim Ever watchful of the need to be prepared for any danger that might occur He is one day going to a small glen attacked by a wolverine and takes its fur He laughs as he thinks of the wolverine attacking in its crazed fever of hate Knowing that something had probably killed its offspring and mate He searches and finds that a wolf pack has killed the mate and ravished the den He finds that a small pup has survived and he picks it up and carries it with him Feeling a kin to this savage creature of nature that has fought to survive Glad that he is able to watch over it and keep it alive This journey of his he finds is much more than he had ever dreamed Just getting to his appointed place has brought him such wonder it seems That what should take place there must be truly wonderful and grand Because of the things that have happened to him as he crosses the land Entering the foothills he looks up to the peak far above and the clouds that cover its peaks Knowing that finally he is approaching the place of his forefathers and the knowledge it keeps On his final day he goes up the steep mountain drawing his horse behind him up the path Til he reaches the meadow so high that his people have come to so many times in the past And hobbling his horse and feeding the wolverine and finding a safe place for it to stay He climbs the rock face to the high ledge that his ancestors have come to so many times like today He checks his totem in his pack and looks out onto the valley below as he starts to pray He voice carries out over the valley echoing around its walls and coming back to stay The light flashes on the rocks as the birds ride high on the winds looking down at him He searches out his spirit that has come down through the years time and time again And as the light slowly leaves the day, he feels the spirit as it comes to him there A hand seems to touch his shoulder as he sings his song with a voice so fair The spirit seems to meld with him and join in the song of their ancestors they sing Their voices soaring and echoing across the valley he feels like he is in a dream He welcomes this spirit that has come down to him across time and space Joining him here in the place of his ancestors he has a gentle smile on his face He sings and sings as his spirit joins with this one from so far, far away His voice reaching out in the sunset as it sinks behind the horizon for the day Into the night his voice carries on as the full moon rises far into the sky at last The spirit and him communing as his mind melds with the things of the past Knowing that this moment is special to him that he will carry down though his life Too soon must this wonderful moment pass and he will go back to pain and strife But for this special night he and the spirit joined in voice, body \nand heart These memories will go with him down through the years he knew from the start That this journey to find his spirit was what he had dreamt of many a night Now that he is here with the moon shining above with its eerie light The spirit and him joined as one to celebrate passing of the dream down again Knowing that one day his son will come to this place when he is old enough and can The song carries on through the night until the sun rises once again over the rim At the last the gentle murmur of the song can only be heard close to him Slowly the spirit leaves him with a final touch on his shoulder and he opens his eyes Feeling the totem that is in his pack and touching his thighs He takes it out and sees that the morning sun shines so brightly against its face Knowing that for him he has been her and learned of his spirit in this place He smiles and rises to go down and return to his people down far below Happy and pleased that he came here to meet his spirit and have it show His horse and the wolverine are happy to see his return and he quickly mounts Anxious to go back to the people so that he can give them his account That a warrior from the people can be filled with the spirit of those who came before Now happy and pleased he goes back to his people filled with wonder and lore This warrior has learned that his heart and spirit they are as one with this place He smiles and looks up to the ledge where he spent a special night of grace Select the book to turn the page to my next part of my

this very moment and time I have found happiness if just for a while The light in the sky is gentle and soft as the cool breeze cools the day from the heat I know that this kind of time \nis precious, wonderful and very hard to keep My mind wanders back across time to the things I have seen and at some I sigh Wondering why that these precious moments are too far and few between as I look up at the sky A hawk is flying on the breeze riding the updrafts from the heat of the day I know that each of us need these moments to bring a balance into our life in some way I have seen times that have made my heart sad and carry them down through the years Knowing that perhaps things could have been different and not given me so many tears But I am the total of everything that has brought me to this place in time and to this place So I smile for a moment realizing that perhaps it was meant for me because I am a member of the human race Memories are something that each of us bring down through time whether bitter or sweet Thinking back on them I smile and am sad at some because I could not change them to something neat But in the balance I know that whatever life throws at me I have managed to survive and yes to find happiness Finding someone who will touch me for a moment and smile as she gives me a soft and tender caress As the wind dies and stillness envelopes the land I feel the evening of this day as it touches me softly in some way Knowing that at this moment there is such pain in the world at places I enjoy my peace that I have on this day Life is something that each of us clings to as we go down through the years searching and yearning for something we do not know When perhaps we can find it if we just open our hearts to ourselves and slow down for a moment and then this will perhaps show Sitting and pondering the evening as the day draws to a close I know that tenderness and caring is what each of us needs Wondering why it is something that is so scarce between people who have such a capacity for love and wonderful good deeds I think of the hustle and bustle of days gone past when I could have taken a moment and just listened to my heart and soul Knowing that I have missed so much in not doing this simple thing makes me wonder how many others are trapped because they refuse to let go We search and strive, working harder and harder and in the end what do some people find except loneliness and despair makes me wonder why Material things are just a means of comfort not something that will bring them happiness, when perhaps all they need to look at is

and then they would have found That what they have been taught all their life about reaching and striving for materials is something they missed when they failed to look around Perhaps that is why some people when they watch movies or television finds the emptiness that they feel inside hurts them so much Knowing that they will not find what the actors have and needing and wanting it to be theirs for just a moment and searching for that sweet touch The things that they see take them out of their lives for just a moment because they want what they see so very much Looking and searching for someone who will love them and look into their eyes and give them a tender touch Then rushing back into the world they think that money will buy this for them because that is what they have been

makes me think of how people can not stop to watch this in there mad rush through life I wonder why we have not been taught to stop for a moment from time to time to enjoy life then perhaps we would be happy and without strife I wonder if perhaps there are places in the world where parents take their children out to watch a sunset and just sit and enjoy it for a while Teaching them from when they are very young that this is something that they can not buy and something which perhaps will bring them a smile Man even in his leisure strives to be bigger, better, faster and quicker when perhaps it

race So as you read these simple words I ask of you to look at your life for a moment and perhaps you shall see that for you this might be the case Take yourself out for a moment when you can and sit

it will make you smile If you get a chance think of a poem you \nread one day that sent you out to find a quiet moment in your life and think of a man far away for a while Sitting in the evening air watching the sun as it sinks into the horizon we are brought closer together for a moment and you might smile Knowing that someone took the time to bring you to this wonderful moment and that you

The light in the sky is gentle and soft as the cool breeze cools the day from the heat I know that this kind of time is precious, wonderful and very hard to keep My mind wanders back across time to the things I have seen and at some I sigh Wondering why that these precious moments are too far and few between as I look up at the sky A hawk is flying on the breeze riding the updrafts from the heat of the day I know that each of us need these moments to bring a balance into our life in some way I have seen times that have made my heart sad and carry them down through the years Knowing that perhaps things could have been different and not given me so many tears But I am the total of everything that has brought me to this place in time and to this place So I smile for a moment realizing that perhaps it was meant for me because I am a member of the human race Memories are something that each of us bring down through time whether bitter or sweet Thinking back on them I smile and am sad at some because I could not change them to something neat But in the balance I know that whatever life throws at me I have managed to survive and yes to find happiness Finding someone who will touch me for a moment and smile as she gives me a soft and tender caress As the wind dies and stillness envelopes the land I feel the evening of this day as it touches me softly in some way Knowing that at this moment there is such pain in the world at places I enjoy my peace that I have on this day Life is something that each of us clings to as we go down through the years searching and yearning for
