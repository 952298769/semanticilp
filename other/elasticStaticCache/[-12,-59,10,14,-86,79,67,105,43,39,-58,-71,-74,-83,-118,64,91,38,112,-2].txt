[["Transit: The transit time of a celestial body refers to the instant that its center crosses an imaginary line in the sky - the observer's meridian - running from north to south. For observers in low to middle latitudes, transit is approximately midway between rise and set, and represents the time at which the body is highest in the sky on any given day. At high latitudes, neither of these statements may be true - for example, there may be several transits between rise and set. The transit of the Sun is local solar (sundial) noon. The difference between the transit times of the Sun and Moon is closely related to the Moon's phase. The New Moon transits at about the same time as the Sun; the First Quarter Moon transits about 6 hours after the Sun; the Full Moon transits about 12 hours after/before the Sun; and the Last Quarter Moon transits about 6 hours before the Sun.",1.5574032068252563],["The Solstice occurs twice a year approximately 6 months apart, when the Sun hits its highest &amp; lowest points in our sky.",1.185296654701233],["It is 6 p.m. when the moon is at its highest point in the sky looking south.",1.1847891807556152],["When is the Sun at it's highest point in the sky?",1.1242550611495972],["When is the Sun at it's highest point in the sky?",1.1242550611495972],["The award, one of the Empire State's highest honors for service, will be presented during the annual New York State African American Kick-off Celebration, which begins at 6 p.m. in the State Museum Auditorium.",1.073927402496338],["Astronomical noon is defined to be the time of day when the Sun is highest in the sky.",1.070104718208313],["In fact, this week, Tuesday the 20th, Summer began precisely at 9:48 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time when our sun reached its highest point in its annual path across the heavens and was farthest north of the celestial equator for a brief moment, after which , \nof course, it will slowly move southward day by day until it reaches its lowest point, its farthest point south of the celestial equator 6 months from now on the first day of winter.",1.0284276008605957],["On the first full day in New York, take the melatonin at 6 p.m. (which is 3 p.m. on the West Coast);",0.9886666536331177],["We will leave New York at 6 p.m. and arrive back in Boyertown approximately 8:45 p.m. Full payment is required at the time of reservation.",0.980030357837677],["6 Approximately 36,000 according to the New York Times.",0.9721340537071228],["Continental Airlines offer a daily New York (Newark) to Glasgow service which leaves Newark at 10.00 p.m. and arrives into Glasgow at 09.45 the following morning - a flight time of approximately 6 hours 45 minutes.",0.9680163860321045],["Information on the highest taxpayers in the United States in 1925 was reported in the New York Times, September 6, 1925.",0.9158729314804077],["Information on the highest taxpayers in the United States in 1925 was reported in the New York Times, September 6, 1925.",0.9158729314804077],["I took the melatonin when I awoke in New York (6 a.m.) the day before and day of departure and then at 6 p.m. the first day in Thailand (which was 6 a.m. in New York).",0.9039178490638733],["New York, 6 p.m.;",0.902746319770813],["MARS OBSERVER MISSION STATUS August 22, 1993 Communication with the Mars Observer spacecraft was lost at approximately 6 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on Saturday, Aug. 21, as the spacecraft neared to within three days of the planet Mars.",0.8684739470481873]]
