Each of these machines gave humans the earliest labor-saving devices. With pinball machines designed to be fully automated, these machines were rapidly adapted to pinball-related purposes, simplifying set up and maintenance for both players and operators. The lever performs many functions in a pinball machine. The player uses the only tool accessible: a lever called the flipper. Below the playfield, the linkage moving the flipper uses the lever while the mechanics behind the flipper button switch also rely on the lever. Inclined planes create ramps. Wedges drive the ball away from pop bumpers. Wheels with axles run every motor in a machine and help rotating circles of plastic keep your score. Pulleys run features like the cars in Flying Turns or the Ferris wheel in Hurricane. The screw holds it all together. Combined, they create complex machines and hence, electrified, the pinball machine.",1.2896404266357422],["An inclined plane helps a person to move or raise heavy objects.",1.2885212898254395],["An inclined plane helps a person to move or raise heavy objects.",1.2885212898254395],["EXPERIMENT #5 Lesson Title: Simple Machines Topic: Inclined planes in wedges and screws Grade: 5 Rationale: The student will continue their knowledge of inclined planes by observing how this simple machine is created using a screw and a wedge.",1.2821704149246216],["The machine was launched down an inclined plane.",1.2743953466415405],["The machine was launched down an inclined plane.",1.2743953466415405],["The machine was launched down an inclined plane.",1.2743953466415405],["X1011567464-00251-62157</DOCNO> Simple Machine Webpage Simple Machines Unit Description: The &quot;Simple Machine&quot; unit has students actively using levers, inclined planes, and other simple machines.",1.2649494409561157],["It takes less force to move the bag of rice up the inclined plane.",1.2592253684997559]]
