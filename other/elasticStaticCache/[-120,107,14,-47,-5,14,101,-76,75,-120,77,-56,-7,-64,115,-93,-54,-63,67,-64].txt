The simplest illustration of the organisation of the organisms within an ecosystem is the ecological pyramid (food chain). The broad base of primary producers mainly supports overlying layers of herbivores, planktivores and less number of carnivores (predators). Food chains that allow a diversity of species to survive are divided into trophic levels, with plants providing the first trophic level, as they are the primary producers of most food chains. In almost all fresh water ecosystems, animals will be present, and form part of the many grazing food chains in the area. Other organisms leach the energy from dead organic matter forming detritus food chains. Such relationships allow the free flow of organic energy to be passed along from species to species, and provide an environment where food is available for them to survive. Food webs (Figs. 12 to 14) may be described in terms of both energy and nutrient (carbon, nitrogen or phosphorous) flows. The process typically begins with sunlight driven photosynthesis and respiration. Green plants capture energy from sunlight and convert it into living organic plant tissue. Lake photosynthesis includes algae and macrophytes, which together are the primary producers as they create organic material required by other organisms for nutrients and energy. Other fish feed on primary consumers and are called secondary consumers. They constitute the third trophic level. Still larger consumers such as large fish and man are tertiary consumers (fourth trophic level). Hence, energy and nutrients originating from the photosynthetic production of biomass and energy cascade through the food web. Respiration (the oxidation of organic material) releases energy that was originally captured from sunlight through photosynthesis. Decomposers are sinks for plant and animal wastes, but also recycle nutrients for photosynthesis. The amount of dead material in a lake far exceeds the living material. Detritus is the organic fraction of the dead material in a lake and is in the form of small fragments of plants, animals and microorganisms.",1.8759410381317139],["In answering this question you should note the words most truly independent and nourishment. True independence suggests not being subject to control by others or not requiring or relying on something else. Nourishment is food.

Since palm trees are the only green plants listed, that is the correct answer. All organisms depend on a food chain to obtain nourishment.

Chlorophyll, a pigment which gives plants their green color, traps light energy for these organisms to use in making food. Photosynthetic organisms are producers that provide food to nearly all consumers on Earth. For most living organisms, photosynthesis is the first step in the food chain which connects living things. Every land animal depends to some degree on green plants. Photosynthesizing plants take carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and use energy from the sun. Some of the light energy as it interacts with chlorophyll, is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Light energy is then used to join hydrogen and carbon dioxide together to form a new molecule: sugar. The sugar formed is glucose, the food a plant uses for growth and maintenance.",1.7675001621246338],["Scientists remember that all energy comes from the Sun so they generally begin each food chain with a green plant.",1.760772466659546],["a) Grazing food chain- This food chain starts to the green plants goes to green herbivores and on to the cornivores.

This energy is passed on to the Primary Consumer which in this case is the Giant Panda whose main source of food is bamboo (Primary Producer). The Secondary Consumer then eats the Primary. In this ecosystem the Leopard usually eats the Giant Panda bear cubs because the adult pandas are very intimidating out in the wild because of their size.
