The simplest illustration of the organisation of the organisms within an ecosystem is the ecological pyramid (food chain). The broad base of primary producers mainly supports overlying layers of herbivores, planktivores and less number of carnivores (predators). Food chains that allow a diversity of species to survive are divided into trophic levels, with plants providing the first trophic level, as they are the primary producers of most food chains. In almost all fresh water ecosystems, animals will be present, and form part of the many grazing food chains in the area. Other organisms leach the energy from dead organic matter forming detritus food chains. Such relationships allow the free flow of organic energy to be passed along from species to species, and provide an environment where food is available for them to survive. Food webs (Figs. 12 to 14) may be described in terms of both energy and nutrient (carbon, nitrogen or phosphorous) flows. The process typically begins with sunlight driven photosynthesis and respiration. Green plants capture energy from sunlight and convert it into living organic plant tissue. Lake photosynthesis includes algae and macrophytes, which together are the primary producers as they create organic material required by other organisms for nutrients and energy. Other fish feed on primary consumers and are called secondary consumers. They constitute the third trophic level. Still larger consumers such as large fish and man are tertiary consumers (fourth trophic level). Hence, energy and nutrients originating from the photosynthetic production of biomass and energy cascade through the food web. Respiration (the oxidation of organic material) releases energy that was originally captured from sunlight through photosynthesis. Decomposers are sinks for plant and animal wastes, but also recycle nutrients for photosynthesis. The amount of dead material in a lake far exceeds the living material. Detritus is the organic fraction of the dead material in a lake and is in the form of small fragments of plants, animals and microorganisms.",1.490522861480713],["The balance of plants and animals within a food chain is determined by nature.
