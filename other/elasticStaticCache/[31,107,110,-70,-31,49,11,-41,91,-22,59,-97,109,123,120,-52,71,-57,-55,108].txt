Page 33 DETRITAL ROCKS - most important constituents are clay minerals and quartz - texture is clastic, classified according to particle size gravel (conglomerate - breccia) sand (sandstone - arkose- graywake) silt (siltstone) mud (shale or mudstone) 33 Page 34 DETRITAL ROCKS Conglomerate and breccia - consist largely of gravel size particles - usually poorly sorted with particle size ranges from pea size to large boulders with pores sometimes filled with clay - conglomerates have rounded clasts while breccias have more angular clast - 34 Page 35 DETRITAL ROCKS Sandstone - consist mainly of sand size particles - varieties are distinguished based on mineral composition - accounts for ~20% of sed rock abundance - important resource - building and construction 35 Page 36 DETRITAL ROCKS Sandstone - quartz sandstone &gt;90% quartz (well sorted and well rounded) - arkose &gt; 25% of feldspars (poorly sorted with angular particles) - greywacke poorly sorted, dark in color, composed of quartz, feldspar, volcanic fragments, and silt and clay 36 Page 37 DETRITAL ROCKS Siltstone - composed of silt-size material mainly of quartz composition - often exhibit layering but lacks fissility 37 Page 38 DETRITAL ROCKS Mudrocks - composed of clay minerals, other minerals of clay size and small amounts of quartz - because of the small size of these minerals, they can not be distinguished without the aid of \na microscope - the origin of the material (parent) can not be determined 38 Page 39 DETRITAL ROCKS Mudrocks Shale - most abundant sedimentary rock (&gt;75% ) - composed predominantly of silt and clay size minerals - has a finely layered structure along which the rock splits easily called fissility - usually dark in color, contains remains of plants and animal (source for oil and gas) 39 Page 40 DETRITAL ROCKS Mudrocks Mudstone - same composition as shale but lacks fissility - lack of fissility due to disturbance of sediments by organisms (bioturbation) living in mud *** Mudrocks are deposited in a variety of environment indicative of very quiet waters (lakes, marine and flood plains) 40 Page 41 DETRITAL ROCKS Organic/Biochemical - sedimentary rock formed from the accumulation of remains animals may also have a Clastic (broken) Texture e.g. limestone consisting predominantly of broken shell fragments is a bio-clastic limestone 41 Page 42 NON DETRITAL ROCKS
