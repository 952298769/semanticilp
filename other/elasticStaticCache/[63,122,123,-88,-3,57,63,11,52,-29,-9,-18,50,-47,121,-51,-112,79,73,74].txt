to smaller size particles also called mechanical weathering Outline of Topics: Processes Abrasion and Impact Expansion of minerals or rocks Growth of voids Influence of organisms Spheroidal Weathering Influence of climate Abrasion and Impact : Rolling of materials: rounded river cobbles wave action at beach Mass movements: gravity induced landslides avalanche rock falls Wind abrasion: ventifacts sand-blasting Ice abrasion: glacial gouging glacial polish Expansion of Minerals/Rocks : Thermal expansion: product of low thermal conductivity prevents inward transfer of heat external fringes of the rock expand while center does not water within the rock (in pore spaces) is important example: wet rock in a campfire will explode occurs during when a damp rock is effected by a forest fires Unloading: release of confining pressure causes expansion and splitting examples denudation mining - rock bursts river entrenchment - allows valleyward expansion exfoliation: sheets of rock are fractured and detached from outcrop rocks must be massive and not well jointed massive sandstones, igneous rocks curvature of fractures mimic previously existing topography Hydration and swelling: hydration : addition of water into mineral structure causes volume increase differs from hydrolysis chemical weathering of feldspars conversion to clay is associated with increase in volume clay minerals swell tremendously if water is fixed into their structure expansive soils Vertisols : expanding soils forces of expansion can exceed load forces of small buildings swelling salts example: salt shaker clogs on humid days source: sea spray, weathering products expansion of over 300% possible Growth of Voids Initial voids may be present as microfractures and pore spaces Frost action freeze-thaw processes water expands 9% on expansion Mineral growth in voids fluid in pores evaporate pressure produced by growth of minerals common in arid regions Influence of Organisms Burrowing by
