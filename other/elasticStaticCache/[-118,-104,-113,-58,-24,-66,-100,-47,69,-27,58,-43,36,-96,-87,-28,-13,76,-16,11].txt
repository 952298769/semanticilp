water into glucose They have tiny little pores, which allow essential carbon dioxide in and waste gases out Leaves are important for nutrition and excretion 4) Roots The root is the organ which

Captured in Photosynthesis fig 10.1 AN EXPERIMENTAL JOURNEY van Helmont's Plant Growth Experiments Weighed tree and soil in pot Plant grew five years, only water added Plant weight gain greater than weight loss of soil Thus determined that plant substance not derived from soil Incorrectly concluded weight gain due to water The Role of Water Experiments by Priestly to determine nature of air Sprig of mint restored air in jar that a burning candle had depleted Mouse could breathe in jar after plant but not before Ingenhousz reproduced experiments Air restored only in presence of sunlight Occurred only with green plant leaves, not roots Proposed that plants split CO2 into carbon and oxygen Carbon and water combined to form carbohydrates Van Niel examined photosynthesis in bacteria Purple sulfur bacteria convert H2S into sulfur, do not release oxygen Proposed H2A is an electron donor, product A comes from splitting H2A Thus O2 from photosynthesis comes from H2O not CO2 Experiments reproduced using radioactive oxygen Carbohydrate typically produced by plants and algae is glucose The Role of Light Blackman's experiments determined that photosynthesis has two-stages Measured effects of changing light intensities and temperature In low light, higher temperature did not accelerate photosynthesis fig 10.2 In strong light, higher temperature did accelerate it Postulated \"light\" reactions independent of temperature, \"dark\" reactions independent of light At temperatures above 30% enzymes became denatured Present knowledge First stage requires light, reduces electron carriers, makes ATP from ADP In second stage carriers and ATP reduces C in CO2 and makes glucose Carbon fixation incorporates CO2 carbon \ninto glucose in \"dark\" reaction Photosynthesis is a redox process Sun energy drives reduction of carrier molecules Reverse to the electron path in oxidative respiration Electrons in respiration loose energy going from sugar to oxygen Mitochondria use released energy to make ATP Electrons in photosynthesis must gain energy going from water to sugar Energy provided by the sun THE BIOPHYSICS OF LIGHT The Photoelectric Effect Intensity of a generated spark was increased in the presence of light Photoelectric effect discovered by Heinrich Hertz Investigated spark generation and electromagnetic (radio) waves Strength intensified by the brightness and wavelength of light Phenomenon explained by Einstein Light consists of units of energy called photons Light blasted electrons from the wire hoop Create positive ions and facilitate passage of current across gap The Energy in Photons Photons possess differing amounts of energy Energy content inversely proportional to the wavelength fig 10.3 Highest energy wavelengths are short wavelength gamma rays Least energetic wavelengths are long wavelength radio waves Energy in visible light Violet has short wavelength and high energy photons Red has long wavelength and low energy photons Ultraviolet Light Sunlight contains short, energetic ultraviolet light Was a probable source of energy in the primitive earth Current earth shielded by the ozone layer Ultraviolet light causes sunburns CAPTURING LIGHT ENERGY IN CHEMICAL BONDS Electrons occupy discrete energy levels while orbiting in their atoms Specific atoms can absorb only certain photons of light Any given molecule has a characteristic absorption spectrum Pigments Defined as molecules that absorb light Carotenoids fig 10.4 Carbon ring linked to chains with alternating double, single bonds Absorb photons over a broad range, not highly efficient Include beta-carotene, vitamin A and retinal Chlorophylls fig 10.5 Absorb photons by excitation like the photoelectric effect Complex ring structure called a porphyrin ring Metal ion within a network of alternating single and double bonds Absorb photons over a narrow range Chlorophyll a absorbs in violet-blue range Chlorophyll b absorbs in the red range Has an absorption spectrum shifted toward green light Is an accessory pigment within the photocenter of plants Wavelength not absorbed by chlorophylls reflected to eyes as green Chlorophyll Is the Primary Light Gathering Pigment in Photosynthesis Englemann attempted to characterize chlorophyll's absorption spectrum fig 10.6 Arranged alga across a miniature spectrum on a microscope slide Used aerobic bacteria to assess rate of oxygen production Most bacteria accumulated in red and violet-blue regions Users include plants, algae and most photosynthetic bacteria Do not use retinal pigment because of its low efficiency Chlorophyll absorbs in a narrow range, but with great efficiency HOW LIGHT DRIVES CHEMISTRY: THE LIGHT REACTIONS Absorbing Light Energy Light reactions occur on photosynthetic membranes fig 10.7 Photosynthesis occurs on cell membranes in bacteria In plants and algae, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts Evolutionary descendants of

the pigment is excited Excited electron shuttled along electron-carrier molecules Carrier molecules embedded within photosynthetic membrane Proton-pumping channel transports proton across membrane Electron induces event and is passed to an acceptor Passage of protons drives chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP Evolution of the Photocenter Light is captured by network of pigments called the photocenter
