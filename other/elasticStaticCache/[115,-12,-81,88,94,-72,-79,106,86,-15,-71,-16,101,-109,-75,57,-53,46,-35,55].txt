[["however, there is a tremendous benefit due to the increase genetic variation which can be obtained through sexual reproduction Meiosis - sex cell division - gametogenesis meiosis is the special form of cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid germ cells meiosis occurs in the gonads - testes and ovaries meiosis occurs in two steps - these steps are reviewed and diagramed in your text meiosis I metaphase I during metaphase I, the homologous, chromatid pairs align adjacent to each other to form a structure called a tetrad during metaphase I, crossing over occurs resulting in recombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes this process allows for genes on the paternal and maternal chromosomes to randomize this process assures that no offspring will inherit only maternal or paternal genes, but a mixture of both on each chromosome anaphase I each pair of chromatids is pulled from the tetrad to the pole of the dividing cell the centromeres remain intact and the chromatid pairs are pulled as a pair rather than individually as in mitosis meiosis II metaphase II metaphase II is virtually identical to mitosis in terms of chromosome arrangement at the metaphase plate anaphase II individual chromatids are pulled apart with the separation of the centromere this results in two more cells which each have only one representative chromosome for each of the types of chromosomes present in that species note that no DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II Reproductive mechanisms external vs. internal fertilization external fertilization sperm and eggs are released from the organism into the environment fertilization (fusion between the gametes) occurs outside the organism's body this mechanism is used only by animals that live in environments suitable for survival of the released gametes aquatic environments - freshwater or marine (ocean) example organisms: cnidarians, mollusks, echinoderms, amphibians, most fish development of the embryo is almost always external as well (few fish &amp; amphibian exceptions) internal fertilization fertilization occurs within the female of the species requires copulation and usually the male has a copulatory organ this reproductive mechanism allows fertilization to take place within the controlled environment of the animal's reproductive system internally fertilized eggs may develop either externally (most fish, reptiles, birds) or internally (few fish, most sharks, a few reptiles, mammals) external vs. internal development development refers to the development of the embryo - external or internal refer to outside or inside the parent's body external development everything needed for the development of the embryo must be supplied in the egg (from the oocyte) - nothing comes directly from the mother external development requires a suitable environment aqueous or very wet fish eggs, amphibian eggs, marine and freshwater invertebrates lay their eggs directly into the surrounding aqueous environment the eggs have a thin outer layer that serves as a shell, but would not prevent the egg from drying our (desiccating) if it were removed from the water terrestrial environments eggs must be prevented from drying out (desiccation) a thick, sometimes mineralized shell is used to prevent desiccation (reptiles, birds, insects) a shell means that a special set of membranes must be used to allow gas exchange through the shell - this is the amniotic membrane development takes place within the environment of the egg animals that develop externally have rapid developmental periods animals using external development usually produce a large number of eggs to ensure survival of a few animals which lay eggs are termed oviparous internal development placental development placental mammals (non-marsupials) and most sharks/rays have complete development of the offspring in the uterus in placental mammals, the placenta forms a connection between the mother and the developing embryo to provide gas exchange, waste removal, and nutrients development in placental animals usually takes longer than in externally developing animals animals which give birth rather than laying eggs are termed viviparous non-placental development non-placental mammals are the marsupials (kangaroo etc..)",0.9607025980949402],["the relationship of most species of host sea anemones with anemonefishes is facultative Heteractis -- genus containing four species of sea anemones, all of which may host anemonefish host -- one of the partners in a symbiosis, generally the larger one (thus, the sea anemones that are the subject of this book are hosts to both fish and algal symbionts) larva (plural larvae) -- a developmental stage that hatches from an egg and that typically lives in a different environment, looks entirely different, and eats different food from the adult of the species;",0.9292178750038147],["L -
