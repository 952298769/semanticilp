energy - the release of this energy may cause the ground to shake or tremble during an earthquake 3 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES 1) tectonic forces slowly deform the crust along faults or folds, the rocks bend and store elastic energy 2) frictional forces holding the blocks together are often overcome by slippage along the fault 3) slippage allows the rock to elastically return to its original shape producing vibrations earthquakes 4 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR EARTHQUAKES 1) movement of crustal blocks (plate boundaries) - the earth is divided into plates that move and interact at plate boundaries - Plate boundaries are the places where most earthquake occur 2) igneous activities (explosive volcanism) 3) nuclear explosions 5 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES

(seismogram) 9 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE Locating the Earthquake Source Focus - the point at which seismic wave originate (point of initial movement of a fault) Epicenter - location on the surface directly above the earthquake focus 10 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Locating the Distance to the Earthquake Epicenter - based on the difference in arrival time between the P and S waves - difference in arrival time is determined from a plot of time versus distance (travel time graph) - based on earthquake wave velocities difference in arrival time = distance to epicenter 11 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Locating the Earthquake Epicenter - requirement: 3 or more seismic stations 1) determine the distance of the epicenter from travel time graphs 2) to determine location of epicenter, draw circles with a radii = distances to epicenter 3) the intersection of the circles is the location of the source (epicenter) 12 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Earthquake Belts 1) 95%
