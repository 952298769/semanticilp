Prior to that time, they can put on up to 14 kg (30 lb) of body fat to get them through the several months during which they fast. Hibernation in black bears typically lasts 3–8 months, depending on regional climate. [18] [64] During this time, their heart rate drops from 40–50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute and metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of a bear’s (non-hibernating) basal metabolic rate (BMR). Many of the physiological changes a bear exhibits during hibernation are retained slightly post-hibernation. Upon exiting hibernation, bears retain a reduced heart rate and basal metabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a hibernating bear will remain at a reduced level for up to 21 days after hibernation. [65] Reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation. [66] They spend their time in hollowed-out dens in tree cavities, under logs or rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions. Females, however, have been shown to be pickier in their choice of dens, in comparison to males. [67] Although naturally-made dens are occasionally used, most dens are dug out by the bear itself. [54] The hibernating American black bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity, due to ailment or old age. [68] [69] A hibernating black bear loses approximately half the muscular strength to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear’s bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, this implies that the bear’s conservation of bone mass during hibernation is due to a biological mechanism. [70] During hibernation bears retain all excretory waste, and a special hormone, leptin is released into the black bear's systems, to suppress appetite.The retention of waste during hibernation (specifically in minerals such as calcium) may play a role in the bear’s resistance to atrophy. [68] The body temperature of the American black bear does not drop significantly, like other mammalian hibernators (staying around 35 degrees Celsius) and they remain somewhat alert and active. If the winter is mild enough, they may wake up and forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts. [71] During winter, black bears consume 25–40% of their body weight. [72] The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue. In the southernmost areas (i.e. Florida, Mexico, the Southeastern United States ) of the black bear's distribution, only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation. [5] The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear's success in captivity. [73] After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity. In mountainous areas, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses. Black bears use dense cover for hiding and thermal protection, as well as for bedding.",0.7509737014770508],["Generally, American black bears are largely crepuscular in foraging active, though may actively feed at any time. [56] Up to 85% of the black bear's diet consists of vegetation, [35] though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots , bulbs , corms and tubers than the latter species. [53] When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates . As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses , wetland plants and forbs . [72] Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. [74] During summer, the diet is comprised largely by fruits , especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia , feeding becomes pretty much the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts become the most important part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts , oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. [5] [32] During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels . [72] Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries . [5] Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime.
