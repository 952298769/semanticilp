External respiration: uptake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide THE COMPOSITION OF AIR Composition and Properties of Air All oxygen in the air is a result of photosynthesis Dry air = 78.09% N2 + 20.95% O2 + 0.93% (argon + inert gases) + 0.03 CO2 Amount of air present decreases at high altitudes fig 46.1 At sea level, air pressure measures 760 mm of mercury fig 46.2 Equals the barometric pressure of air Equivalent to one atmosphere of pressure Each gas within the air exerts a partial pressure = 760 x % gas Nitrogen + inert gases = 760 x 79.02% = 600.6 mm Hg Oxygen = 760 x 20.95% = 159.2 mm Hg Carbon dioxide = 760 x 0.03% = 0.2 mm Hg Less air, therefore less oxygen present at high altitudes Barometric pressure above 6000 meters = 380 mm Hg Partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)= 380 x 20.95% = 80 mm Hg Only half the oxygen is available compared to sea level The Diffusion of Gases Across Cell Membranes Cell membranes of terrestrial organisms \nfreely permeable to oxygen Cell membranes cannot exist without a surrounding layer of water Oxygen concentration in cytoplasm lower than liquid surrounding cells Net diffusion of oxygen from environment into cells Net diffusion of carbon dioxide in opposite direction Gases redistributed by circulatory system Fick's Law of Diffusion Diffusion of oxygen into the epithelial aqueous layer is passive Driven by the difference in oxygen concentration between the interior of the organism and the external environment Mathematical relationship called Fick`s Law of Diffusion R = D x A x &Delta;p / d R = rate of diffusion D = diffusion constant A = area over which diffusion takes place &Delta;p = difference in partial pressures on each side d = distance across which diffusion takes place Evolutionary changes optimize R by favoring certain parameters fig 46.3 Increase surface area Decrease distance d Increase concentration difference &Delta;p THE EVOLUTION OF EXTERNAL RESPIRATION fig 46.5 Simple Diffusion Oxygen diffuses too slowly to be efficient over more than 0.5 mm Severely limits size of organisms Protists are small enough to utilize simple diffusion fig 46.3 As size increases, surface area-to volume ratio decreases Surface area proportional to radius squared (r2) Volume proportional to radius cubed (r 3) Surface area-to-volume ratio proportional to r2/r3 or 1/r As the radius increases the ratio decreases Metabolism may be slowed down to compensate Increase in size must be accompanied by facilitation of diffusion of oxygen into organism Creating a Water Current Most primitive phyla possess no special respiratory organs Can obtain oxygen via diffusion by increasing &Delta;p in Fick`s equation Increase difference in O2 concentration by creating a water current Constantly replace water over diffusion surface &Delta;p does not decrease as diffusion proceeds Keep exterior O2 concentration high Results in higher realized value of R, rate of diffusion Increasing the Diffusion Surface Area More advanced invertebrates and vertebrates possess respiratory organs Increase surface area over which diffusion occurs Provides contact between external environment and internal circulating fluids

enables aquatic organisms to extract more oxygen Enclosing the Gills Disadvantage of external gills Difficult to constantly circulate water past diffusion surface Neotenic amphibian larvae physically move gill through water fig 46.4 Inefficient, highly branched gills offer resistance against movement Special branchial chambers in other organisms pump water past gills Internal mantle cavity of mollusks opens to outside, contains gills Contraction of muscular walls draws water in and expels it Crustacean cavity lies between body and hard exoskeleton Movement of limbs draws water through branchial chamber THE FISH GILL AS AN AQUATIC RESPIRATORY MACHINE Most Successful Branchial Chamber Evolved in Bony Fishes Water passes through mouth into two opercular cavities Gills are located between mouth and entrance to cavity Water then passes out of body after passing over gills and through cavity One-way flow of water over gills Maintains high concentration of oxygen outside gills

meets most oxygenated water at front of gill Diffusion occurs along entire length of gill If water and blood flowed in the same direction Oxygen-free blood would meet highly oxygenated water Diffusion would initially be high fig 46.7b Oxygenated blood would meet less oxygenated water at back of gill Diffusion would cease, only front part of gill would be functional Fish gills are up to 85% efficient FROM AQUATIC TO ATMOSPHERIC BREATHING More Oxygen Present in Air Than in Water Water = 5-10 ml O2 per 1 liter water Air = 210 ml of O2 per 1 liter air Many aquatic animals use air as their oxygen source Gills Not Adaptable for Terrestrial Use Air is less buoyant than water Lamellae lack structural support, collapse without water buoyancy Collapse reduces diffusion surface area Internal air passages remain open due to structural support Water diffuses into air through evaporation Terrestrial organisms constantly lose water to atmosphere Gills provide an enormous surface area for water loss Evolved two main kinds of terrestrial respiratory organs Both systems sacrifice efficiency to reduce water loss Tracheae of insects fig 46.3d Extensive series of air-filled passages within body Oxygen diffuses directly from trachea to cells, no circulatory intervention Openings close when CO2 levels are below certain point to limit water loss Lungs of terrestrial vertebrates Air enters

through nostrils Lined with hairs to filter out dust Extensive array of cilia further cleans and moistens air fig 46.11 Air passes through glottis Slit in larynx (voice box) Enters trachea, branches into two bronchi one for each lung fig 46.12 Bronchi further branch into smaller tubes, narrowest called bronchioles Trachea and bronchi reinforced with cartilaginous rings Bronchioles have only smooth muscle in walls Smooth muscle lining adjusts size of passageway Contraction stimulated by parasympathetic division of the nervous system Decrease in diameter by half increases resistance sixteen fold Sympathetic division relaxes smooth muscle, causes bronchodilation, decreases resistance Bronchodilation also caused by epinephrine Drug used to treat symptoms of asthma triggered by release of histamine The Structure of the Lung Terminal bronchioles deliver air to respiratory bronchioles Contain alveoli where gas exchange occurs Alveoli are outpouchings surrounded by capillaries Lines by epithelium only one cell layer thick Outside of lungs covered by visceral pleural membrane Inner wall of thoracic cavity lined by parietal pleural membrane Space between membranes called the pleural cavity Normally small and filled with fluid Fluid links membranes together like water film holds two sheets of cellophane together Lungs held tight to thoracic cavity Each lung has own pleural cavity, if one punctured other lung functional Air Flow in the Lung Human lung functions as one-cycle pump During inhalation or inspiration Rib external intercostal muscles contract raising the ribs fig 46.13 Diaphragm contracts, lowers and flattens Increases volume of thorax Due to coupling of pleural membranes, volume of lungs also increases Pressure of air in lungs decreases, air drawn into lungs fig 46.14 During exhalation or expiration Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax Structures of thorax return to previous condition Volume of thorax and lungs decreases Increases pressure of air in lungs, air forced out Extra air can be forced out of lungs Contraction of internal intercostal muscles lowers ribs Diaphragm pushed further up into thoracic cavity fig 46.13b Air
