single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up main sequence Common type of star in our Galaxy is faint, cool, M-type star, Known as red dwarf Presumably also true for other galaxies, but too faint to prove Mass-Luminosity Relation for

supergiants - if late-type stars in classes G, K, and M Blue and red supergiants can be hundreds of thousands of times more luminous than Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they
