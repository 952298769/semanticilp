radiation Only using the heat of the sun wastes a great deal of energy The sun is a black body radiation source When objects are warm, they give off that heat by radiation by emitting light of different energies The temperature of the object determines the energy of the radiation that it gives off For regular temperatures (like body temperature), most of the energy is in the infrared part

level by absorbing energy Once in the higher energy level, the electron may spontaneously return to the lower energy state, emitting a photon of light in the process They may also be stimulated to decay into the lower energy state by interacting with a photon of light with the same energy that will be emitted by the electron If this occurs, the original photon and the one generated by the
