Invasion by Microbes fig 50.1 Vertebrates Have Evolved a Variety of Defenses Against Invaders STRATEGIES OF IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE Bacterial Cells Produce Restriction Endonucleases that Degrade Viral DNA Invertebrate Organisms Employ Negative Test Against Invaders All body cells possess cell surface proteins that identify \"self\" Cells lacking self protein are destroyed Employ negative test to recognize foreign cells and invaders Does not protect against copycat invaders Vertebrates Employ a Multilevel Defense First line of defense is nonspecific Like walls and moats of medieval cities Skin and mucous membranes block entry of invaders Second line of defense uses cells that function like roaming patrols Nonspecific defenses of chemicals and cells Act rapidly with infection Employ negative test that cannot be foiled by copycat foreign cells All cells possess major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins Different in each individual Genes encoding MHC proteins are highly polymorphic Third line of defense is a positive test Identifies molecules characteristic of foreign microbes, cancer cells Scan surface of every cell encountered, like sentries Cells possess surface receptor molecules that recognize \"non-self\" molecules Two kinds of cellular sentries comprise vertebrate immune system Cells that aggressively attack foreign identified cells Cells that mark foreign cells for elimination by roaming patrols THE FIRST BATTLE IN VERTEBRATE DEFENSE IS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BODY Skin Largest organ in human body Physically protects against microbe entry Provides chemical defenses on surface Oil and sweat glands make skin's surface acidic Inhibits growth of microorganisms Sweat contains lysozyme that digests bacterial cell walls Prevents body water loss by evaporation Composed of three layers: epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissue fig 50.2 Epidermis is the \"bark\" of the vertebrate body Stratum corneum is outermost layer Constantly subjected to damage Cells shed continuously Replenished by stratum basale layer deep in epidermis Psoriasis: chronic skin disorder, cells reach epidermis faster than usual Lower skin layers provide support and insulation Dermis is thicker than epidermis Supports epidermis Provides matrix for nerve endings, muscles, blood vessels Wrinkling accompanying aging occurs here Subcutaneous tissue lies below dermis Composed of adipose cells Acts as shock absorber Insulates body, conserves body heat Thickness varies throughout body Other External Surfaces Alternate routes of entry for invaders Digestive tract Saliva contains lysozymes Stomach produces digestive acids Intestine produces protein-digesting enzymes Respiratory tract Inner cells produce entrapping mucus, swept outward by cilia Ciliated epithelial cells trap microbes NONSPECIFIC DEFENSES Actions that Provide Response Without Determining Identity of Invader Cells that directly ingest invading microbes Antimicrobial proteins kill pathogens Inflammatory response speeds defending cells to point of infection Temperature response slows growth of invading bacteria Cells that Kill Invading Microbes Three basic kinds Macrophages are one type of phagocyte fig 50.3 Directly ingest individual bacteria Bacterium pulled inside \nvia phagocytosis Vacuole with bacterium attacked by cell`s lysosome Most activity occurs in blood, lymph and extracellular fluid Monocytes respond to infection and transform into macrophages Neutrophils are also phagocytic White blood cells that directly ingest bacteria Macrophages kill only one cell at a time Neutrophils release bleach-like chemicals that kill many invaders at once Also kill selves in process Natural killer cells do not attack microbes directly Attack cells infected by microbes and especially viruses Not phagocytic, create a pore in target cell membrane fig 50.4 Target cell absorbs water, swells and bursts fig 50.5 Cells distinguish \"self\" from \"not self\" Due to MHC proteins In autoimmune diseases defensive cells attack body's own tissues Proteins that Kill Invading Microbes Complement system Named because it complements cellular defenses Complex composed of about twenty circulating proteins Proteins form membrane attack complex with bacteria or fungus Forms pore in membrane, cell swells and bursts fig 50.6 Aggregation also triggered by antibodies binding to invaders Augment other body defenses Amplify immune response by stimulating histamine release Attract phagocytes to area of infection Coat invading microbes to help macrophages stick more readily Interferons Released by virus-infected cells Diffuse into other cells, inhibit virus infection Sound alert for immune system The Inflammatory Response Infected or injured cells release chemicals Include histamine and prostaglandin Promote dilation of blood vessels, increase local blood flow and temperature Increase permeability of capillaries Produces edema and tissue swelling Allow phagocytes to migrate from blood to extracellular fluid Neutrophils arrive first, make killing chemicals, produce pus Macrophages follow engulfing remains of dead cells Autoimmune diseases like arthritis have inflammation without infection The Temperature Response Pyrogens are chemicals released by macrophages Include interleukin-1 Carried by blood to brain Induces fever: increased body temperature Stimulates phagocytosis, inhibits microbial growth Excessive fever may inactivate critical body enzymes SPECIFIC IMMUNE DEFENSES Third Line of Defense Is More Difficult to Evade Remembers Previous Encounters with Potential Invaders Catching many diseases results in permanent immunity to each disease Immune system provides mechanism for immunity and resisting infection DISCOVERY OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE Jenner and Smallpox fig 50.7 Milkmaids rarely developed smallpox infections Cowpox conferred resistance to smallpox First use of vaccination: injecting harmless microbe to confer resistance to harmful one Pasteur and Fowl Cholera Isolated culture of organisms that would elicit disease in other fowl Weakened culture caused minor symptoms and conferred immunity Immune response reacted to foreign molecules on surface of bacteria fig 50.8 Antigens: non-self foreign molecules Antibodies: proteins produced that recognize specific antigen Immune response: production of antibodies against specific antigen Primary immune response: antibody production by initial antigen Secondary immune response: amplified production of antibodies with second exposure to same antigen THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM tbl 50.1 Immune System Not Localized Within a Single Body Organ Composed of individual white blood cells Found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, thymus and bone marrow fig 50.9 Produced in bone marrow, circulate in blood and lymph Nucleated white blood cells formed from hemopoietic stem cells Several kinds Phagocyte cells: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes Lymphocytes: T cells and B cells T Cells fig 50.10a Arise from bone marrow stem cells and travel to thymus Develop ability to identify invaders via surface antigens Different T cells recognize different antigens Four kinds of T cells Inducer T cells: oversee development of T cells in thymus Helper T cells: initiate immune response Cytotoxic T cells: lyse cells infected with viruses Suppressor T cells: terminate immune response B Cells Arise from and mature in bone marrow, do not travel to thymus Circulate in blood and lymph Individual cells specialized to recognize specific antigens Antigen initiates rapid

PROTEINS OF IMMUNE CELLS Cell Surface Proteins Play Role in Immune Response fig 50.11, tbl 50.2 MHC \"Self\" Proteins Recognized by Immune Receptors MHC-1 present on every nucleated cell in body MHC-II found only on macrophages, B cells and T4 cells Human MHC proteins specified by highly variable HLA (human leukocyte-associated antigen)genes Cell Identity Markers Glycoproteins that identify particular types of cells Human T cells identified by CD3 marker Inducer and helper T cells (T4) exhibit CD4 protein Cytotoxic and suppressor cells (T8) exhibit CD8 protein T and B Lymphocytes Possess Immune Receptor Proteins Serve to identify foreign molecules, antigens Encoded by genes assembled by somatic rearrangement Two classes: B receptors and T receptors T receptors remain on surface of T cells B receptors secreted by B cells, also called antibodies ARCHITECTURE OF THE IMMUNE DEFENSE fig 50.12 Immediate Response fig 50.12 Infected cell secretes interferons Stimulate natural killer cells and macrophages Natural killer cells pierce holes in infected cells Macrophages engulf cells Enzymatically degrade protein coat of engulfed virus Display coat fragments on cell surface Prepare viral surface antigens for recognition by T cells Called \"antigen-presenting cells\" Response peak: 1-2 days (natural killer cells), 1 week (macrophages) fig 50.12a Macrophages also secrete regulatory cytokine molecules -interferon activates other monocytes to mature into macrophages Interleukin-1 activates helper T cells, prepares them to proliferate Macrophages initiate immune response Immune Response Helper T cells activate T cell and B cell immune defenses T cells recognize and destroy infected body cells B cells provide second defense, antibodies provide long-term protection The

to viral coat proteins on cell surface and to MHC-I antigen Disrupts plasma membrane of infected cell, lyses cell Called cell-mediated because of interaction between cytotoxic T cells and infected cells Cytotoxic response peaks one week after infection fig 50.12b Response causes rejection in tissue transplants Suppression Suppressor T cells block response of cytotoxic T cells to antigen Slow proliferation prevents early blocking of cytotoxic attack Significant numbers present after one to two weeks Memory Persistence of a population of helper and cytotoxic T cells Memory T cells provide accelerated response to later infection The humoral immune response fig 50.16 Key players in this response are B cells Response named humoral because antibodies circulate in blood plasma Proliferation B receptors bind to free viral antigens Helper T cells detect bound B cells, bind to antigen, MHC-II fig 50.17 T cells release lymphokines that induce B cell proliferation Differentiation and secretion Proliferated B cells form plasma cells Plasma cells produce and secrete B receptor, called antibodies or immunoglobulins (Igs) First secrete class M (IgM) antibodies, peaks after one week

dilate arterioles and release histamine Opsonization - binds to microbes and combines w/ phagocytes Cytolysis proteins form membrane attack complex poke holes in bacteria, allow insides to leak out Natural killer cells Lymphocytes w/ ability to kill wide variety of microbes and some tumor cells Mechanisms unknown Phagocytosis - ingestion of microbes or foreign material by phagocytes 2 kinds of phagocytosis by granulocytes and macrophages Neutrophils most active of granulocytes, eosinophils also some activity Monocytes enlarge, develop into phagocytic macrophages, make up mononuclear phagocytic (reticuloendothelial) system wandering fixed Mechanism of phagocytosis chemotaxis - chemical attraction of phagocytes to a location adherence phagocyte attachment to microorganism surface or foreign material made simpler by opsonization ingestion - cell membrane extends pseudopods engulfs microorganism Killing lysosome combines w/ phagocytic vesicle forms a large phagolysosome has lysozymes (digestive enzymes), oxidants and bactericidal substances 10-30 minutes for destruction residual bodies material that cannot be broken down exocytosis for disposal some microbes (staphylococci) ingested but not killed may kill phagocytes may \nremain dormant in phagocytes for months or years Inflammation Response when cells damaged by microbes, physical agents, chemical agents, injury some form of stress Characterized by 5 symptoms: redness, pain, heat, swelling, loss of function First step in inflammation is vasodilation and blood vessel permeability after initial damage blood vessels vasodilate and permeability vasodilatory substances histamine from mast cells, basophils, platelets, vasodilate capillary permeability kinins from blood precursors vasodilate, permeability, chemotactic agents prostaglandins release by damaged cells intensify effects of histamine and kinins, also stimulate phagocyte migration through cap walls leukotrienes from basophils and mast cells permeability, adherence, chemotaxis complement system stim histamine, release/activate neutrophils by chemotaxis promote phagocytosis and can destroy bacteria Effects of inflammation blood flow through area, local temp and local metabolism permeability for defense materials to leave blood to tissue Phagocyte migration neutrophils arrive squeeze between cap endothelium (diapedesis) chemotaxis bone marrow production blood WBC's (leukocytosis) monocytes follow neutrophils to affected area (hours later) more phagocytic than neutrophils engulf microbes, damaged tissue, and tired neutrophils pus -

ability of antigen to react specifically w/ antibodies or cells Chemical nature of antigens large, complex molecules mostly proteins, sometimes nucleo-, lipo-, glyco- T cells only respond to proteins smaller substances may be partial antigens only promote reactivity, not immunogenicity poison ivy toxin only reactive after combining w/ protein in body antigen may be entire microbe, or bacterial structures: flagella, capsule, cell wall, also pollen, egg white, incompatible blood cells Antigenic determinants - specific portions of antigen molecules that trigger immune response Diversity of antigen receptors - up to 1 billion different antigenic determinants recognized by body diversity genetic recombination, shuffle, reorganize different genes for variability gene segments for B cells antigen receptors unusually susceptible to somatic mutations allowing for more variety Major histocompatibility complex antigens unique to each individuals cells, help to aid in identifying foreign bodies 2 classes of MHC antigens class I MHC - membrane molecules of all body cells except RBC's class II MHC - only on surface of antigen presenting cells, cells of thymus, and activated T cells Pathways of antigen processing Start immune response B, T cells must recognize presence foreign antigen B cells can recognize and bind to antigens in extracellular fluid T cells only recognize fragments of antigens proteins that have been processed and presented in association w/ MHC self-antigens Under normal conditions during breakdown and production of proteins, small peptide fragments inserted into MHC proteins to stabilize them, when these are proteins from body cells, no response Steps in processing exogenous antigen - most body cells can process and present endogenous antigens, antigens produced in a cell from the body (viral proteins from virus infected cells) Antigen-presenting cells (APC's) process exogenous antigens (viral proteins from foreign cells in body) and present them w/ MHC class II molecules to T cells APC's include macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells Steps include phagocytosis or endocytosis of antigen, partial digestion fusion of vesicles binding of peptide fragments to MHC-II molecules and exocytosis to attach these proteins to membrane Lymphocyte maturation - formation of T cells and B cells Both T and B cells derive from stem cells in bone marrow T cells complete their maturation and develop immunocompetence (ability to carry out immune response) in thymus Before T cells leave thymus or B cells leave bone marrow: acquire surface proteins, antigen receptors, molecules capable of recognizing specific antigens T cells exit as CD4+ or CD8+ cells w/ different functions Types of immune responses - 2 types General CD4+ T cells become helper T cells aid both types of immune responses pathogens often activate both types of responses Cell-mediated (cellular) immune (CMI) responses CD8+ T cells proliferate into killer T cells, directly attack infecting antigen particularly effective against: intracellular pathogens (fungi, parasites, and viruses) some cancer cells foreign tissue transplants Antibody-mediated (humoral) immune (AMI) responses B cells transform into plasma cells synthesize, secrete specific proteins (antibodies Abs) or immunoglobulins antibodies bind to and inactivate antigens particularly effective against: antigens dissolved in body fluids EC pathogens, bacteria, that grow in ECF but don't enter cells Antibodies (Abs) Protein that can combine specifically w/ antigenic determinant of antigen that triggered its production, are globulins Have 4 protein chains - 2 identical heavy, 2 identical light held together w/ disulfide bonds in &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;T&quot; structure Grouped into 5 different classes (most abundant to least) IgG most abundant protect against bacteria and viruses enhance phagocytosis, neutralizing toxins and triggering complement system IgA -

small protein hormones needed for normal cell activity secreted by lymphocytes (lymphokines) and APC's Cell-mediated immunity Antigen recognition by T cells - are already antigens to some substances T cell receptors (TCR's) recognize and bind to foreign antigen presented together w/ MHC molecules need co-stimulator up to 20 co-stimulators known, cytokines, maybe some other surface protein identification to fully start immune response may prevent false activation Proliferation and differentiation of T cells - after identification of antigen T cell enlarges and proliferates making clones that can also recognize the antigen Helper T (T H ) cells from CD4 T cells within hours after co-stimulation helper begin secreting cytokines, particularly interleukin-2 co-stimulates other helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells Cytotoxic T (T C ) cells from CD8 T cells recognize antigen fragments associated w/ \nMHC-I molecules, some tumor cells and tissue transplant cells become cytolytic need IL-2 or other cytokines from helper T cells Suppressor T (T S ) cells existence controversial may downregulate immune system by production of other cytokines Memory T (T M ) cells recognize the original invading antigen second response rapid due to large numbers of T M cells present Activity of cytotoxic T cell - Elimination of invaders Cytotoxic T cells leave lymph, migrate to site of infection Recognize and attach to target cell w/ same antigen that stimulated them Eliminate invaders by secreting perforin (cytolysis) or lymphotoxin (LT) which causes DNA fragmentation Secrete gamma interferon, attract neutrophils, macrophages, activity Detach and seek out another invader w/ proper antigen Activation, proliferation and differentiation of B cells Immunological memory presence of long lived antibodies, very long lived lymphocytes that arise during proliferation and differentiation of antigen-stimulated B and T cells antibody mediated responses immunization possible because memory B cells and memory T cells remain after 1 response with secondary exposure system responds more quickly and forcefully -
