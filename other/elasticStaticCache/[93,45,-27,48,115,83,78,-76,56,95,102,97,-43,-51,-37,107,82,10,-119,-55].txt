similarities to vertebrate brain: 1) generally larger than any other part of invertebrate CNS 2) brain is morphologically and functionally specialized Connectives Join CNS ganglia Most axons small, less than 1 micron diameter, some large as 50 microns, invertebrate axons unmyelinated Conduction speed depends on axon diameter Large axons for time critical behaviors such as escape Functional organization \nof invertebrate CNS Invertebrate CNS exhibits highly specific organization, often possible to identify the same specific neuron in different individuals of same species Brain in invertebrate plays same functional role as brain of vertebrate, to process sensory information, to make decision and to organize motor output Some invertebrate brains highly sophisticated, with specialized regions for functions such as memory Vertebrate spinal cord Lies in dorsally situated vertebral column from base of brain to pelvis White matter Bundles of myelinated axons, that mostly connect parts of the cord with one another or with the brain each tract or column carries specific sensory or motor information dorsally located columns generally carry sensory information up to brain ventrally located columns generally carry motor commands down from brain Gray matter Cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses ventral horns contain motor neuron cell bodies, innervate somatic muscles via ventral root nerves dorsal horn contains neurons that receive sensory input via peripheral nerves lateral regions of gray matter contain cell bodies of efferent autonomic neurons Spinal nerves most sensory information enters cord via dorsal roots each dorsal root contains swelling, dorsal root ganglion, containing cell bodies of sensory neurons motor information leaves the cord via ventral roots dorsal and ventral roots fuse close to spinal cord to form spinal nerves, run out between vertebrae of backbone spinal nerves are identified and numbered according to the part of the cord they serve and position in that part The vertebrate brain Located in head and supervises much or all of animal's behavior In vertebrates and invertebrates brain size roughly scaled with body size Brain tends to be larger and more complex in relation to body size in mammals and birds than in fish and amphibians In mammals, and in humans in particular, size of forebrain, including cerebral cortex increased with respect to rest of brain Growth during development produces folds in cortical surface Gyrus outfolding of cortical surface Sulcus infolding of cortical surface Smaller gyri and sulci in different places in different individuals Larger ones invariant landmarks Gray matter at outer surface of brain- cortex Fiber tracts, white matter underneath Nuclei distinct collections of cell bodies Brain Development Neural tube Brain and spinal cord originate from neural tube that runs length of embryo Anterior end of neural tube develops three distinct lobes- forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) Forebrain becomes telencephalon and diencephalon Hindbrain becomes cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata The brain of the leopard frog Development of human brain During second month of development, tube begins to buckle or flex in several places 35-50 days medulla and metencephalon grow rapidly forcing junction between them into ventral bend about 50 days anterior telencephalon begins period of enormous growth, eventually growing over and enclosing much of rest of brain, becomes cerebral hemispheres Central core and external coverings of brain Hollow center of neural tube develops into central canal of spinal cord and ventricles of brain Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A clear colorless fluid, containing ions but devoid of protein and blood cells fills ventricles and circulates over surface of brain, cushions brain against shock of impact, provides suitable chemical environment for neural tissue Meninges Layers of tissue that surround, support, and protect brain Produce and aid in the circulation of CSF Blood-brain barrier Cells that line blood vessels in brain form especially tight seals with one another, making it difficult or impossible for substances in blood to enter brain tissue, additional protection in lining of ventricles Critical for keeping brain tissue isolated from metabolites and toxins in blood The lower brain Brainstem Medulla, pons, and midbrain form a linear arrangement, and therefore referred to as brainstem Cerebellum is also part of the hindbrain, but not considered part of brainstem, because not in line with other components Medulla and pons Nuclei Contain nuclei that help to control basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and initiating reflexive actions- coughing, gagging, vomiting Medullary and pontine nuclei associated with cranial nerves, contain cell bodies of motor neurons whose axons leave brain via some of the cranial nerves Fiber tracts some nerve tracts connect brain stem nuclei with one another, some connect nuclei in brain stem to the spinal cord or brain, some go straight through brainstem, connecting spinal to nuclei in midbrain and forebrain pyramidal tracts ventrally located, carry information from motor centers of forebrain to motor centers of spinal cord, corticospinal tracts convey information from brain to spinal cord, spinocortical tracts convey information from spinal cord to brain Reticular formation or reticular activating system Loose network forming a number of biochemically and morphologically distinct groups within the brainstem, that communicate extensively with one another, as well as with other parts of the brain Functions: modulate sensation of pain modulate certain postural reflexes and muscle tone help control breathing and heartbeat to regulate the level of brain arousal and, in humans, consciousness Raphe nuclei Lie along midline of medulla, pons, and midbrain, are especially important in maintaining wakefulness, damage can result in permanent coma All sensory input that enters the medulla also sent to neurons of reticular formation, may monitor sensory input for importance, and alert higher brain centers when critical input is detected Input from cortex may aid in decisions The Cranial nerves I Olfactory nerve - sensory, supplies olfactory input to olfactory bulb II Optic nerve - sensory, supplies visual input to lateral geniculate, among other places III Oculomotor nerve - motor, controls most eye muscles, output from mesencephalon IV Troclear nerve - motor, controls superior oblique muscle of eye, output from mesencephalon V Trigeminal nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the face, controls muscles that move the jaw, connections with mesencephalon, pons and medulla VI Abducens nerve - motor, controls external rectus eye muscles, output from pons VII Facial nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the toungue and palate, controls the muscles of the face, connections with pons and medulla VIII Vestibulocochlear - sensory, carries auditory and balance \ninput, input to pons and medulla IX Glossopharyngeal nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the tongue and throat, controls throat muscles, connections with pons and medulla X Vagus nerve - Mixed (autonomic) carries sensory input from the heart, lungs, and viscera, controls movements of the heart, lungs, and viscera, connections with pons and medulla XI Accessory nerve - motor, controls neck muscles, output from medulla XII Hypoglossal - motor, controls tongue and neck muscles, output from medulla The Cerebellum Known functions: 1) coordinating motor action 2) learning and memory of motor tasks 3) possibly certain types of cognitive tasks How these functions carried out not known Cerebellar peduncles bundles of thousands of axons that connect cerebellum to brainstem and send information to and from it Cerebellar cortex three layers contains only a few distinct cell types neurons and inputs arranged in an extraordinarily regular array receives input from just two types of neurons 1) climbing fibers from inferior olivary nucleus of medulla 2) mossy fibers from other brain nuclei Purkinje cells output from cerebellar cortex to cerebellar nuclei Cerebellar nuclei, in turn, send output to other areas of brain Knowledge of cerebellar function comes from brain lesion studies in animals and accidents in humans reduced muscle tone and balance following damage to some parts of cerebellum, these parts involved in muscle tone and balance during voluntary and reflexive movements shaking and slowness or difficulty in executing movements associated with damage to other portions of cerebellum learning and memory related to motor tasks cerebellum may be involved in cognitive tasks that require mental manipulation of spatial relationships The midbrain Optic tectum/superior colliculus- optic tectum prominent in non-mammals, major visual center in frogs, fish detecting and selecting targets for orienting movements of body, eyes Torus semicircularis/inferior colliculus- torus located in tegmentum in non-mammals, inferior colliculus located on dorsal midbrain posterior to superior colliculus, auditory processing structure Tegmentum portion of midbrain that lies under cerebral aqueduct contains red nucleus and substantia nigra important in orientation reflexes, maintaining posture, and voluntary movements, substantia nigra damaged in Parkinson's disease, a motor disorder The diencephalon The \"lower\" part of the forebrain, largely covered by telencephalic structures in many vertebrates, consists mainly of thalamus and hypothalamus Thalamus i mportant relay station for sensory information en route to the appropriate cortical center, specific regions process input from specific sense organs Lateral geniculate nuclei- receive input from the optic nerves of the eyes Medial geniculate nuclei- receive auditory information Other thalamic nuclei receive input from reticular formation, project to cerebral cortex, some participate in motor control Hypothalamus Regulate internal state of body to maintain conditions necessary for life Homeostasis-maintaining a relatively constant internal state, regulation of body temperature, blood pressure, salt and water levels Hypothalamus involved in homeostasis in three ways: 1) initiate or surpress behaviors such as eating or drinking that affect internal body conditions 2) regulates pituitary gland, exerts control over endocrine system, which in turn adjusts many internal conditions such as salt and water balance in blood 3) regulates many homeostatic conditions by control of autonomic system, which influences factors such as blood pressure and body temperature hypothalamus also part of system necessary for expression of emotions, emotional reactions in mammals involve extensive changes in factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and
