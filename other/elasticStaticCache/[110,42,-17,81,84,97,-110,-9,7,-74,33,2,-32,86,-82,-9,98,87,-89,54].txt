caribiner and try to kill the shark for meat two boys and a scared little man the shark is yellowish gray and guillermina is there the majestic matriarch we stand side by side on a little hill of sand our faces to the wind the two women for whom the men are showing off my lover wants to steal center stage but cannot contrive it he drags out a ragged net a long rope and the harpoon that i found and presents them to the poor little man nelson stands back making wise remarks worthy of his age while the little man strips down to his shorts ties the rope around his waist the boys hold the rope to haul him back in, i suppose if the shark strikes back he stands in the gray waves aiming the long caribiner crack , he hits the shark it plunges, no blood disappears for a while, surfaces and swims back and forth crack, he hits the shark it plunges, no blood disappears for a while, surfaces and swims back and forth crack, he hits the shark it plunges, no blood disappears for a while, surfaces and swims back and forth nelson is grumbling about the bullets lost i tell guillermina she was the most beautiful woman in the world the woman of gold gold skin, gold hair, gold earrings golden mulatta with long white hair dyed red gold old fashioned solid gold earrings tall proud african, a big woman, over two hundred pounds certainly two of me her long machete always hangs from her hand as she strolls through her coconut plantation to cut down coconuts to open coconuts in four whacks to fish out blue crabs from the tide pools to cut weeds as she strolls to harvest yuccas, yams and black-eyed peas to carry one coconut pierced and hanging from the tip of her machete the shark swims out in the remolina in the whirlpool, just out of reach we women watch as the men heroic and showing off play with danger at the sea's edge the sea eats the coconut rows one by one guillermina tells me how the sea ate her house ate the church ate the school ate the whole town ate four rows of coconut trees how this end of the island stretched way out to the low water mark a quarter mile out to sea nelson says the sea will give back the sand one day he carries his machete cradled in his arms a razor sharp baby his brahman cows get loose one full moon night go down the beach i see them go they get trapped far from home by the high tide a tide so high it takes down more coconut trees a tide so high it washes driftwood up the path to my house i wonder how many full moons it would take for the high tide to reach my house for the sea to eat my house guillermina tells me when she was a young woman standing at the dock they were raising a cow out of a boat with ropes and a pulley and a shark jumped up and in one bite ate the whole hind quarter of the cow guillermina's coconut trees have beetles in them that eat out the hearts of the palms and the palm leaves die, one by one they hang like broken arms swinging and soughing in the sea wind looking like death and my lovers hair
