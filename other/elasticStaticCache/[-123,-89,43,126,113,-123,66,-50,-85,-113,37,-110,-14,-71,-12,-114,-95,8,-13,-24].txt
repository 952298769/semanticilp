topographic gradient (degree of slope) - relative position of soils on the slope - orientation of the hill slope (aspect) north facing vs south facing slopes 38 Page 39 WEATHERING AND SOILS CONTROLS ON SOIL FORMATION 5) Time short time - thin soils - soil resembles parent long time - thick extensive soil development - soil loses characteristics \nof parent over time &#9; 39 Page 40 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE - soil forming processes begin at the surface and work downwards - the upper layer of soil is more altered from the parent material than the layers below - variations in texture, structure, composition and color define soil horizons &#9; 40 Page 41 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE - a vertical profile through soil horizons constitute a soil profile - 4 basic soil horizons O, A, B, C &#9; 41 Page 42 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE O Horizon - organic rich, decomposed leaf litter (humus) A Horizon - contains more humus than lower horizons - characterized by intense biological activity - characterized by eluviation (removal of clay size particles) and leaching (soluble minerals) &#9; 42 Page 43 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE B Horizon - transition between the topsoil and weathered bedrock - low organic matter content and fewer organisms - zone of accumulation (illuviation) of eluviated and leached materials - clay and fine particles enhances water retention also creates an impermeable layer (hardpan)&#9;43 Page 44 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE C Horizon - layer directly above the unweathered bedrock - consist of partially weathered rock (regolith) with almost no organic matter - original character of parent material is easily identifiable &#9;44 Page 45 WEATHERING AND SOILS THE SOIL PROFILE -
