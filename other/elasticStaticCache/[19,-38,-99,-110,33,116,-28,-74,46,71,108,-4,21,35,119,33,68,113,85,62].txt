Attenuated - microorganisms with reduced ability to cause disease Avirulent - microorganisms that do not cause disease Opportunistic - microorganisms that may or may not cause disease generally colonize , but do not infect, the host when usually found associated with a host, called normal microbiota can cause disease if they are inadvertently introduced into a site where they do not usually reside, especially inside host tissues Koch's Postulates If a microorganism is the causative (etiologic) agent of an infectious disease, it must be: Present in every case of the disease, but absent from the healthy host Isolated and grown in pure culture Able to Cause the disease when a pure culture is inoculated into a healthy host Re-isolated from the host that was inoculated with the pure culture Steps in Pathogenesis To cause disease, a pathogen must : Contact the host - be transmissible Colonize the host - adhere to and grow or multiply on host surfaces Infect the host - proliferate in host cells or tissues Evade the host defense system - by avoiding contact that will damage it Damage host tissues - by physical (mechanical) or chemical means Virulence Factors Factors responsible for the virulence of a microorganism because they influence its ability to cause disease by affecting its invasiveness and/or its toxigenicity Adhesins - enable parasites to attach to host cells or tissues Invasins - enable parasites to enter and/or move through host cells or tissues Evasins - enable parasites to escape from host defenses Toxins - enable parasites to damage host cells Epidemiology Principles Definitions Epidemiology - study of the occurrence of disease in a human population, especially the cause ( etiology ) and transmission of disease Epidemic - literally, \"upon the people\" ( epi = upon;",1.782872200012207],["These disease- causing microorganisms are also referred to as infectious agents or infectious substances and the materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials.",1.7793521881103516]]
