home and business wastes from urban areas - primarily paper, paperboard, and yard wastes - most potentially renewable resources - 13% recycled / 87% landfilled or burned Waste management - throwaway/high-waste approach - - solid wastes are left where they are produced, buried, or burned - based on an economic system that encourages waste production and then attempts to manage the wastes in manners that minimize environmental harm Waste prevention - low-waste approach - based on greatly increased recycling, reuse, and waste reduction Burying wastes: sanitary landfills - account for 73% of US wastes - spread in thin layers, compacted, and covered with clays - can be put into operation quickly with low operating costs and can handle large quantities of wastes - areas can be reclaimed as recreational areas when closed - \ntend to be noisy, high traffic flow, and dusty - landfill materials slow to decompose due to compacting, lack of oxygen and water - anaerobic respiration of bacteria produces methane, hydrogen sulfides, and organic compounds - may be collected as fuels Burning: - kills pathogens, reduces volume by 60%, reduces the need for landfill space, and does not require a change in peoples' habits - releases air and gaseous pollutants and generate toxic fly ash and bottom ash - volume decreased but toxicity increased - trash-to-energy - trash burned to generate steam which may be converted to electricity - most mass-burned - everything burned together without separating out hazardous materials Extending resource use through composting, recycling, reusing, reducing HAZARDOUS WASTES Hazardous waste is any discarded material (some 23 tons/person) that: contains one or more of 39 toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic compounds above tolerant limits is flammable is reactive or unstable enough to explode or release toxic fumes is capable of corroding metal containers Does not include radioactive wastes, household wastes, mining wastes, oil and gas drilling wastes, hydrocarbon-containing wastes, cement kiln dusts, municipal incinerator ash, small quantity generators, and the military Dealing with hazardous waste: Don t make them in the first place (pollution prevention) or use less harmful alternatives recycle or reuse them detoxify them burn them hide them in landfills, ponds, pits, deep wells, or dumping them in the ocean Bioremediation: using biological organisms to break down hazardous wastes U.S. HAZARDOUS WASTE REGULATIONS Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA): passed by congress in 1976 and reauthorized in 1984 requires the EPA to identify hazardous wastes and set standards for their management provides guidelines for state programs all facilities that store, treat and/or dispose of more than 100 kg of hazardous waste/month must have a permit requires a \"cradle-to-grave\" manifest to keep track of wastes transferred from the point-of-origin to approved off-site disposal facilities 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA): commonly referred to as Superfund established a $16.3 billion fund financed by state and federal governments and taxes on hazardous chemicals and industry moneys used for cleanup of abandoned or inactive hazardous waste sites and leaking tanks identified as threats to human health and the environment EPA authorized to collect fines and sue owners of abandoned sites and tanks to cover up to 3X cleanup costs 1200 sites on the National Priority List -
