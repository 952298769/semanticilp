It just changes. So what happens to the energy in a dropped basketball? The movement of a bouncing ball involves both potential and kinetic energy. As the ball changes positions in its path to the floor and back up again, the energy changes from potential to kinetic and back, but some of the energy changes forms and is transferred out of the ball, decreasing the energy the ball had when it was first dropped. For example, when the ball hits the court, it makes a sound--that sound is a result of a transfer of energy. The court (or ground) also absorbs some of the energy from the impact of the ball--the energy in the ball is transferred to the court. Another form of energy is heat energy.
