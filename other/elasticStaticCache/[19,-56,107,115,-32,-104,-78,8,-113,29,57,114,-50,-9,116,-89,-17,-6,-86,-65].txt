do) Allow irrigation water to evaporate... leaving the dissolved solids behind in the soil AND/OR Allow irrigation water to infiltrate without drainage water table rises soil is exposed to groundwater

the cut ends, this is due to root pressure by osmosis and other forces identified a pulling force due to evaporation of water through leaves and stems Today's Explanation: Cohesion-Tension Theory - H2O molecules are polar and due to these negatively and positively charged ends, H2O molecules are able to hydrogen bond (or cohere) to one another and adhere to capillary walls permitting an amount of tension as water transpires, a &quot;pull&quot; or tension is formed on water columns, drawing from one water molecule to another throughout the xylem cells Translocation - movement of food substances in solution (water) by the phloem Pressure flow hypothesis - the theory that food substances in solution in plants flow along concentration gradients between the sources of the food and
