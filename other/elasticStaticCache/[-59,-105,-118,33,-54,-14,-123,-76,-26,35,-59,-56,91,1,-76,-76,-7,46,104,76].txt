They usually indicate fair weather. Sometimes they grow very large and become thunderheads. As these clouds gather they create thunder and lightning and produce precipitation in the form of rain and hail. _ Cirrus clouds are thin, curly, wispy clouds. They are sometimes referred to as mares’ tails. They form between 25,000 to 40,000 feet above the ground. They are so high in the atmosphere that the water droplets freeze into ice crystals. They often indicate an incoming storm or weather change. There are cloud charts that you can buy to show what these clouds look like. However, most cloud charts will have more than these basic clouds. They use the prefixes “alto” and “nimbo” to tell more about these three basic clouds. If the prefix “alto” is used, it means middle, referring to the position of the clouds in their respective areas. If they use prefix “nimbo” is used, it means water and these clouds will often bring rain. Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. draw and describe the basic types of clouds; and 2. show a four-day observation of the clouds in the locality. Materials crayons, cotton balls, glitters for lighting and rain, paper and scissors glue Procedure A. Motivation/Presentation 1. Ask the pupils about the weather the other day. 2. Tell the pupils that in the next three (3) days they will observe the clouds and weather. They will go out for a total of four days for this activity. 3.
