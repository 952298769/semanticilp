Students will be asked to close their eyes and picture in their minds the story that is being read to them When reading is completed the students will be allowed to discuss feelings they experienced Activity 4: Construct a Life Cycle of A Butterfly Cut a sheet of construction paper into strips that are 3x8 inches wide and divide the paper into four equal sections Punch one hole in the top of the paper and tie a piece of yarn through the hole Cut a leaf shape from green construction paper Glue the leaf to the \nfirst box and glue one pea to the leaf (egg) Glue some bits of green yarn in the

tie pasta with a marker, tie a small piece of pipe cleaner around the pasta, and glue two wiggle eyes to the front of the pasta Glue this piece of pasta to the bottom section of the paper (butterfly) Discuss with the students the life cycle that the butterfly goes through Activity 5: M&amp;M Camouflage Game Before the activity is begun the instructor will mix together in a bowl M&amp;M's and candy corn so that the yellow and orange M&amp;M's are camouflaged Allow each student to pick out of the bowl the first five M&amp;M's that they see Instruct the students to NOT eat the M&amp;M's until the activity is concluded Once each student has chosen their candy make a tally of the number of each color In most circumstances the orange and yellow M&amp;M's will have lower numbers because they blend in with the candy corn Discuss why some colors were chosen more often than others have students relate this to nature and how this could be helpful to insects Activity 6: Hidden butterflies Instructor will place butterfly shapes around the room so that the shapes blend into background, do not hide butterfly shapes, they should be in plain sight Make some butterflies easier to see than others so that students can discuss the difference Ask the students if they have noticed anything different around the room Once the students have discovered the camouflaged butterflies begin to discuss how real butterflies are colored in nature for protection Have students give reasons for this coloring and list the ideas on the classroom chart Activity 7: Predator Prey Game Take campers to the wooded area Blind fold one student who will be the predator The predator counts to 20 while the other students (or prey) hides Hiding students must be able to see some part of the predator at all times, once students have found a hiding place they must stay in that place Predator removes blindfold and looks for prey, predator must stay in the same place and is only allowed to look around When predator spots the prey he/she points and calls out their name The prey is then out and must come and sit down next to the predator without talking After five minutes, if the predator has not found all the prey the blindfold is put back on the predator and the prey has to move 10 steps closer The blindfold is taken off again if at this time the predator cannot find the prey the game is over The last
