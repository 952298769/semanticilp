actor, but benefits the recipient naturally, these terms are just shorthand they don't necessarily imply any understanding or emotion on the part of the animals and since it is very difficult to really measure reproductive success without a large, expensive, long-term project in which we count the number of surviving offspring over several years, primatologists usually substitute shorter-term costs or benefits like exposure to predators or increased access to food assuming that, in general, these will have the expected positive or negative effects on reproductive success, which is what really matters Not surprisingly, \"selfish\" behavior is common in competition for food, mates, etc. \"mutualistic\" behavior also occurs, but is harder to observe than you might think two individuals grooming each other two individuals hunting together Also not surprisingly, \"spiteful\" behavior is rare, since it reduces the reproductive success the actor what is surprising is that primates engage in a lot of \"altruistic\" behavior it seems obvious that selection would not favor a tendency to do something that would reduce the actor's reproductive success and increase another's say some individuals sacrifice their lives to protect others from predators you would think that their \"altruistic\" genes would quickly be eliminated from the population, as they die off and others, who

itself and increasing its risk of predation while benefiting the others by improving their chances to escape an individual backs up another in a conflict an individual shares food with another etc. even if a behavior helps the group as a whole, ordinary selection would not favor it say some individuals have an allele that makes them prone to give a warning calls when they see a predator it is not unrealistic to suggest that a tendency to give warning calls could be influenced by one (or several) alleles for example, the \"warning call\" allele might cause a higher production of adrenaline,
