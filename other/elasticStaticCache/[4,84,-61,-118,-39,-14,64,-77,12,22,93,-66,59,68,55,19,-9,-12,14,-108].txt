Lecture Outline Chapter 28 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline HUMANITY VERSUS THE EARTH Effects of Human Population Visible at Great Distance fig 28.1 Population Impacts the Environment Total population of the earth in 1995 reached 5.7 billion More people consume more food, water, energy and raw materials More people create greater amount of waste A GROWING POPULATION Historical Perspective Earliest fossils from Europe are 500,000 years old Humans spread to North America 12,000 years ago Population 10,000 years ago was only 5 million With agriculture, populations rapidly expanded More dependable sources of food fig 28.2 Development of towns and cities Bubonic plague in 1348 killed nearly four-fifths of population fig 28.3 Recovery and increase to 500 million by 1650 Seventeenth century Renaissance renewed interest in science Scientific developments led to Industrial Revolution The Present Situation Global birth rate for last 300 years: 30 per year per 1000 people Present rate decreased slightly to 25 per 1000 Decreased death rate to 9 per 1000 people per year Net increase in annual population rate Population increasing \nat rate of 1.6% per year Will double population in 43 years Annual increase of 90 million per year Increase per minute of 170 people United Nation estimates population of 6 billion by 2000 AD Expected stabilization at 8.5 to 18 billion by 2090 Must stabilize population due to limited resources The Future Situation Localization of human populations in year 2000 60% in tropical or subtropical regions 20% in China 20% in developed or industrialized nations People in industrialized areas control 85% of wealth and materials Standard of living 20 times higher Lower infant mortality rate Higher life expectancy Variable world age structure affects population growth Industrialized nations: 20% of population under 15 years Developing countries have nearly twice as many fig 28.4 Populations of developing countries will continue to grow faster Industrialized nations will constitute smaller portion of the global population Quality of life dependent on stabilizing world`s population THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE Immediate World Challenge to Produce More Food Food production increased by 2.6 times since 1950 Population expanded at greater rate Most cultivatable land already in use Topsoil lost from agricultural land Consumption in developed countries increasing at greater rate Must Increase Agricultural Productivity Identify new crops, especially in tropics Major crops have been cultivated for thousands of years Few new plants cultivated since 1800 Examples: rubber and oil palms Crops selected for ease of growth Kinds of Agricultural Crops Three primary food crops: corn, wheat, rice 5000 types have ever been used for food, only 150 used regularly Various plants used for medical treatments Reasons for cultivating new plants Altered standards of cultivation Extraction of industrial products, oils, drugs, chemicals The Prospects for More Food Must increase productivity of current crops Improvement needed in tropical and subtropical regions Improvement of strains via Green Revolution: 1950-1970 Ten-fold increase in Mexican wheat production Food production in India outpaced population growth China became self-sufficient in food production Limitations of Green Revolution Agricultural techniques require great energy output Extensive use of costly pesticides and herbicides Commercial prices held low in developing areas Present solutions Improve production of current crops Not likely to bring more land into agricultural use Fully apply traditional means of plant breeding and selection fig 28.6 Include wheat, corn and rice Develop new crops in tropics and subtropics Develop improved strains via genetic engineering Resistance to specific herbicides results in better weed control Tolerance to soil conditions and mineral toxicity Ability to fix nitrogen Use of hydroponic agriculture problematic Resources of oceans are not inexhaustible Reduce over fishing of specific areas Develop new microorganism-based foods: Spirulina OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Nuclear Power Chernobyl incident One of four reactors exploded in April 1986 Emergency safety systems shut off Power surge precipitated the explosion Released over 100 megatons of radioactivity Millions of times greater than Three Mile Island Significant human exposure to radiation Death due to radiation poisoning The promise of nuclear power Fossil fuels no longer cheap sources of energy Nuclear power could provide new source Undesirable side effects to burning fossil fuels Produces sulfur and carbon dioxide New problems associated with nuclear power Safe operation of power plants Disposal of radioactive wastes Safe decommission of power plants Prevention of terrorism and sabotage Important to develop other alternative energy sources Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming CO2 in atmosphere maintains world temperature 25% higher than without it Traps heat-producing infrared light Creates greenhouse effect Associated with increased energy use Most gas from burning of fossil fuels Burning of forests also increases atmospheric gas Global warming results from increased CO2 Mean global temperature increased 1% since 1900 Masked by heat-absorbing capacity of oceans Level of CO2 could double by 2035 Warming exacerbated by trace gases Include chlorofluorocarbons Absorb infrared wavelengths better than CO2 Ancillary problems Rising sea levels Altered growth rates in plants Leads to global climate change Pollution Example: Rhine river Fire in chemical warehouse washed chemicals into river Deadly mercury and pesticides killed fish and plants Water became unsafe to drink River slowly cleaned itself The Threat of Pollution Results from industrial byproducts Plastics cannot decompose Efforts being made to develop new microorganisms yet unsuccessful Water pollution Not enough water to dispose of wastes Detergents increase algae, decrease water quality Agricultural pollution Widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers fig 28.7 Toxic chemicals remain in ecosystems Chlorinated hydrocarbons banned in U.S. Concentrate in the food chain Must develop responsible attitude toward use of chemicals Acid Precipitation Sulfur compounds produced when coal burned fig 28.8 Mixes with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid Acid dispersed by winds high up in atmosphere Effects seen far from where acids are produced Biological consequences Death of thousands of fresh water lakes fig 28.9 Seepage into groundwater Destruction of forests fig 28.10 Expensive to capture and remove emissions The Ozone Hole Visible to electronic equipment over Antarctica fig 28.11 Hole is nearly the size of the U.S. Thinning of ozone layer first appeared in 1975 Presence of hole coincides with Antarctic spring Cause of ozone hole attributed to chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) Chemicals used in cooling, fire extinguishers and styrofoam CFC`s reduce O3 ozone molecule to O2 gas Global agreements to halt CFC production Problem will get worse because of quantity currently in lower atmosphere that will reach upper atmosphere in later years Biological consequences Increased ultraviolet light penetration Increases incidence of human skin cancers Damage to photosynthetic plankton Destruction in the Tropics Traditional method of shifting agriculture fig 28.12 Crops grow for only a few years in poor soils Require decades without crops to rebuild nutrients High population density does not permit renewal No longer sufficient for even traditional manioc crop Dead materials collected for firewood, not recycled Forests being cleared at too great a rate Equal to the size of Indiana per year At the present rate they will be gone in thirty years Need to change from one-use to \ncontinuous agriculture fig 28.13 The Loss of Biodiversity Serious and rapidly accelerating problem Given the loss of species of known plants and animals Given the loss of habitat, especially in tropics Calculate loss of 20% of biodiversity within in next 30 years Loss greater considering we have named only 15% of world's eukaryotic organisms Loss important for several reasons Moral, ethical and aesthetic grounds Organisms necessary to sustain our own existence Opportunity to study them lost Also lose potential benefits of these organisms Upset balance of living communities and their physical environment Effect soils, water regulation, nutrient cycles, atmosphere and climate, absorb pollution Creating conditions of instability and unproductivity Little known about overall ecology of communities and ecosystems Cannot replace with systems that will support humans Damage is currently irreparable ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Attempts to Find Solutions to Environmental Problems Studied by environmental scientists Applied science associated with ecology, geology, meteorology Environmental Problems Can Be Solved fig 28.14 Assessment Gathering information Construct model of situation Use model to predict future events Risk analysis Analyze environmental impact Evaluate potential for solving problem Determine adverse effects of solution Public education Address problem in terms the public can understand Present alternative actions Explain costs and results of various choices Political action Choice made through elected officials Difficult to implement if multinational problems Follow-through Monitor results of environmental actions Evaluate and improve initial analysis and modeling WHAT BIOLOGISTS HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE Environmental Problems Require Applications of Biological Principles All living things need to use energy of the sun Need to understand basic principles and their

Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living Some form symbiotic relationships with plants Fix enough nitrogen to be of significance Plants can grow in soils with low amounts of nitrogen Bacteria and fungi rapidly decompose nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively insoluble and contained in only certain kinds of rocks Weather out of rocks, transported to oceans Brought up by natural uplift of land masses or by marine animals Form rich natural deposits of guano from sea birds Millions of tons of phosphates added to farm land each year Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is called superphosphate Made by treating calcium phosphate with sulfuric acid Biogeochemical Cycles Illustrated: Recycling in a Forested Ecosystem Evidence in studies of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Central stream of large temperate deciduous forest \nwatershed Measure water and nutrient flow made through concrete weirs Conclusions: undisturbed watershed efficiently retained nutrients Instructive with regard to loss of rainforest area to crops Experimental felling of trees and shrubs in one of six watersheds Amount of water runoff increased by 40% Amount of nutrients lost was greatly increased Conclusion: fertility lost, danger of flooding increased THE FLOW OF ENERGY Ecosystems Contain Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Autotrophs capture light energy and manufacture own food Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs Energy captured is slowly released through metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs, sugarcane fields = 3600 to 9100 grams/year Intertidal zone = 14,600 grams/year Trophic Levels Green plants convert 1% of the sun`s energy Less energy converted by the animals that eat plants Levels of consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids cannot be inverted ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION Succession: Ecosystems Have a Tendency to Change from Simple to Complex Cleared land becomes occupied by larger and more diverse plants Small pond becomes filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of autotrophs Organisms at later stages are more specialized than earlier organisms [Return to Chapter 26 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to Biology Home Page] Search | How to Order | E-mail

come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.6306572556495667],["resource

&quot;input&quot; methods to reduce materials waste and prevent pollution produce no waste except heat exceed the capacity of the earth to dilute waste and absorb excess heat rely only on nonpolluting solar energy The greatest diversity of animal species is found in tropical rainforests because: mammals thrive on the hot, humid climate the complex structure of the rain forest provides more niches these rainforests contain no predators the water supply in these forests is rich in nutrients both a and d are true The process whereby atmospheric nitrogen is transformed into a usable form by plants is called: solvation denitrification Rhizobium nitrolysis nitrogen fixation The carbon cycle involves: atmospheric carbon dioxide the carbon in molecules of living organisms carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water carbon in limestone all of the above The soil of tropical rainforests is generally unsuitable for agriculture because: most nutrients are in the profuse vegetation instead of the soil potassium is leached from the soil by runoff from heavy rains plant roots make it difficult to plow the soil forest plants secrete material toxic for crops more than one of the above Populations tend

decreases the returns to labor In a given area, agriculture can produce more food overall, and so feed more people But they have to work harder than before to survive There is an old idea that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of civilization Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around stored food, fields, canals, etc. may need to be defended In some particularly good environments, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places agriculture, on the other hand, allows people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Less mobile mothers don't have to carry their small children constantly, encouraging them to stop breast feeding sooner this shortens the period of reduced fertility due to breast feeding Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Agriculture also provides economic incentives to have more children Farming creates a greater demand for labor, that is, kids to help with the work So farmers tend to have large families, and the population tends to grow Soon they are locked in: people can't give up farming without causing hardship or starvation because there are more people than the available land could support by foraging So the shift to farming is to some extent a one-way change there is no going back without unacceptable disaster Agriculture and sedentism have surprising effects on nutrition and health agriculture, especially in its early stages, often focuses on one or a small number of the most productive crops this results in a less varied diet than foragers eat and often poorer nutrition overall more carbohydrates lead to more dental caries (cavities), abscesses, etc. - a serious matter before modern dentistry more labor leads to more arthritis and other wear-and-tear ailments living in permanent villages creates new problems of sanitation (waste disposal, insect infestation, etc.) that encourage disease living in larger groups aids the spread of epidemic diseases ovarall, settled agricultural lifestyles typically increase biological stress on people and often decrease lifespan more children are produced, but they have a shorter life expectancy in theory, these two trends could cancel each other out but the observed pattern is that in most or all cases, the net effect is still a population increase Agriculture and sedentism have cultural effects, too: Agriculture requires investment of labor to make a plot of land productive land that has been cleared, tilled, etc. is more valuable than the rest of the countryside so people will tend to claim ownership of improved land, and become tied to it for at least a season, and often longer Sedentism allows accumulation of material goods: storage of goods and food thus the origins of rich and poor people and classes so sedentism makes economic stratification possible accumulation is not limited to a single generation, either;",0.5871580839157104],["limits on deductions on vacation homes cap on what percentage can be taken, if you are there less than 14

from which resources are drawn Areas with rich agricultural hinterlands supported the growth of cities Today, hinterlands extend much further Cities may draw on natural resources great distances from where they are located Impacts on Hinterland Creation of the hinterland disturbs natural ecosystems Farming removed native vegetation (forest cover, for example) and replaced it with selected plants Disrupted nutrient cycles (declining soil fertility) Deteriorated soil structure Removed wildlife habitat Altered hydrologic cycle (increased runoff and percolation) Polluted water and air If impacts was severe enough, it could threaten the life of the city (fertile crescent) Modern Impacts on Hinterland Despite the apparent impacts of farming on the natural environment, it pales in comparison to the impacts of the modern city on surrounding areas Industrial revolution increased the amount of energy required and waste generated in the city Industrial revolution was also a chemical revolution On the farm, increased use of inorganic fertilizers Loss of biodiversity with introduction of hybrid crops In industry, new chemical compounds and high concentrations placed new threats on ecosystems Growing Hinterland The new economy and increasing size of cities expanded the size of the hinterland Technological revolutions, especially in transportation, allowed the import of materials (and export of waste) further and further away from cities Today it is very difficult to delineate an urban hinterland Consider, for example, where your next meal originated, or what materials were required to make your clothes Ecological Footprint Despite the difficulty in defining a hinterland, it is important that we be able to define the geographical impact of cities on the world In terms of land, they clearly take up little space (in the US, 75 percent of the population lives on 2 percent of the land) But the amount of land required to support a city is clearly much greater Support includes both inputs and outputs (a city could not exist unless it had somewhere to dump its garbage, for example) One way we can measure the amount of space necessary to support a city is to measure its ecological footprint Ecological Footprint The ecological footprint concept tries to measure how much nature people consume Calculates the number of acres required to support a population the ecological footprint of any defined population (from a single individual to a whole city or country) is the total area of ecologically productive land and water occupied exclusively to produce all the resources consumed and to assimilate all the wastes generated by that population, using prevailing technology.",0.5376471877098083],["Chemical-Free Yard &amp; Garden , Rodale Press, 1991 The following

Help",0.5224094986915588],["Agriculture is a devil's bargain You get more food per acre But you get less food per hour of work In economic terms, agriculture increases the returns to land, but decreases the returns to labor In a given area, agriculture can produce more food overall, and so feed more people But they have to work harder than before to survive There is an old idea that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of complex society Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around Under some circumstances, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places we will see that these special circumstances may have been keys to the initial development of agriculture in certain favored locations agriculture, on the other hand, allows and encourages people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Less mobile mothers may wean children sooner;",0.5149810314178467],["Scientists are puzzled by the healthy state of the dead

&quot;civilizations&quot; don't seem to arise on their own Some key ideas about agriculture Agriculture provides more food per unit area of land, compared to foraging That is, you get more food per acre by farming it than by collecting the wild foods on it This allows more people to live in a given area That is, it allows a higher density of people Of course, it takes more labor to farm an acre of land than to collect the wild foods that are naturally there This process of putting in more labor per acre to get more product per acre out is called &quot;intensification&quot; agriculture is more &quot;intensive&quot; than foraging in that it produces food more per acre, but requires more labor per acre to do so agricultural practices themselves can be more or less &quot;intensive&quot; just scattering seeds or diverting floodwaters to wet some land does not take much labor, and is not a very \"intensive\" form of agriculture building and maintaining canals to irrigate the fields is more &quot;intensive&quot; than just depending on rainfall if people begin to gather and use fertilizer in order to increase yields, they are &quot;intensifying&quot; their agricultural practices because they are getting more crops per acre at the cost of collecting, hauling, and applying the fertilizer Is farming a good deal?",0.4743972718715668],["dimensions global change, causes global

distribution depends upon the distribution of resource ownership improper channeling of resources is self-correcting income differences from differences in resource ownership are not self-correcting society can impose forced corrections: taxes, subsidies, institutional changes (4) Short-run Rationing: making supplies last Here, the economic system makes provisions for rationing commodities over the time period during which supplies cannot be changed known as \"short-run\" or \"market period\" rationing supply must be spread over consumers supply must be stretched over a time period until the next harvest (5) \nEconomic Maintenance and Growth Every economy must maintain and expand its productive capacity Maintenance : keeping the productive power operating through provisions for depreciation Expansion : continuous increase in kind and quantity of the nation s resources, together with continuous technological improvement Agricultural Economics The agricultural economist applies the analytical models of economics to agricultural problems old definition of agriculture: the science and art of farming sophisticated production techniques, products marketed all over the world agricultural inputs and storage are both now a major portion of our economy Agricultural Economics Ag economics was originally begun as a study of costs and returns for farms mainly dealt with management problems modern field is composed of specialists who study ag marketing, farm management, agricultural finance, accounting, product transportation, farm cooperatives and ag law many study more than one aspect Agricultural Economics Both major areas of economics (micro - and macro-) have applications in agriculture the problems of production on individual farms are important also, agriculture is not really independent of the other areas of the economy budgetary decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board send shock waves back through the agribusiness marketing system to every farmer Agricultural Economics The logic of economics is not the whole of agricultural economics to be effective the ag economist must also understand the biological nature of agricultural production if you study the costs of fish farming enterprises, you must also understand the technical management problems of animal husbandry the best practitioners of the art of ag economics are those who both understand theory and know how to use it in a practical setting Goal of Agriculture Economics Widely accepted goal is to increase efficiency in agriculture Basic goal is to produce the needed food and fiber without wasting resources to meet this goal, the required output must be produced with the smallest amounts of scarce resources our goal: increasing efficiency, profitability, and efficiency of resource use in all society Production Economics Production economics: the application of the principles of microeconomics in agriculture studying production principles should clarify, for the farmer, issues such as costs, output response to input and the use of resources to maximize profit/minimize costs production economics is multi-disciplinary resulted from agronomists looking beyond the biology of production Production Economics: Questions to be Answered What is efficient production?",0.4586620032787323],["The dry forest ecosystems of Costa Rica: are being effectively reestablished in a national park have been replaced by local farms are easily destroyed by fire are being replaced by introduced grasses favored by cattle ranchers more than one of the above is true The municipal utility of Osage, Iowa, launched an ambitious energy conservation program because: the citizens of Osage had voted to rely only on local energy resources the U.S. government had announced a new policy to encourage energy efficiency nationwide the increase in oil prices in the 1970s had made providing energy services to the community much more costly the people of Osage have always prided themselves on their spirit of self-sacrifice more than one of the above is true The main reason the Volvo LCP 2000 is more efficient than present cars is: its reduced weight means that less energy is required to move it its versatile engine can run on fuels other than gasoline its seating capacity is more limited its aerodynamic design eliminates friction from the air more than one of the above is true Brazil launched its national alcohol fuels program primarily to: set an example for other developing countries create a source of liquid fuel that the country s poor could afford reduce the country s bill for imported oil reduce the country s contribution to the greenhouse effect more than one of the above is true The most valuable tool shown to get people in Osage, Iowa to conserve energy was: the high cost of electricity the installation of insulating blankets around water heaters coupled with lowering of thermostats infrared photographs of all residences showing areas of heat loss tax incentives to save energy increasing the efficiency of local industries The world s most extensive remaining fossil-fuel resource is: oil renewable biomass fuels uranium gas coal American agriculture moved to mechanized, high-input farming because: new labor-saving machines were invented implements powered by draft animals were too slow and inefficient for farming large acreages the newer methods required less human labor farmers were bribed by manufacturers of chemical fertilizers more than one of the above is true The use of chemical fertilizers poses environmental risks because: most fertilizers do not provide all the necessary plant nutrients fertilizers are not readily soluble in rainwater when washed from fields, fertilizers can lead to eutrophication of surface water fertilizers are toxic to trees and other forest plants fertilizers are too expensive for most farmers to afford The organic farm in North Dakota shown in &quot;Save the Earth Feed the World&quot; shows that: organic farming, though stable, cannot compete with conventional farms farms using low-input approaches can be productive and profitable fertilizer industry representatives are convinced by low-input methods farms using low-input approaches can be productive but not profitable only farmers who have always farmed organically are likely to succeed with low-input approaches Bukrina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, turned its food productivity around by: using modern technology developing a system of windbreaks using the \ngreen revolution developing a series of low stone checkdams for water harvesting using integrated pest management Sanitary landfills: were once widely used for waste disposal but not have been largely abandoned are the largest destination for solid waste in the United States provide the only realistic alternative for waste disposal in industrial countries can be completely isolated from the surrounding environment more than one of the

bundles, covers on jars, or even doorways, so that they can't be tampered with which is useful if you are storing valuable goods that someone or some institution owns or controls access to so, like the central storage buildings, these stamp seals suggest private property, exchange, or communal storage both the shared storage and the stamp seals suggest an increasingly complex economy Halaf style

towards the \"neck\" of Mesopotamia this may have been some combination of people actually moving into the area and a possible low density population of foragers who were already there and began to

least one crop that would not have produced at all in this region without irrigation: flax (linseed) for fiber used in linen cloth sites are found in the areas where natural flooding could be most easily channeled and drained sites are lined up along contour lines, implying that they lay along shared canals as we saw before, irrigation suggests intensification more investment in the land more permanent settlement maybe land ownership greater vulnerability to attack and need for defense maybe greater needs to coordinate work, set up conflict resolution institutions, etc. but this can all still happen in pretty small-scale societies, without necessarily having strong leadership or very complex social organization largest sites were only around 6 ha (site of Samarra) about three times

put into plasmids or virus vehicles Fragment replicated with vehicle genome Stage 3: Cloning Fragment-containing vehicles introduced into bacteria Bacteria reproduce making identical replicas Each cell line maintained separately Whole set constitutes clone library of original DNA Stage 4: Screening Identify clone line containing fragment of interest Among most difficult and critical steps Preliminary Screening of Clones Eliminate bacteria not containing proper DNA fragment Use genes conferring antibiotic resistance fig 19.7a Eliminate bacteria without vehicle Culture clones on medium containing antibiotic Only bacteria resistant to antibiotic will grow on it Eliminate bacteria with vehicle, but lacking fragment Use vector with gene that enables cell to metabolize X-gal sugar Metabolism of X-gal produces blue product Cells with vector and functional gene will turn blue fig 19.7b Test clones for presence of X-gal metabolism Clones with fragment lose ability to metabolize sugar DNA fragment within gene makes it inoperative Cells remain colorless in presence of X-gal Finding the Gene of Interest fig 19.8 Clone library may contain thousands of DNA fragments Southern blot

escaping and hiding from avian predators such as hawks or other owls only territorial during breeding season and will occasionally live in colonies while raising young prefer a distance of approximately 109 m between nesting burrows males defend territory and do not come into physical contact with intruders until they are closer than about 10 m to the burrow food availability often determines how territorial the birds are Unique Features: exceptional eyesight and hearing burrows are often considered an adaptation to warm temperatures typical of their habitat avoid the hot prairie sun by staying underground underground nesting makes them more susceptible to predation from coyotes, foxes, etc. females and young are able to make a rasping sound, resembling the sound of a large rattlesnake, to scare off predators Activity Period: diurnal but most active at dusk and dawn Adaptability to Human Disturbance: generally, quite tolerant of human encroachment will nest in golf courses, vacant land on the outskirts of urban areas, and university campuses Environmental Threats: Collisions with Vehicles many owls are hit by cars on the highway owls often hunt along the ditches of gravel roads and are hit by vehicles Habitat Loss most influential factor on the population of the burrowing owl includes the control of burrowing mammal populations like the prairie dog prairie grassland is the preferred habitat of the Burrowing Owl, but is an endangered ecoregion Pesticide Use compounded by their proximity of nesting sites to agricultural areas Carbofuran is one chemical that is detrimental to Burrowing Owls and is now illegal to use in most countries primary food source is insects (mostly grasshoppers), owls ingest grasshoppers that have been treated with insecticides biomagnification of pesticides (increasing concentrations up the food chain) affects reproduction in the owls Rules of Conservation in Different Regions migration routes are often through Central and South American countries, where there are fewer regulations regarding pesticide use and continued use of harmful pesticides Population Status: in 1995, the Burrowing Owl status was upgraded from Threatened to Endangered Management and Outlook: as a result of its Endangered Species status in 1995, it has the focus of a variety of conservation efforts Operation Burrowing Owl and other projects involving habitat preservation with landowners have been created populations monitored by Fish and Wildlife departments reintroduced into the British Columbia interior, where it was extirpated outlook would improve if larger areas of habitat were preserved and harmful pesticides were banned in all areas of their range numbers could increase if an increased tolerance to burrowing mammals develops (i.e. badgers) provides homes for the Burrowing Owl Outlook: perilous Public Attitudes: in North America, in the past decades, the Burrowing Owl was often killed because it was associated with Prairie-Dogs or Ground Squirrels many were shot by accident because they were mistaken for Ground Squirrels many landowners are now willing to set aside some land for owls found nesting on their property to help protect these birds What You Can Do To Help: report any sightings of a Burrowing Owl to a local Fish and Wildlife office reduce or eliminate pesticide use around your home and/or farm, especially around active burrows become a member of Operation Burrowing Owl - volunteers in this program agree not to disturb nesting areas in ex change for recognition and a

were: The tax equity and free market parts of this approach are good This would help farmers compete with developers in the land market This approach addresses the root causes of loss of agricultural land The overall effect would be to strengthen the whole economy Farmers are more likely to invest in their land if they own all rights to a viable farm/have better business plans This is the choice that philosophically makes most sense/it involves less government interference A more stable agricultural economy would result in better farm business planning This avoids excessive government interference This approach may lower costs of farming Locally grown food leads to safer products for consumers This would meet the goal of nurturing rural community character and preserving scenic open space in the community The most frequently cited concerns about this approach were: There are forces in the economy that are beyond local control This approach is supposed to decrease government interference but, there is a possibility that government intervention in markets will increase This could result in more industrial agriculture This process is too slow Retail prices of agricultural goods will increase with this approach There is no way farms will compete with developers for land The following are suggestions for how this approach could be improved: Work to reduce the influence

function up or down Perfect Certainty Summary: Management decisions based on production functions can only be as accurate as the production functions themselves care must be given to select the appropriate production function select the right one or suffer the consequences for this class, we will assume that the pond farmer knows the outcome of the production process from the beginning (perfect certainty) Perfect Certainty Definition : knowing the outcome in advance examples: knowing the corn yields at various levels of fertilization, knowing pond yields at a certain protein level of feed on top of this, he/she also knows the cost of fertilizer, the cost of feed, and the price that the shrimp will bring Assumption 2: level of technology If you produce, it is assumed that you do it via a certain methodology or process unfortunately, a product can be produced in many ways we normally assume in production economics that the manager uses the most up-to-date technology it is the process that yields the most output from a given amount of input Assumption 3: length of time period The production function shows output at various levels of input over a specific length of time these resources can be either of a fixed or variable nature reasons for fixing a variable: 1) maybe the amount used is just the right amount, any more or less would lower profits 2) maybe the production time period is too short to change the amount of resource on hand (e.g., land) Assumption 3: length of time period 3) the farmer just may not want to change the amount of resource (e.g., not changing the number of dairy cattle in order to evaluate a feed effect) in the long run, the manager has the opportunity to change the level of usage of all inputs in the short run, he/she may not change this Assumption 3: length of time period Different Time Periods Studied 1) very short run: so short all resources are fixed 2) short run: length allows at least one resource to be varied (all others fixed) 3) long run: any and all resources can be varied this classification of time is often not satisfactory simply because the long run does no allow for adequate mgmt on the part of the farmer often the case is that the farmer is jumping from one short run to another and is always faced with some fixed inputs Assumption 3: Length of Time Period In the real world, the farmer is seldom thinking about whether he/she has a long run or short run production process he/she sizes up the farm business, decides which inputs should be increased or decreased and makes appropriate changes during the time he/she is trying to make a decision over buying another input (e.g., tractor) the number of tractors are fixed on the farm Back to the Classical Production Function There are several classical production function for various agricultural situations a discussion of all the production functions that now exist in agriculture would involve more space than any book could provide few are reported for aquaculture it would be impossible to record them all as they happen we are simply trying to gain a better understanding of input-output relations the result is general guidelines and indications useful to farm managers Back to the Classical Production Function The shape of the production function describes the change in output, Y, as increasing amounts of variable input, X, are added to a bunch of fixed inputs this figure demonstrates two general assumptions we ve already discussed: 1) the production function is a continuous curve 2) inputs and \noutputs are perfectly divisible The Classical Production Function If the production function did not have perfectly divisible inputs and outputs, it would look like a series of dots 3) inputs and outputs are homogenous all inputs on the horizontal axis are of equal quality all units of output on the vertical axis are of equal market value example: all catfish have same $/lb value Describing the Production Function Algebraically The algebraic equation for the production function shown in the previous table, graph is Y = X 2 - 1/30X 3 Y = units of output resulting from some number of units of X if we input any value for X, within the range of X s, there will result a corresponding Y value on the curve thus, Y values can be predicted by substitution Law of Diminishing Returns Originally developed by early economists to describe the relationship between output and a variable input, when other inputs are constant if increasing the amount of one input is added to a production process while all others are constant, additional output will eventually decrease implies there is a \"right\" level of variable input to use with the combination of fixed inputs Law of Diminishing Returns Requires that the method of production does not change as variable input changes does not apply when all inputs are varied when the LDR is applied to production you get the classical production function increasing marginal returns at first and decreasing marginal returns afterwards it is possible that marginal returns could decrease in the beginning with the first application of the variable input Three Stages of Production The classical production function can be divided into three stages: First Stage : this means the average rate at which variable input (X) is transformed into product (Y) increases until it reaches its maximum this maximum indicates the end of Stage 1 Production Stage 1 Stage 1 deals with increasing bang for your buck or the phase of increasing production efficiency production efficiency is not just the maximum production level efficiency (also known as average physical product) is determined by dividing yield by its corresponding amount of input (Y/X) Stage 1 ends where Y/X is largest, around 150 lbs input Production Efficiency Three Stages of Production Stage 2 : physical efficiency of the variable input is at a peak at the beginning of Stage 2 note: efficiency of fixed input is at its maximum at the end of Stage 2 output/unit fixed input is largest when production is maximum Three Stages of Production Stage 3 : result of excessive quantities of variable input combined with fixed inputs in order for all this to make sense, we need to understand that production functions are used to determine the most profitable amount of variable input and output the production function allows you to make recommendations about input use even when input/output prices are unknown Economic Recommendations 1) using logic you can see that if your production follows that of the example given, you should increase inputs to achieve a production level at least until Stage 2 is reached;",0.42118000984191895],["Often what the organization would like to do depends on

Benefits of Organic Farming by Mark Ruskell and Caroline Hoffman A definition of ORGANIC (from the international Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements): To produce food of high nutritional value in sufficient quality To work with natural systems rather than seeking to dominate them To encourage and enhance biological cycles within the farming system, involving micro-organisms, soil flora and fauna, plants and animals To maintain and increase the long-term fertility of soils To use as far as possible renewable resources in locally organised agricultural systems To work as much as possible within a closed system with regard to organic matter and nutrient elements To give all livestock conditions of life that allow them to perform all aspects of their innate behaviour To avoid all forms of pollution that may result from agricultural techniques To maintain the genetic diversity of the agricultural system and its surrounding, including the protection of plant and wildlife habitats To allow agricultural producers an adequate return and satisfaction from their work including a safe working environment To consider the wider social and ecological impact of the farming system Research evidence shows conclusively that organic farming is beneficial to the ENVIRONMENT as BIODIVERSITY has been increased by organic farming techniques.",0.4176526665687561],["Now add Dhaka to the list....

to improve views and the spraying of herbicides along the parkway could be abandoned as ecologically unsound practices, WHEREAS, the river water would be relieved of salt and herbicide contamination, reducing slightly the burden already carried by fish and other aquatic life, WHEREAS, the Niagara Waterfront Master Plan (1992) reported the Robert Moses Parkway as &quot;significantly underutilized,&quot; WHEREAS, the parkway is not a necessary north-south traffic route, there being alternates such as Main Street--Lewiston Road, Hyde Park Blvd., Military Road, and the I-90, WHEREAS, the parkway currently funnels traffic away from these thoroughfares, WHEREAS, trolleys, viewmobiles, horse-drawn carriages or other conveyances should be encouraged to ply routes through the city of Niagara Falls, New York, arriving at Whirlpool, Devil's Hole, and DeVeaux Woods State Parks by right angle access roads, WHEREAS, the economic climate of the business districts along these alternate routes would have the potential of dramatic improvement, particularly Main Street of Niagara Falls, New York, WHEREAS, hiking and biking trails replacing the parkway would enhance the Niagara region as an eco-tourist destination, WHEREAS, restored natural landscapes would enhance habitat for wildlife, and thus extend the season for the eco-tourist interested in birding during spring and fall migrations, and by increasing awareness of the presence of gulls during winter months, WHEREAS, the season would be further extended into winter as visitors and residents interested in cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, and other cold weather activities used the trails, WHEREAS, these trails would be the &quot;middle-passage&quot;

staying closer to springs-&gt; encouraging wild crops to grow near springs, increased storage-&gt; domestication, population rise, etc. i.e. driven by need to stay close to water people started as complex foragers they specialized in a few seasonal foods: cereals in spring nut-bearing trees (i.e. pistachio, almond, acorn) in fall also gazelle when they migrated past harvest times varied with elevation, so by moving up and down the mountains, foragers could stretch out food availability to cover the whole year drying climate reduced the availability of water, increasingly confining them to a limited choice of settlements near springs, making it difficult to move around to follow the wild harvest so they started encouraging cereals to grow in convenient areas near the springs, and storing the harvest for the off-season this domesticated the cereals allowed population to rise, they became dependent on agriculture, etc.... Comments: In this model, too, sedentism and storage come first, and agriculture and domestication follow as the archaeological evidence indicates and this one, too, would initially happen in a limited region, then agriculture would spread from there we will look at some of the other places where agriculture was adopted throughout the rest of the course This transition to farming made it possible

variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose we have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in \nthe country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of difficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons & \nnbsp;",0.4038561284542084]]
