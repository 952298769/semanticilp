range of languages for those who have no English, or English as a second language 3.6 to ensure the rights of consumers are upheld each person's autonomy will be respected along with their right to make decisions in consultation with others input from consumers will help to identify ways to improve access for consumers to the most appropriate health and disability services consumer
