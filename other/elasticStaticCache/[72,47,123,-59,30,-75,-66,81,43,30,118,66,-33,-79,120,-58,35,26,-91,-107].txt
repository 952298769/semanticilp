in the light of evolution&quot;--Theodosius Dobzhansky &quot;The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all&quot;--Sir Peter Medawar Biological Species Concept Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1963) Defines species in terms of the gene pool, isolated from other similar gene pools Paleospecies A paleospecies or chronospecies is a morphologically or anatomically defined fossil species Since interbreeding cannot be determined for fossil species, species boundaries are determined by similarity of form The more difference there is between two fossil critters, the more likely they are members of separate species In a long-lived lineage with continuous fossil representation, an arbitrary species line will be drawn when &quot;enough&quot; difference is seen Speciation The process by which new species are produced from earlier ones This is the central process of macroevolution, or evolution at the level of the species or above (genus, family, etc.) Microevolution involves evolutionary change at the level of the population, and is defined by changes in allele frequencies within the population The Origin of Species Speciation occurs when populations of a species become reproductively isolated so that they can no longer interbreed with full fertility Geographic isolation of populations usually initiates the process Separated by a river, desert, volcano, etc. Selection operates to produce isolating mechanisms of anatomy and behavior Modes of Evolution Cladogenesis is branching evolution, the production of two or more daughter species from a single ancestral species Anagenesis is linear evolution, the production of a single daughter species from a single ancestral species Tempo of Evolution Gradualism views evolutionary change as occurring at a slow, steady, incremental rate over time Punctuated Equilibrium views the tempo of evolution as consisting of long periods of stability (equilibrium), followed by relatively short periods of rapid evolutionary change (punctuations) The Evolutionary Record The Cosmos Big bang estimated to have occurred between 12 - 15 billion years ago Milky way galaxy formed approximately 10 billion years ago Our solar system coalesced about 5 billion years ago Planet earth formed about 4 billion years ago Azoic 4.5 - 3.8 billion years ago Inorganic chemical evolution Spontaneous formation of proto-DNA, and more likely RNA molecules from nucleotides Spontaneous formation of proteins from amino acids Linkage of the two forms of molecules, probably through the enzymatic action of RNA molecules Proterozoic 3.8 billion - 570 million years ago Origin of life on earth First prokaryotic cells Simple combination of DNA and protein surrounded by cell membrane No organelles, chromosomes, nucleus Eukaryotic cells evolve about \n1.8 billion years ago Cells with formed nucleus, organelles, chromosomes Paleozoic 570 - 225 mya Cambrian explosion Evolution of hard body parts increases fossil record Increasing numbers of multicelled organisms create more dynamic ecosystems New critters branch out into many new econiches including many new predatory niches Many new body plans are found Our Paleozoic ancestors Jawless fish: first vertebrates Armored fish, first fish with jaws Bony fish: jawed fish, bony skeleton Cartilaginous fish: skeleton of cartilage instead of bone Amphibians: lungs, legs to walk, reproduction tied to water Reptiles: water-proof skin, internal fertilization, hard-shell egg The Permian extinction Mass extinction episode at the end of the Paleozoic, about 225 million years ago Resulted from several factors including continental drift All land masses collide to form a single super-continent: Pangaea About half of all continental shelf habitats and econiches for marine organisms were lost Extinction of well over half of all marine invertebrates, eliminating major groups of marine organisms Mesozoic 225 - 65 mya Florescence of reptiles on land Continuing divergence of vertebrates Mammals: hair or fur, mammary glands, warm-blooded Birds: feathers, warm-blooded, complex sexual selection Major extinction event 65 million years ago Cretaceous/tertiary event included the extinction of dinosaurs Cretaceous/tertiary event Comet collision represented by the Chicxulub impact crater off the north west coast of the Yucatan peninsula Combined the effects of terrestrial and marine impact Dust, steam, and debris caused cooling, break down of food webs More than half of the living genera disappear at this time Terrestrial reptiles and marine invertebrates most heavily affected No land vertebrate larger than 50 pounds in body weight survived the K/T Small furry critters like our bug-eating ancestors survived Cenozoic since 65 mya Following the mass extinction, there was a major radiation of modern groups of mammals
