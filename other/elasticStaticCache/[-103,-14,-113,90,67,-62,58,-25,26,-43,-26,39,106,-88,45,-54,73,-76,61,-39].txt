In contrast, with a Z-linked trait (males ZZ, females ZW), females more often evolve mating preferences for mates carrying alleles beneficial to sons (that is, flashy displays). With sexual antagonism, chromosomal location should strongly affect the evolution of female preferences. Simply put, an X-linked male trait is never passed on from an attractive father to his sons, whereas his daughters suffer the cost of carrying the display trait. Offspring in XY species therefore do not gain a fitness benefit from females preferring males with a more extreme X-linked display trait. In contrast, both males and females contribute a Z chromosome to sons in ZW species.
