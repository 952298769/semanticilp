Photosynthesis, overall reaction (a) The overall reaction of photosynthesis may be described in shorthand as: (i) CO 2 + H 2 O + energy CH 2 O + O 2 (b) See Figure 10.3, Tracking atoms through photosynthesis (and, no, I don t expect you to know this figure, though do note that the actual reaction is perhaps more complex than expected with water appearing on both sides of the equation) (c) Note that here energy is light energy, i.e., photons (d) Note also that CH 2 O represents a one carbon unit of carbohydrate (recalling that carbohydrate molecules have more than one carbon) (e) In terms of glucose , the above equation may be written as: (i) 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + energy C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 (f) Note how this equation is essentially the reverse of the equation for the oxidation of
