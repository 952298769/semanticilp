emissions, down from 34 percent in 1970.1 Currently, vehicles on the road account for more than 25 percent of all air pollution nationwide.2 Pollution from vehicles contributes to two of our worst air pollution problems smog and carbon monoxide.3 On average, cars on the road emit three to four times more pollution than standards allow for new cars.3 New cars today are capable of emitting 90 percent less air toxics on a per-mile basis than the uncontrolled models of 1970.4 Each year, the average car causes over 600 pounds of air pollution.5 Transportation sources (including highway and off-highway vehicles) now account for 77 percent of national total carbon monoxide emissions.1 Motor vehicle exhaust contributes about 60 percent of all carbon monoxide emissions nationwide.1 Approximately 3.8 grams of volatile organic compounds are emitted by every car every day, even when they are not driven.2 Travel Trends: In 1996, congestion cost U.S. travelers 4.6 billion hours of delay, 6.7 billion gallons of wasted fuel, and $74 billion in time and fuel costs.6 Traffic congestion is no longer just a big city problem the amount of time commuters spend stalled in traffic in small and medium-sized cities has more than quadrupled since 1982, growing at a far faster rate than it has in larger cities.6 Approximately 60 percent of all auto trips are less than 5 miles in
