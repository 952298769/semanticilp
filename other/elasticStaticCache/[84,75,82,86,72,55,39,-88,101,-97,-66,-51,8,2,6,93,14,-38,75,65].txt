are good conductors of heat and electricity and be able to test those predictions observe, analyze, and predict properties of one-dimensional motion including position, distance, average speed, and change of speed distinguish between familiar forms of energy including heat, electrical, light, and mechanical (potential and kinetic) B. identify, describe, and categorize living things based on their characteristics identify characteristics of wave phenomena such as period, wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and phase identify key properties and applications of various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum identify characteristics and effects of fields C. measure properties and characteristics understand the goals of measurement and the usefulness of standard measurements use instruments to measure time, temperature, length, mass, weight, and volume calculate density and rates of change identify and manage sources of error and uncertainty use estimation skills to check
