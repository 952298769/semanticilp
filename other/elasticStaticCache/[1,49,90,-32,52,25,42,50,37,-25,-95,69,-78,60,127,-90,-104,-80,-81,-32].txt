across which gas exchange by diffusion can occur between blood and either water or air The surface must be moist enough to allow the cells to live large enough to permit sufficient gas exchange thin enough to permit rapid diffusion In respiration blood entering the respiratory organ must be high in CO 2 and low in O 2 both gases must move into and out of the body tissues through diffusion requires a functional connection between the respiratory and circulatory system the external air/water medium must be frequently replenished The primary respiratory organs of vertebrates are gills and lungs, although the skin is sometimes used External cutaneous respiration is the ancestral form of respiration found in most protochordates During external respiration gas exchange occurs at the level of the skin and oxygen and carbon dioxide are passed into and out of tissues the process still occurs in small vertebrates as long as they have low activity levels and live in cool flowing water or in damp air - frogs meet about \nhalf of their needs for gas exchange through their skin Because most vertebrates are too large for each cell to interact directly with the environment, many organisms have evolved specialized organ systems to undertake the process of diffusion Generally, fishes use gills and tetrapods use lungs, although the distinction is not absolute Through ventilation of the organs of the respiratory system, gaseous exchange can occur Ventilation of respiratory structures depends on ram ventilation - forward momentum contributes to flow of water across the gill membranes dual pump - buccal and opercular action operating in tandem drives water in a nearly continuous unidirectional flow across the gill curtain between them - the suction phase begins with compressed buccal and opercular cavities and closed valves - as the buccal cavity expands, the internal oral valves open and water moves into the buccal cavity and across the gill curtain - during the force phase , the oral valve closes and water is forced out through the opercular valve pulse pump - the dual pump is modified into an inhalation/exhalation phase - the exhalation phase begins with transfer of spent air from the lungs into the buccal cavity - the exhalation phase concludes with expulsion of air from the buccal cavity to the outside either through the mouth or under the operculum - the inhalation phase begins with the organism taking fresh air into the mouth - the inhalation phase concludes with transfer of air from the buccal cavity into the lungs aspiration pump - air is sucked in, or aspirated, by low pressure created around the lungs - the lungs are located within the pump so that the force required to ventilate them is applied directly - a moveable diaphragm and rib cage cause pressure changes rather than the action of the buccal cavity Internal gills develop from the pharynx as evaginations called pharyngeal pouches visceral grooves opposite to the pharyngeal pouches are separated from the pharyngeal pouches by a thin layer of tissue called the closing plate - the closing plates rupture in the embryo to establish the communication between the gill chamber and the surrounding medium - tetrapods retain the first closing plate, which becomes the eardrum (tympanic membrane), while the remaining ones disappear the pouches are also separated by the visceral arches, which combine to form the parabranchial gill chambers the first visceral arch becomes the spiracle The general structure of a mature gill is composed of several parts: gill rakers are cartilagenous or bony parts on the pharyngeal margin of the gill and function in preventing food particles from entering the gill chambers gill rays are found within the interbranchial septa and provide support for the gill gill filaments are the feather-like projections of the gills across which diffusion of gases occurs gill filaments also possess gill lamellae, which are small crevices through which water passes for diffusion - lamellae are oriented parallel to the stream of water through the gills to maximize efficiency of diffusion - the blood flow through the gills opposes the flow of water through the lamellae (countercurrent flow) and maximizes the efficiency of diffusion - this is important because water has about 1/30th the oxygen concentration of air Three primary types of gill morphology are found in fishes: Holobranch - gill bar with anterior and posterior rows of gill filaments (jawed fishes) Hemibranch - gill bar with gill filaments found on either the posterior or anterior side (sharks) Pseudobranch - gill bar with posterior filaments modified to serve a nonrespiratory function such as sensory or salt balance - spiracular pseudobranch in rays and skates with much reduced hemibranch providing unobstructed flow of water for gill irrigation Gills can also be used in excretion of nitrogenous wastes (in the form of ammonia) and regulation of salts in the body There are three general variations in gills found in fishes: Pouched gills - Agnatha - have external and internal pores rather than gill slits - water is drawn into the gill chambers through the mouth and then passed over the gills Septal gills - Elasmobranchs - have gill slits rather than pores and gill septa that help support gill filaments - inspiration occurs through the mouth and expiration occurs through the gills - the exception is when the shark is feeding, when water moves into the pharynx through the spiracle Opercular gills - bony fishes - have no septa (aseptal) but gill bars anchor gill filaments - the operculum protects the filaments and expiration occurs through a single gill slit External gills develop from the skin ectoderm of the branchial area but are not directly related to the visceral skeleton or branchial chambers are found most often in larval or paedomorphic amphibians Swim bladders and the origin of lungs Lungs are found among fishes found in warm or stagnant water, as well as in primitive fishes, and allow for the fish to gulp air and undergo diffusion in an environment with relatively low dissolved oxygen Such fishes undergo long periods of breath-holding ( apnea ) alternated with short periods of lung ventilation Swim bladders Swim bladders are similar to lungs, but are found in fishes that live in more oxygen-rich environments - thus, the air-filled spaces serve less of a purpose in respiration and function more as a hydrostatic organ are connected to the pharynx by the pneumatic duct make up approximately 4 - 11% of the body by volume counters the increased density and sinking tendency from an ossified skeleton gas is secreted into the swim bladder from blood by action of the gas glands or may be connected directly to the digestive tract via the pneumatic duct in primitive teleosts air is added to the swim bladder to maintain its volume as fish dive and removed as the fish surfaces gas glands may be associated with a countercurrent rete mirabile, which affects partial pressure and flow of oxygen into and out of the bladder Lungs and their ducts Tetrapod lungs are paired organs surrounded by pleura and contained in the pleural cavity they have a higher surface to area volume ratio than the gills are joined to the ventral side of the gut tube by the trachea \nin general, any increase in overall body size leads to an increased amount of compartmentalization of the lungs During respiration air enters through the mouth, or into the external nares to the choanae, and then passes into the pharynx from there, air travels through the glottis to the trachea, and in the trachea splits into bronchi the bronchi then lead to the lungs, which are themselves highly lobed branching continues from the bronchi into bronchioles, then alveolar sacs, and end in alveoli - small sac-like structure within the lung where gas exchange occurs As in gills, the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide is facilitated by counter-current flow in the alveoli the lining of the lungs is lubricated by surfactant, a tension depressant surfactants are generally lipoproteins and reduce the resistance to lung expansion as well as the energy needed to fill the lungs In the evolution of lungs from amphibians to mammals, several modifications to the respiratory structures are primarily associated with ventilation of the lungs In amphibians, ventilation of the lungs occurs through external nares and choanae rather than the mouth - air is drawn into the pharynx by muscle contraction that lowers the pharynx floor In reptiles, muscle action against the ribs helps to change internal air pressure, causing inspiration - the action is assisted by contraction of the diaphragmatic muscle, which is not the same thing as the diaphragm In birds, the lungs are half the size of the lungs of a similarly-sized mammal - however, the lungs connect to a system of air sacs in the bones and abdominal cavity, which increases the capacity to 2 - 3 times that of a similarly-sized mammal - the result is to decrease overall body mass, but still maintain respiratory efficiency - conducting passages continue to subdivide into parabronchi, with one-way airflow through the lungs The primary mammal modification is the formation of the diaphragm dividing the thoracic and abdominal cavity - movement of air into the lungs is facilitated by contraction of the diaphragm to change the pressure in the chest cavity.",1.322055459022522],["They work by taking oxygen from the air we breathe in and then exchanging it for carbon

+ 0.93% (argon + inert gases) + 0.03 CO2 Amount of air present decreases at high altitudes fig 46.1 At sea level, air pressure measures 760 mm of mercury fig 46.2 Equals the barometric pressure of air Equivalent to one atmosphere of pressure Each gas within the air exerts a partial pressure = 760 x % gas Nitrogen + inert gases = 760 x 79.02% = 600.6 mm Hg Oxygen = 760 x 20.95% = 159.2 mm Hg Carbon dioxide = 760 x 0.03% = 0.2 mm Hg Less air, therefore less oxygen present at high altitudes Barometric pressure above 6000 meters = 380 mm Hg Partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)= 380 x 20.95% = 80 mm Hg

into two bronchi one for each lung fig 46.12 Bronchi further branch into smaller tubes, narrowest called bronchioles Trachea and bronchi reinforced with cartilaginous rings Bronchioles have only smooth muscle in walls Smooth muscle lining adjusts size of passageway Contraction stimulated by parasympathetic division of the nervous system Decrease in diameter by half increases resistance sixteen fold Sympathetic division relaxes smooth muscle, causes bronchodilation, decreases resistance Bronchodilation also caused by epinephrine Drug used to treat symptoms of asthma triggered by release of histamine The Structure of the Lung Terminal bronchioles deliver air to respiratory bronchioles Contain alveoli where gas exchange occurs Alveoli are outpouchings surrounded by capillaries
