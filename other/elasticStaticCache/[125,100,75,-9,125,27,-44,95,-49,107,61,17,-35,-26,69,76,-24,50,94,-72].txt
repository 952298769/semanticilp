If this H-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform (such as the H near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.",1.731728434562683],["The patient lies in between two magnets and the magnetic fields which cause some of the domains in the human body to align such as the heart, brain, spine and other internal organs.",1.7311701774597168],["It is always more convenient to model the force between two magnets as being due to forces between magnetic poles having \"magnetic charges\" 'smeared' over them.",1.7297815084457397],["The speaker is able to change the force between the magnets from attractive to repulsive at will because any temperature change in the magnets affects the force between them.",1.7296580076217651],["The speaker is able to change the force between the magnets from attractive to repulsive at will because any temperature change in the magnets affects the force between them.",1.7296580076217651],["When two magnets or magnetic objects are close to each other, there is a force that attracts the poles together.",1.7289141416549683],["As a result the magnetic forces from the various domains cancel each other and two paper clips are not magnetically attracted to each other.",1.7289141416549683],["Attractive force of a magnet is maximum at a) two ends b) mid point c) entire magnet d) at one end.",1.7289141416549683],["When you align a magnetic north with a magnetic south, the two materials tend to attract each other with a force.",1.7289141416549683],["When two magnets or magnetic objects are close to each other, there is a force that attracts the poles together.",1.7289141416549683],["When two magnets or magnetic objects are close to each other, there is a force that attracts the poles together.",1.7289141416549683],["When two magnets with opposite poles are close to each other, the magnetic force attracts them to one another.",1.7289141416549683],["The force between two small magnets is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other.
