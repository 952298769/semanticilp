generation, or whatever other function is desired. Another important aspect is the energy density of the fuel itself, but do not confuse this with the energy density of an electric or magnetic field. The energy density of a fuel is the energy that can be extracted from it through appropriate processes. For example, 1 kg [0.0685 slug] of coal can produce 24 MJ [22.748 Kbtu] of energy; gasoline can produce 45 MJ/ kg [622.65 Kbtu/slug]; and hydrogen can produce 130 MJ/kg [1798.81 Kbtu/slug]. The high energy density of hydrogen seems to indicate that it would be a great fuel source because it takes less of it to produce the same amount of energy produced by more conventional sources. Keep in mind, however, that hydrogen has a very low mass density at normal temperatures, which means that it must be stored at either very high pressure, at low temperature, or in very large tanks (or any combination thereof) to be a practical fuel source. Conventionally produced hydrogen requires more energy to produce than it can release, but it is still a good method of energy transport. Another reference is the energy content of food: fats can release 37.7 MJ/kg [521.654 Kbtu/slug] of energy, while proteins and carbohydrates release 16.8 MJ/kg [232.46 Kbtu/slug]. Fuels burning in engines, as well as foods being metabolized by organisms, undergo the same chemical process of combining with oxygen to release energy. Another method by which energy can be released from certain materials is nuclear energy production. The energy density of uranium when used in a nuclear reactor is 560 000 MJ/kg [7748.71 Mbtu/slug]. This difference in the energy density occurs because the energy produced comes from different forms of potential energy. For hydrogen, fossil fuels, and food, the energy is stored in chemical bonds and released via chemical reactions. The nuclear reaction is based on the rest mass energy of subatomic particles in the uranium nucleus (or the nucleus of other fissionable material). The masses involved are small, but the c2 factor more than compensates for that. If a safe, compact, lightweight, durable, and powerful nuclear reactor were developed, then atomic hovercraft would be practical. Due to the principle of conservation of energy, all of the energy in the fuel is released (except for the parts that are not involved in the reaction due to the design of or leaks in the mechanism). Most of this energy is converted to heat, sound, and vibration, but it is not destroyed.",1.4933990240097046],["Same c.
