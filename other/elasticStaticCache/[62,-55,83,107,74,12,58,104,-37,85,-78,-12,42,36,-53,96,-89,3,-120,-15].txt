[["Organic activity activities of plants and burrowing animals can cause a rock material to disintegrate click here to see tree roots causing rocks to disintegrate B. Chemical weathering is the breakdown of a substance by decomposition resulting in the formation of new mineral matter--water and acids especially carbonic acid (H2CO3) are important agents in this type of weathering Kinds of chemical weathering hydrolysis--is the chemical reaction of water with the substance in which the (OH) in water (HOH) becomes part of the new formed substance-- often silicate minerals will weather this way to form clays solution (leaching)--is the dissolving of substances by acid in waters usually leaving residual nonsolubilized materials--carbonate minerals are especially affected by leaching oxidation--is the reaction of a substance with oxygen causing a rust to form--manganese (Mn) and especially iron (Fe) minerals are affected although there are individual chemical and physical weathering types often combinations of these can affect the total weathering of a substance III.",2.211728811264038],["Iron and Mn may also combine with organic materials in water to form chemical complexes that are difficult to remove.",1.8768788576126099],["The combining of iron filings and sulfur powder proved that when both element are heated a new property is formed, which indicated that a chemical reaction has taken place.",1.7862250804901123],["The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut.",1.7193193435668945],["When the iron and carbon are chemically combined in the form of cementite, the cast iron is very hard and is known as white cast iron.\"",1.6334428787231445]]
