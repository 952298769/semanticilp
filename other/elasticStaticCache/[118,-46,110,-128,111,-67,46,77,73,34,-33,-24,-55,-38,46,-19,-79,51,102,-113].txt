clinical records e.g., body temperature, vital signs, weight 24-hour fluid balance record medication record nursing care records focus charting uses keywords that describe what is happening to the client the focus is not limited to clinical problems the focus could denote any of the following: a current client concern a significant change in client status or behavior a significant event in client therapy typically uses three columns date/hour focus progress notes progress notes entries are organized by DAR data action response charting by exception (CBE) documentation system in which only significant findings or exception to norms are recorded three components of CBE charting unique flowsheets that highlight significant findings and define assessment parameters and findings documentation by reference to Standards of Nursing Practice which eliminates much of the repetitive charting of routine care e.g., for the two standards &quot;the nurse shall ensure that the client has a complete linen change every three days and as needed&quot; and &quot;the nurse shall ensure that the client is offered oral care tid&quot; the documentation according to these specified standards involves only a check mark in the routine standards box on the graphic record and if all the standards are not implemented, an * with reference to the nurses notes is made and all *

following criteria: be complete must be helpful to the client and health care professionals use of standard terminology use commonly accepted abbreviations, symbols, and terms that are specified by the agency brevity all recordings must meet the following criteria: be brief but be complete legal awareness clinical record is a legal document accurate, complete documentation should give legal
