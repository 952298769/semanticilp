the information in a chart or graph Plan and conduct simple investigations by using simple instruments such as magnifiers and thermometers Observe differences in types of clouds Observe weather by using the senses Renewable and Non-renewable Resources (CS 4) Students will be able to: Identify some naturally occurring materials which humans use for various purposes (water, wood, coal, metals) Demonstrate ways in which various materials can be reused or recycled (i.e. reusing containers or using scrap paper for art projects) Animals (CS 3) Students will be able to: Group students using a particular attribute or characteristic (e.g. gender, hair color, eye color, size of hand and feet) Sort a collection of animal photographs into two or more groups using one or more attributes or characteristics (e.g. size, type of fur, habitat, food preference) Visit habitats and describe the animal generally found in each habitat Observe and display understanding of the needs of animals in the classroom by caring for them responsibly Name an animal whose appearance changes in different seasons and describe the differences Discuss features that help animals survive in different environments or in the same environment during different seasons Investigate different habitats to identify some of the ways in which plants and animals which live there depend on each other (e.g. food, shelter) Explore the various needs of living things (e.g. water, food, shelter) Place common plants and animals on simple food chains Identify real or representations (pictures, drawing) of animals found near their home or school and ask questions concerning their attributes and needs for survival Compare pictures of animals or humans (themselves and family members) to identify similarities and differences Identify the major anatomical features of animals, and the major function of each Observe the development of various animals and use those observations to construct life
