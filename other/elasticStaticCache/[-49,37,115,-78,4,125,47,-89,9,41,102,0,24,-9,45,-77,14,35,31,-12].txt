realistic&#151;due to a time lag between the acquisition of resources and the production/release of eggs/offspring &#151;so, the number of offspring produced when the population reaches K may actually have been set some time before when N was still below K , etc. chaos does not imply random variations&#151;simply that fluctuations are unpredictable: most often seen in species with large reproductive potential ( r large) and strong density-dependent changes in mortality and fecundity in part due to non-linearities in effects of environment on survivorship and fecundity &#151; slight differences in initial conditions can produce large differences in final population sizes (like the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; in weather forcasting) C. Key Factor Analysis we often wish to know the specific cause(s) of observed fluctuations in the size/density of populations in the field &#151; this can point to ways of controlling pests or increasing the numbers of endangered species, for example one method that has been applied here is key factor analysis &#151; first applied to study of univoltine (&quot;annual&quot;) insects (spruce budworm) by Morris (1957) construct a life table for each year &#151; use stages (adult, egg, larva, pupa, adult) instead of age classes: calculate k values for each life stage transition &#151; k = instantaneous mortality coefficient: k = log(N s ) - log(N e ) where k = instantaneous mortality coefficient N s = number of individuals starting the stage N e = number of individuals ending the stage for example, 83.0 individuals (per m 2 ) entered the pupal stage in 1955 &#151; 54.6 were killed by pupal predators (shrews, mice and beetles) during late summer, leaving only 28.4 per m 2 : k 5 = log(83.0) - log(28.4) = 0.47 we can then plot overall mortality along with all of the &quot;component&quot; mortalities, and look for those that are most responsible for the observed pattern &#151; i.e., look for the key factors in this case, winter disappearance is the key factor causing the major fluctuations in population size we can also plot the k values for different years against the population density at each time to look for density-dependence in the various mortalities: here winter disappearance is density-independent, but pupal predation (increases with density) and mortality due to other parasites (decreases with density) are both density-dependent D. Experimental Manipulations besides key factor analysis, another method of determining which factor(s) determine or limit population size is to experimentally manipulate suspected factors and observe the effects on \npopulation size: e.g., you can experimentally reduce or increase the numbers of predators, competitors, parasites, food organisms, etc. provides stronger evidence than simple correlations between environmental factors and population size in unmanipulated populations some factors are hard to regulate (e.g., weather), but you can still make predictions about the outcome of a cold spring on deer population size, for example Last Updated: Wednesday, November 18, 2000 Contact: Dr. David J.

Population Dynamics of Predation we can look at effects of predation on the population dynamics (i.e., changes in density over time) of both the predator and its prey we will begin by considering a relatively simple model based on differential equations considering just one predator and one prey species: Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model here we have two basic components : C = number (or density) of the consumer (= predator) population N = number (or density or biomass) of the prey or plant population here we have two simultaneous differential equations , one for the prey and one for the predator 1) PREY POPULATION GROWTH RATE: prey population growth rate = exponential birth rate - predator-caused death rate assumption #1 : in the absence of predators, the prey population increases exponentially, i.e., no density-dependence: dN/dt = r N but prey individuals are removed (i.e., killed) by predators: the rate of removal depends on the rate of predator-prey encounters and the efficiency of the predator encounters increase as: 1) the number of predators (C) increase 2) the number of prey (N) increases the predator&#146;s efficiency can be designated a', the &quot;attack rate&quot; of the predator&#151;a' increases with: 1) increasing search efficiency 2) increasing capture efficiency assumption #2 : a' comes from linear functional response: the rate of successful encounters (i.e., the consumption rate) will then be: a'CN and the overall equation for the prey population dynamics becomes: dN/dt = r N - a'CN (a) 2) PREDATOR POPULATION GROWTH RATE: predator population growth rate = birth rate - background mortality rate in the absence of food (prey), individual predators lose weight and starve to death therefore, in this model, predators are assumed to suffer a &quot;background&quot; mortality&#151;decline exponentially through starvation in absence of prey: dC/dt = -qC where: q = mortality rate this lose of predators is counteracted by predator birth, which depends on: 1) the rate at which food (prey) is consumed: a'CN 2) the predator's efficiency (f) of turning this food into predator offspring there are two additional assumptions here: assumption",1.3317053318023682],["Further, as populations of Galerucella increase, there will be a decrease in the number of flowers and seeds produced.",1.3308662176132202],["During this time, increasing production costs have caused producers to significantly increase prices, which may have contributed to a decrease in the amounts consumed.",1.3261995315551758],["prey numbers would increase because predators are thinning out the population predation will act as a selective force on prey, with those best capable of avoiding predation surviving predation will act as a selective force on predator because they become highly specialized predator numbers will decrease because they ate all the prey 19.",1.3251913785934448],["Thus, glucocorticoids may cause both decreased formation of new cells and increased cell death in the populations that are most important for the formation of new bone.",1.3249362707138062],["Increased exploration of caves and mines has probably caused a decrease in population numbers.",1.3247267007827759],["An increase or decrease in an animal population may indicate damage to the ecosystem caused by pollution.",1.3247267007827759],["Researchers spent 18 years studying all the causes of population increase and decrease.",1.3247267007827759],["Such a rapid increase in the population might cause a long term decrease in the carrying capacity.",1.3247267007827759],["Decreases in reproductivity in dense rodent populations are caused by increased rates of spontaneous _____.",1.3247267007827759]]
