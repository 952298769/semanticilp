[["The Formation of Sediment: Weathering - weathering and erosion counteract processes which uplift and reconstitute continental crust (mountain building and volcanism at convergent plate margins) - weathering reduces the grain size, and dissolves crustal materials allowing them, through erosion, to be transported by wind and water to the ocean basins I. Erosion - this is a process whereby rock and soil materials are moved under the influence of gravity through mechanisms such as mud slides, flow of glacial ice, flow of water in rivers, wind - erosion by water, followed by deposition of eroded materials, forms the majority of the sedimentary rocks that we observe on the earth's surface - without erosion, the products of weathering would not be transported and sedimentary deposits would not exist II.",1.8750540018081665],["Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth 's surface and within bodies of water.

rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water

systems for moving sediment—rock debris such as clay, silt, sand, gravel, or even larger material—across Earth's surface to the world's oceans and seas. Naturally and routinely, the flow of water in a stream may become too high to be accommodated in the stream's channel. The water then flows over the stream's banks and floods the surrounding land. As it does so, the water immediately slows down and drops any sediment it was carrying. Coarser sediment is deposited near the channel. Over time, as the process is repeated over and over, the sediment forms mounds called natural levees along the stream's banks. Finer sediment (sands, silt, and clay) carried by the water is spread farther away from the channel before it is finally deposited. The flat or gently sloping surface created by the repeated deposition of sediment along a stream is called the stream's floodplain. A floodplain may cover all or just a portion of the valley floor.

the most characteristic feature responsible for layering of sedimentary rocks - Strata or beds or layers distinguished by color, texture or mineral composition - bedding planes represent a break in deposition or change in the type or source of sediments 20 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures Cross Stratification or Cross-bedding - beds are inclined at an angle with respect to the upper and lower surfaces - forms mostly in sand size sediments (deposited on steep local slopes) - indicates transport and deposition by a flowing medium mainly wind and water waves and often used to infer the direction of sediment transport 21 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures Ripples -
