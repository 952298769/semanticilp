depends on the masses of their molecules heavy molecules in a mixture move slower on average than light ones gases made of light molecules diffuse through pores in membranes faster than heavy molecules differences from dialysis membrane is permeable, not semipermeable: all gas molecules in the mixture can pass through it size of molecules isn't usually important: pores in membrane are much
