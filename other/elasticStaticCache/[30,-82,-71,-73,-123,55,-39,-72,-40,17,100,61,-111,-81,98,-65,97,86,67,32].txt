the surface expression of the lithosphere and owe their development to processes originating from both within and outside the earth s surface Two types of processes that are shaping Earth s surface:

erosion by running water, wind, waves): SEQUENTIAL LANDFORMS \nExample: Some plains are formed by erosion over long periods of time (streams or glaciers) while others are formed by accumulation of
