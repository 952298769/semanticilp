[["geological shifts such as meteor impacts, the advance or retreat of glaciers, or a series of volcanic eruptions) Science Standard 1, Grades 6-8 Knows the properties that make water an essential component of Earth system (e.g., its ability to act as a solvent, its ability to remain a liquid at most Earth temperatures) Science Standard 1, Grades 9-12 Knows how life is adapted to conditions on Earth (e.g., force of gravity that enables the planet to retain an adequate atmosphere, intensity of radiation from the Sun that allows water to cycle between liquid and vapor) Science Standard 10, Grades 3-5 Knows that properties such as length, weight, temperature, and volume can be measured using appropriate tools (e.g., rulers, balances, thermometers, graduated cylinders) Science Standard 10, Grades 3-5 Knows that materials have different states (solid, liquid, gas), and some common materials such as \nwater can be changed from one state to another by heating or cooling Science Standard 15, Grades K-2 Knows that tools (e.g., thermometers, magnifiers, rulers, balances) can be used to gather information and extend the senses Science Standard 15, Grades 3-5 Plans and conducts simple investigations (e.g., makes systematic observations, conducts simple experiments to answer questions) Science Standard 15, Grades 3-5 Uses simple equipment and tools to gather scientific data and extend the senses (e.g., rulers, thermometers, magnifiers, microscopes, calculators) Science Standard 15, Grades 6-8 Designs and conducts a scientific investigation (e.g., formulates questions, designs and executes investigations, interprets data, synthesizes evidence into explanations, proposes alternative explanations for observations, critiques explanations and procedures) Science Standard 15, Grades 6-8 Uses appropriate tools (including computer hardware and software) and techniques to gather, analyze, and interpret scientific data Science Standard 15, Grades 6-8 Establishes relationships based on evidence and logical argument (e.g., provides causes for effects) Science Standard 15, Grades 9-12 Understands the use of hypotheses in science (e.g., selecting and narrowing the focus of data, determining additional data to be gathered;",0.7416027784347534]]
