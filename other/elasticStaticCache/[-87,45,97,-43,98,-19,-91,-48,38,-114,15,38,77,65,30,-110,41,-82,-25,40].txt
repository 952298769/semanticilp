While you could go to the local bait shop for your worms, you could be be buying yourself a heap of problems. Worms found in the baitshop may not be the correct species or may be infected with various types of fungi, bacteria, or mites. While this is not a problem if you plan to feed them to your local fish population, it is an issue if you plan to keep them in your home. Also, a number of the worms sold in your bait shop are larval forms of beetles and will not be worms for long... The species you need are either Eisenia foetida (Red Wiggler) or Lumbricus rubellus (Red Worms). These species are commonly found in organic rich soils throughout Europe and north America and especially prefer the special conditions in rotting vegetation, compost and manure piles. Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil, where space is limited. Vermicomposting bins (also known as worm bins) vary drastically depending on the desired size of the system. Garden-scale containers can be made out of bricks arranged in the shape of a box. Bins for an apartment or similar dwelling can be anything from reused plastic buckets to purpose-built commercial containers. Small-scale systems may use a wide variety of bins. Often, small-scale composters build their own bins. Companies also sell such bins. Commonly, bins are made of old plastic containers, wood, Styrofoam containers, or metal containers. Some materials are less desirable than others in bin construction. Styrofoam is believed to release toxins into the earthworms' environment. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release heavy metals into compost. Bins should have holes in the sides to allow air to flow, and a spout that can be opened or closed or holes in the bottom to drain into a collection tray. Plastic bins require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms. Most small bins can be grouped into three categories: Non-continuous – an undivided container. A layer of bedding materials is placed in the bin, lining the bottom. Worms are added and organic matter for composting is added in a layer above the bedding. Another layer is added on top of the organic matter and the worms will start to compost the organic matter and bedding. This type of bin is often used because it is small and easy to build. But it is relatively difficult to harvest because all the materials and worms must be emptied out when harvesting. Continuous vertical flow – a series of trays stacked vertically. The bottom-most tray is filled first, in a similar fashion to any other bin, but is not harvested when it is full. Instead, a thick layer of bedding is added on top and the tray above is used for adding organic material. Worms finish composting the materials in the bottom tray and then migrate to the one above. When a sufficient number of worms have migrated, the vermicompost in the bottom tray can be collected and should be relatively free of worms. These bins provide an easier method of harvesting. Continuous horizontal flow – a series of trays lined horizontally. This method too relies on the earthworms migrating towards a food source in order to ease the process of harvesting. The bin is usually constructed to be similar to a non-continuous bin but longer horizontally. It is divided in half, usually by a large gauge screen of chicken wire. One half is used until it becomes full, then the other half is filled with bedding and organic matter. In time, the worms migrate to the side with the food and the compost can be collected. These bins are larger than a non-continuous system but still small enough to be convenient. If done correctly, your vermiculture will not stink or have any problems. In fact, I have a friend that has it right in her kitchen. Her husband does woodworking and fashioned a bench for their vertical flow one that also works as a bench to sit on. She gets such a laugh out of telling visitors that they are sitting on a box of worms!

Ask each student group or pair to place 1 cup of dry soil into a 2-cup container.2. Students should slowly pour 1 cup of water into the soil container until the soil is “saturated” or all the dry soil is “mud.” While they were pouring the water they should notice the “air bubbles” that are rising to the surface.3. Students should measure the amount of water left and subtract it from 1 cup.4. Lead students to infer that the amount of water in the soil sample was approximately the amount of air that was displaced. As the students added the water to the sample, they should have seen bubbles, until the sample was saturated.5. Have students compare the amount of water that they were able to pour into their soil samples. There will be differences depending on the soil texture and organic matter. What is the percentage of air in the soil sample? If they were able to add a 1/4 cup of water, the sample contained 25 percent air.6. Using the components of the soil transparency, and the movable yarn, explain how air and water amounts change.Discussion1. What are the components of soil? (mineral matter, organic matter, water, air)2. Which two components are the most variable? (water and air) Why?3. Why do worms come up to the surface after a drenching rain? (to breathe)Background Soil is naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose material at the surface of the earth,which is capable of supporting plant and animal life. In simple terms, soil is comprised ofthree components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase which accounts for approxi-mately 50 percent of the volume in a typical soil is a mixture of mineral and organic matterand gives soil its mass. Soil particles fit loosely (depending on the particle size) leaving“empty” pore spaces. The pore spaces are then filled with water (liquid) and air (gas). Thewater and air in an “average” soil make up the other half of the soil’s volume. All soils are made up of the four major components; however the portions will vary. Themineral matter is derived from the weathering of hard rock at the earth’s surface. An“average” soil is made up of approximately 45 percent mineral content by volume, theamount and size of mineral particles vary. In an “average” soil, the amount of organic matter (living and dead organisms) willrange between 1 and 5 percent. Organic matter is mostly composed of dead plant andanimal remains. This decay in the upper layer of soil, or topsoil, is the major source ofplant nutrients and other organisms. Organic matter is what makes a soil fertile. Soils highin organic matter do not compress as tightly allowing for more air spaces. Organic par-ticles also hold the moisture by absorbing water.
