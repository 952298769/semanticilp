Because it is an elastic system, this kind of potential energy is specifically called elastic potential energy. Elastic potential energy (measured in the unit joules) is equal to Â½ multiplied by the stretch length (\"x\") squared, multiplied by the spring constant \"k.\" The spring constant is different for every rubber band, but can be figured out (see \"Welcome to the Guide to Shooting Rubber Bands\" below). When the rubber band is released, the potential energy is quickly converted to kinetic (motion) energy. This is equal to one half the mass (of the rubber band) multiplied by its velocity (in meters per second) squared.",1.5694830417633057],["The chemical properties stay the same but the atom mass differs.",1.4513483047485352],["The chemical properties stay the same but the atom mass differs.",1.4513483047485352],["You might experiment further with the device by placing masses of various sizes in contact with the stretched rubber band.",1.444238305091858],["C4-51 WEIGHTLESSNESS IN FREE FALL - MASS IN BEAKER A 100g mass is attached to the inside of an inverted plastic beaker by a rubber band, which pulls mass into beaker when system is dropped.",1.3951892852783203],["The Mass and Center of Mass of a Rubber Sheet A rubber sheet is stretched across a circular ringof radius and a weight is placed in the middle which pulls it downward.",1.38377046585083],["A mass sits between the rubber bands.",1.3800467252731323],["When materials change from one state to another, although the properties change, the mass stays the same.",1.3586280345916748]]
