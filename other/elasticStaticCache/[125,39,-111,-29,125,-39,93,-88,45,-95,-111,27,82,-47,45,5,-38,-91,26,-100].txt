which have mass Wave an oscillating pattern moving through space Wavelength the length of one wave Weak Force Weak Nuclear Force - one of the four fundimental force s in the universe White Dwarf a dim star which is hot ( temperature about 15,000 K) and very small (the size of Earth ) the inert carbon -rich core of a star left after if evolves into a Planetary Nebula White Dwarf Region the lower left corner of the HR diagram where hot, tiny stars are found Wien's Law a relationship between the wavelength of peak intensity and temperature valid for perfect thermal radiators X-rays a high energy portion of the EM spectrum - higher energy than ultraviolet and lower than gamma ray Young Stars usually referring to stars which were born less than one billion years ago Zenith the point
