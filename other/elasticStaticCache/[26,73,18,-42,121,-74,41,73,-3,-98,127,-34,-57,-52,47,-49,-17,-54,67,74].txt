Organisms that are unable to detoxify atmospheric oxygen are termed obligate anaerobes because they cannot grow (nor, often, even survive) in the presence of oxygen (b) Obviously, obligate anaerobes

organisms tend to exist in environments in which oxygen concentrations are uncertain, and serve as the oxygen scavengers in environments displaying relatively low oxygen concentrations (c) For example, the lumen of the \nlarge intestine is mostly anaerobic because (i) the body does not actively oxygenate the lumen of the large intestine and (ii) oxygen scavengers such as Escherichia coli

aerotolerant anaerobe ( Google Search )] [ index ] (42) Strict anaerobe (a) A strict anaerobe is unable to replicate, and may even die given the presence of oxygen (b) This inability or fragility

growth and survival of cells (b) [ osmosis ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (45) Plasmolysis (a) Environments containing large concentrations of dissolved substances draw water out of cells, causing a shrinkage of the cytoplasm volume, a phenomenon termed plasmolysis (b) Plasmolysis interferes with growth and this is why highly osmotic environments prevent bacterial growth (e.g., brine, the high sugar concentrations in jellies and jams, salting of meats) (c) [ plasmolysis and bacteria ( Google Search )] [ index ] (46) Halophiles (a) Organisms that require high concentrations of dissolved

elements (b) In addition, some microorganisms require various vitamins as well as additional organic factors (e.g., specific amino acids) (c) &quot;Although we are concerned with ways microorganisms
