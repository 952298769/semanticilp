Nutrient acquisition is assumed to be governed primarily by nutrient availability in the soil. Similar to soil moisture, nutrient distribution is also uneven in the soil in natural environments. Roots must respond to the heterogenous distribution of nutrients in order to supply sufficient nutrients to the shoot. Nutrient uptake rate per unit root mass or length is often higher for roots in nutrient-rich patches than those in uniformly rich or uniformly poor soil or solution. Higher specific rates of uptake may be a function of both higher nutrient concentrations in the patch and higher uptake capacity of the roots in the patch.
