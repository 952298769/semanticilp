DRAFT April 10, 2014 96 Plants and animals have the same needs as humans. All living things need food, water and air. Plants need “food”, the minerals and nutrients from the soil, energy from the sun and water. They also need the carbon dioxide from plants. Humans and animals need enough nutritious food, clean water to drink, comfortable and safe home, and unpolluted air to breathe. Note: 1. Breathing in plants can be explained as the exchange of gases. The plants give off oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide from animals and humans. Eating in plants can be explained as the absorption of minerals and nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun. Drinking in plants can be explained as the absorption of water from the soil and movement as the reaction of the plants to gravity, sunlight and wind. 2. a. Activities common to humans, animals and plants include breathing, eating, drinking, movement and living in a habitat. b. Humans, animals and plants breathe the same air. The air they breathe is from the environment. c. Humans, animals and plants do not eat the same food but they get the food from one source, the environment. d. Humans, animals and plants drink the same water but not from the same source. The water they drink is from the environment. e. Humans, animals and plants do not live in the same habitat. All of these habitats are found in the environment. Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. identify the basic needs of humans, animals and plants; and 2. compare the similarities and differences in the basic needs of humans, animals and plants. Materials picture of the basic needs of human. Animals and plants Procedure A. Review The teacher can relate the lesson on heredity to the lesson on ecosystem. Sample questions the teacher can ask the students: a. What characteristics do children get from their parents? b. Can human parents produce children that are not humans? c. Can animals produce children that are humans? d. Can plants produce animals or humans? B. Motivation / Presentation",1.393484115600586],["22. to drink water, as an animal.",1.3865470886230469],["4.
