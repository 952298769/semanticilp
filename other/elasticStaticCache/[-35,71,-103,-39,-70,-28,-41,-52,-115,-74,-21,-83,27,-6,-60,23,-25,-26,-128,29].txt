Amphibians are vertebrates, so they have a bony skeleton. Most amphibians live part of their lives underwater and part on land. Amphibians reproduce by laying eggs that do not have a soft skin, not a hard shell. Most females lay eggs in the water and the babies, called larvae or tadpoles, live in the water, using gills to breathe and finding food as fish do. As the tadpoles grow, they develop legs and lungs that allow them to live on land. This big change is called \"metamorphosis.\" Even after they change, amphibians still have soft moist skin, and nearly all of them have to live in damp places, so they don't dry out.",1.7392973899841309],["Why should we be concerned about frogs, they are lowly creatures after all?  As they are major predators of insects they fulfil an important role in the food chains and without them insects can multiply out of control causing considerable damage to crops and a dramatic increase in insect borne diseases such as encephalitis and malaria.  As we have seen most frogs have a biphasic life cycle, where eggs laid in water, develop into tadpoles and these live in the water until they metamorphose into tiny replicas of the adults.  This fact, coupled with being covered by a semi-permeable skin, makes frogs particularly vulnerable to pollutants and other environmental stresses. Consequently frogs can be used as environmental sentinels or biomonitors and act as an early warning system for the quality of the environment and the potential threats to other animals including ourselves. In addition frogs throughout the world provide a valuable source of food for humans and other animals.",1.7304402589797974],["Frogs typically lay their eggs in water.

For example, gastric brooding frogs, which are now extinct, swallowed their eggs. They stopped eating and digesting food while their young developed in their stomachs instead of in water. The baby frogs then exited through their parent's mouth. Strawberry poison dart frogs, which live in Central America and Puerto Rico, lay their eggs on land, and males keep them moist with urine. Once the eggs hatch, the mother carries each tadpole on her back to its own tiny pool of water that has collected between the stem and leaves of a plant. While the tadpoles grow, their mother feeds them her own eggs.",1.6509922742843628],["Bullfrogs will become sexually active after 2–4 years of becoming a frog.
