organisms interacts Endangered: a species that is at risk of becoming extinct in the foreseeable future Endangered Species Act (ESA): legislation, passed by Congress in 1973, which protects listed species (those considered threatened or endangered) Extinction: the act of becoming extinct, a species is extinct when no living members exist Exotic Species: a species introduced intentionally or accidentally into a new environment (in habitats where it is normally not found) through human activities Fauna: refers to the animal life of a particular region, geological period or environment Flora: refers to the plant life of a particular region, geological period or environment Habitat: the environment in which a plant or animal lives Herbivorous: plant-eating Native Species: a species that belongs to an area, they have been part of a given biological landscape for a long period time Overexploitation: the killing of a species well beyond the point that the population levels can be sustained Population: a group of organisms, of one species, that occupy a defined area and are usually isolated from similar groups of the same species Predator: an animal that preys on others Prey: an animal that is preyed upon by a predator Pollution: the contamination of air, water, or soil because of the discharge of harmful substances, usually resulting from human activities Species: a group of individuals that has similar characteristics and breeds only with another member of the same group Threatened: a species that is at risk of becoming endangered in the foreseeable future U.S. Fish

frustrated or angry Theoretical Perspectives on Aggression Excitation Transfer Theory Zillmann (1988) Based on the assumption that physiological arousal dissipates slowly over time The combination of pre-existing arousal, plus anger generated in a new situation, may increase the likelihood of aggression Transfer of arousal from one situation to another is most likely to occur if the person is unaware that he or she is still carrying some arousal from a previous situation to a new unrelated one Theoretical Perspectives on Aggression Social Learning We learn to behave aggressively Conditions most conducive to learning aggression are those in which the child has many opportunities to observe aggression, is reinforced for his aggression, or is often the object of aggression (Huesmann, 1988) If behaviour is reinforced or rewarded by praise and encouragement from significant models, the probability that the behaviour will occur in the future is increased Aggressive behaviour is modeled in the home, by society, by peers, in the media/TV/movies Cognitive Models of Aggression Cognitive scripts Rowell Huesmann (1988) Behaviour is controlled through cognitive scripts that we have learned and memorized Scripts list what should happen, how the person should respond, what the outcome is likely to be Each script is different and unique to each person Scripts are resistant to change The individual evaluation of the appropriateness of a script helps to determine which scripts are stored and used Evaluation includes confidence that the person has in predicting the outcomes of the script, the extent that the person thinks he can execute the script, and extent that script is congruent with the person s internal standards Hostile Attributional Model Kenneth Dodge (1986) Interpret ambiguous events as acts of aggression Found in violent youths and adult prisoners Social environment is perceived as hostile and threatening (Blackman) Cognitive Models of Aggression Simplistic scripts and hostile attributions can lead to violence Therefore lower IQ is related to aggressive style since person doesn t have the cognitive ability to engage in problem solving This can also be a vicious circle Zillmann (1988) points out that level of arousal is also important Recognize danger => Cognitions => Arousal response In high arousal state, person is less likely to control self cognitively resulting in impulsive response (consistent with script) Environmental Factors Population Density In areas of high population concentration, personal space is constantly violated This leads to aggression and violence Supported in animal studies but not as clear with humans No evidence linking overcrowding and crime but some evidence linking overcrowding and aggression As population density and temperature increased, so did subjects negative feelings toward one another (Griffith &amp; Veitch, 1971) Population Density Gender Differences: Males in same-gender overcrowded groups were more aggressive and hostile than males in same gender un-crowded groups Reverse is true for females Males are uncomfortable and hostile in crowded, same-gender conditions, while women tend to become more affable and friendly Relationship between overcrowding and aggression not clearly supported Environmental Factors Aggression and Ambient Temperature Heat-of-the-Night phenomenon as temperature increases so does violence Extremely low and extremely high temperatures tend to inhibit aggression (Baron) Intermediate levels tend to be associated with aggression Suggests that a curvilinear or inverted U-shaped relationship occurs between temperature and aggression Others (Anderson &amp; Anderson, 1984) have found a linear relationship between temperature and aggression higher the temperature the more violent crime Others have found that a combination of high temperature and air pollution is highly related to family disturbance and violence (Rotton &amp; Frey, 1985) Effects of Mass Media Average American child sees more than 100, 000 violent episodes and some 20, 000 murders on TV before reaching adolescence (Meyers, 1996) Most studies show that television violence in particular has a significant effect on the frequency and type of aggressive behaviour expressed by some adults and children Particularly strong for young boys who closely identify with the violent characters they see on TV and for children who have difficulty in peer relationships Exposure doesn t automatically mean a person will be violent Children from low-income families are more effected (but confounds) Positive parental models are likely to override violent models on TV TV has less effect when parents don t model aggressive problem solving People who rely on aggression for meeting their needs are more influenced by media violence Extremely aggressive people choose to watch violent shows Viewing violence may lead to: habituation to violence content Distorted view of the world Heavy viewers have less physiological arousal to violence Violence in the media does appear to increase aggressive tendencies in both children and adults Victim-Precipitated Aggression People tend to respond to aggression with aggression They respond with the same level or intensity of aggression as they receive The first person then increases the level or intensity of aggression \nThis leads to escalation The Physiology of Aggression Why do males tend to be more aggressive than females?",0.7484214305877686],["Chemical and noise pollution may also threaten this
