to look around When predator spots the prey he/she points and calls out their name The prey is then out and must come and sit down next to the predator without talking After five minutes, if the predator has not found all the prey the blindfold is put back on the predator and the prey has to move 10 steps closer The blindfold is taken off again if at this time the predator cannot find the
