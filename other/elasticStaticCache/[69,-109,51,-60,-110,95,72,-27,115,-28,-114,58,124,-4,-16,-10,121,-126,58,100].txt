[["Scientific Investigation, Reasoning, and Logic Students: plan, conduct, and participate in science investigations use the scientific method and experimental design to state a hypothesis that identifies the independent (manipulated or changed) and dependent (responding or measured) variables conduct experiments with one variable being manipulated and many repeated trials collect, record, analyze, and report data using appropriate metric measurement use graphical representation (graphs, charts, and diagrams) to organize and communicate data use models to explain a sequence or estimate distance, volume, and quantity generate science questions and seek information through a variety of sources perform multiple tests before accepting or rejecting results analyze scientific explanations base conclusions on scientific evidence obtained from a variety of sources Earth and Space Science Students: investigate and understand public policy decisions related to the environment explain how renewable resources are managed (water, air, plant life, animal life) explain how nonrenewable resources are managed (coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power) discuss and determine cost and benefit tradeoffs in conservation policies Students: understand the elements of weather by recording data and making weather predictions use weather software and the Internet to collect real-time weather data construct and use weather instruments to collect weather data identify and describe components of weather including precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind, fronts, and air pressure identify weather instruments such as rain gauge, thermometer, psychrometer, anemometer, wind gauge, and barometer identify cloud types and describe general weather conditions related to the formation of major cloud types--cirrus, cumulus, and stratus use knowledge of the water cycle including evaporation, condensation, transpiration, and precipitation to predict atmospheric conditions use the pH scale to determine the acidity or alkalinity of rainwater collect and record weather data and make weather predictions use common weather symbols to create forecasting charts Life Science Students: observe the life cycle (metamorphosis) of mealworms and identify the characteristics of each stage use the scientific method to form and test hypotheses on the behavior of mealworms&#9; investigate the environmental conditions that affect the behavior of mealworms Physical Science Students: investigate and understand the properties of liquids including cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, density, and viscosity apply knowledge about solids and liquids to investigate an unknown substance demonstrate an understanding of the properties of adhesion, cohesion, and surface tension by experimenting with various common liquids demonstrate an understanding of the concept of density by layering different liquids apply knowledge of \nthe properties of liquids to develop a plan for cleaning up an oil spill Students: investigate and understand the basic concepts of electricity and magnetism including circuits, electromagnets, and electric motors construct and identify complete, incomplete, series, and parallel circuits read and draw schematic circuit diagrams using common electrical symbols demonstrate how length, diameter, and composition of a wire affect the flow of electricity in a circuit explain the relationship between magnetism and electricity and construct an electromagnet identify components and construct an electric device that simulates an electric motor Students: investigate and understand how to classify materials as elements, common compounds, or mixtures demonstrate how a mixture can be separated by physical means describe how compounds can be separated only by chemical means, and understand that elements cannot be separated by physical or chemical means Students: investigate and understand that all matter is made up of atoms understand that atoms are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons understand that atoms of an element are alike but are different from atoms of other elements describe historical developments and the significance of discoveries related to the atom Students: investigate and understand that matter has physical and chemical properties and can undergo change describe physical changes of matter (shape, volume, color, and mass) GRADE 6 SOCIAL STUDIES Social studies instruction incorporates the four strands of history, geography, civics, and economics.",1.2075557708740234]]
