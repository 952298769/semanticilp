Plates enclosed within living tissue when first formed Bear spines as indicated by phylum`s name Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple but complete: mouth, gut and anus Capable of extensive regeneration Some animals may drop parts when attacked May reproduce asexually by splitting into parts Sexual reproduction and fertilization is external Sexes are separate, but difficult to distinguish externally Develop into free-swimming, bilaterally symmetrical larvae fig 41.35

mollusks fig 41.37 Sexes separate, external fertilization Females may brood young Class Ophiuroidea: the brittle stars fig 41.33d Slender arms more sharply set off from central disk than sea stars Move by active movement of their arms along the substrate Capture suspended particles with tube feet, long spines or arms Arms detach readily, helping protect animals from predators Class Echinoidea: the sea urchins and sand dollars fig 41.33e,f Lack distinct arms, but retain familiar five-part body plan Five rows of tube feet protrude through plates of the skeleton Skeletons are made up of fused calcareous plates Walk along substrate with tube feet or movement of spines Feed on algae, debris scraped off the surfaces by triangular teeth Reproduction similar to other echinoderms Larvae have long arms, unlike those of other classes Class Holothuroidea: the sea cucumbers fig 41.33b Soft, sluglike organisms with tough, leathery outer skin Most lie on sides at the bottom of the ocean Mouth is located on one end Surrounded by tube feet modified into tentacles Tentacles secrete mucus to trap food particles Calcareous skeleton reduced to widely separated, microscopic plates Have highly branched respiratory trees that originate from cloaca Water brought into and out of cloaca by muscular contractions Gas exchange occurs across the respiratory trees Have tube feet on body, may be restricted to five grooves Move by tube feet or wriggling of the entire body Some forms are hermaphroditic, unusual for echinoderms [Return to Chapter 41 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return

where it attaches to the crown Larger Sod and Burrowing Webworms feed on most grass species Bluegrass Webworm feeds on Kentucky bluegrass and bentgrass Results in scattered, irregular brownish areas due to the thatch showing Naturally controlled by microsporidia diseases in damp, cool conditions Large numbers of larvae attract starlings, cowbirds, blackbirds, and other birds Pupate in their tunnels Burrowing webworm spins a thick, white, silk lining for the burrow when ready to pupate which is pulled out by feeding birds Two to three generations per year - larvae overwinter Adults Tan moths that hold their wings tightly against the body making them tube-like Up to 1&quot; long When disturbed, they fly in jerky up-and-down method just a few feet above the turf They fly about 30 feet or less before landing back on the turf Eggs are laid while in flight and hatch in one to two weeks Treatment is warranted two weeks after heavy moth flight if conditions stay dry Black Cutworm Larvae Grayish to black fat caterpillars up to 2&quot; Hide in the thatch during the day Emerge to feed on \ngrass blades and stems at night Damage on golf greens usually appears as circular brown areas where blades and stems have been removed Damage is common near the edge of the green due to larvae living in the thatch off of the green, but coming onto the green at night to feed Due to higher mowing height, feeding on grasses other than on greens, tees, and some fairways is usually not noticeable or important Several generations occur each year from early spring to late fall Adults Adult moths are about 1&quot; long with brownish front wings and grayish hind wings Their wings form a triangular shape when at rest When disturbed, the moths fly high and far before landing They commonly sit on turf during the day This insect does not overwinter in Illinois It flies up from the Gulf states every spring Armyworm Larvae Brownish to blackish caterpillars with orange stripes up to 1

Adults are olive-black with 8 reddish-orange legs Immatures are reddish-orange and turn darker as they grow Eggs hatch in October Adults present in November Numbers decrease by April and oversummering eggs are laid on turf Occur primarily in northern states Damage Occurs mainly in northwestern portion of the U.S. - Colorado to Oregon Turf turns brown - similar in appearance to winter desiccation or winter-kill NUISANCE PESTS Ants Family Formicidae Identification Many species - ranging from 1/16 to 1/2&quot; long as wingless workers Easily discernable head, thorax, and abdomen waist between thorax and abdomen is pinched-in looks like an hourglass elbowed antennae, may have a posterior stinger Workers are wingless, sterile females Larger, winged individuals are reproductive males and females Leave the nest in large numbers to try to start new colonies Live in colonies with division of labor between workers and reproductives Workers perform various jobs for the colony depending on their age Damage Construct underground nests usually with a mound of loose soil at the entrance Mounds of soil can be several inches high Mounds can overwhelm lawn mowers causing them to stop Mounds on greens can dull greens mower blades Generally beneficial Ants feed on dead and live insects - \nparticularly caterpillars Their tunneling loosens the soil Can cause dieback due to drying roots Increase water movement Provide channels in the soil for root growth Red Imported Fire Ant Gulf coast states from Texas to North Carolina Builds large mounds and eliminate plants on the mounds Mass and sting intruders Sting is painful and causes swelling Aggressive feeder on turf pests Difficult to control ants Hard to get insecticide deep into ant colony to get control New colonies are continually being started Cicada Killer Sphecius speciosus speciosus Identification Yellow and black wasps about 1 1/2&quot; long with reddish transparent wings Attack, sting, and drag cicadas and large katydids into their burrows Lay an egg on the prey Resulting larva eats the insect Emerges as an adult the following year Damage Dig burrows with exit holes 1/4 - 1/2&quot; diameter in sandy and other soil Burrow opening is surrounded with a small amount of fine soil Large wasps are intimidating but unlikely to sting Males patrol aerial territories and confront anything entering the territory More intimidating than the females Unable to sting Commonly a problem on golf courses due to the fear instilled in golfers Ground-Nesting Bees and Wasps Identification Ground bees are various species Tend to be 1/4-1/2&quot; long with gray and black banding Each nest contains only a few bees Usually there are many nests in a small area Unlikely to sting Eastern Yellowjacket is 1/2&quot; long with black and yellow banding Commonly referred to mistakenly as a bee Nest in abandoned rodent burrows Nest builds to several thousand individuals by fall Very likely to sting if disturbed May sting without provocation Nests are started in the spring by overwintering, mated females Nests die out in the fall with young mated females overwintering Nests are not reoccupied although new nests may be built next to old nests Damage Large numbers of bees or wasps are intimidating to people using the turf Yellowjackets are ferocious stingers Stings can be fatal to susceptible people Earthworms Identification Elongate, brownish to reddish, without legs Tunnel through the soil - may come out onto the surface at night The nightcrawler, garden worm, and red worm are common in turf areas Feed on decaying plant material Come to the surface at night to feed and mate Leave castings - small piles of fecal material They are hermaphroditic with both sexes being present in each worm They lie head to tail to mate Reproductive organs are in the clitellum region Eggs are laid into a pod Damage Beneficial generally Aid in thatch removal and decomposition Aerate the soil with their burrows Enrich the soil with their feces Castings can be a nuisance May harm appearance of turf Can deflect golf ball on greens High sand content greens can result in dulling greens mower blades Overabundance causes problems Soil becomes spongy - making it difficult to mow or even walk across Turf surface becomes uneven with hills and valleys Soil may be so loose as to allow turf roots to dry out resulting in dieback Soil mass will consist of small balls with little cohesion Crayfish Identification Also called crawdads and land crabs Elongate, brownish to reddish with 10 legs First pair of legs are chela - pincers Two pairs of antennae End of tail broadened Larger species are 6-8&quot; as adults Breathe with gills that are at the base of the legs under the carapace Need to keep gills wet Can move long

called honey dew honey dew makes the leaves and fruit sticky honey dew can also be a nutrition source for the growth of sooty mold fungi (not harmful to the plant, but it can make the fruit unsalable) aphids seldom cause much direct injury, unless present in large numbers they may transmit viral diseases Monitoring generally, they are found in clusters on the new growth, stems, buds or on the underside of leaves among the veins look for symptoms weekly consider the weather conditions, presence and abundance of natural enemies, and the value and stage of the crop before spraying Cultural Control start with clean stock there are a wide range of natural predators: lady bugs, lace wings, and predatory wasps Mite Identification .5 mm, oval, greenish-yellow with 2 irregular dark spots on the back Life Cycle overwinters as an egg, a nymph or an adult on old leaves on the ground or in cracks and crevices of old canes when the plant starts to grow, the mites mate and lay eggs on the leaf underside eggs hatch and begin to feed there can be several generations overlapping hot, dry weather favors population explosions Damage Two-spotted Spider Mites feeds on the leaf underside feeding damage causes yellow spots (mottling or stippling) changing to silver or bronze, then brown with leaf crinkling and curling leaves may dry up and fall prematurely high populations will cause loss of plant vigor feeding on primocanes stunts cane growth, therefore, reducing crop potential for the following season dusty conditions will create a larger mite population, causing more problems injury can be worse after harvest Monitoring examine for webbing between or under the leaflets webbing indicates a very heavy infestation damage is most noticeable in dry areas of the field diagnostic tools: breathe on leaflets, this causes the mites to scurry about, or tap the leaf over a white sheet of paper to make the pest visible check the canopy top of the fruiting canes Cultural Control spider mite predators become established as plants mature irrigate regularly to avoid water stress on plants eliminate weeds that can be used as alternate hosts Chemical Control begin the chemical control when mites first appear and repeat as necessary ensure leaf undersides are well covered with insecticide Crown Borers Identification the adult is a clear-winged moth, 25-30 mm long the abdomen is black with yellow bands and stripes on the thorax new larvae are 3 mm long, whitish with brown heads mature larvae are 25 mm long with white bodies and brown heads larvae have six short legs Life Cycle adults appear in August or September females lay 130-150 eggs on the leaf undersides (2-3 per plant) eggs hatch in September and October, larvae crawl down the cane to the base overwinters in tiny blisters on cane just below soil surface larvae emerge the following spring and feed on primocanes through the summer by October, the larvae are nearly full grown and spend the winter in the feeding burrows they burrow further into the crown to feed the following summer in July, they tunnel and pupate a few centimetres near the outside of the cane it takes 2 years to complete the life cycle Raspberry Crown Borer mature larva Damage slows cane growth with the possibility of cane death reduced yields new canes are girdled near the ground canes become spindly and are easily broken may also form galls Monitoring dig the crown out, look for holes and sawdust Cultural Control after harvest, prune out loose canes and ones with galls during the summer, remove \nand destroy wilting canes Raspberry canes damaged by Crown Borer Chemical Control drench cane bases with insecticides in October or early spring (when new shoots are 10 cm high) repeat in 12 months to control subsequent generations using a chemical drench may take 2-3 years to break the life cycle Fruit Worm Identification the adult is a small brown beetle, 4 mm the larva is small (6 mm) and whitish-brown Life Cycle adults lay eggs in early spring on or near the developing blossom clusters and green berries larvae feed in the berry and may be in the fruit at harvest mature larvae drop to the ground and pupate overwinters as an adult Damage presence of yellowish larva on the harvested fruit, making the fruit unsalable adults feed on leaves before they unfold, so leaves have a tattered appearance Chemical Control spray when blossom bud clusters separate and just before blossom opening Raspberry Sawfly Identification the adult sawfly is 5.5 mm long, black with yellowish-red markings the larva is 12 mm long, light green in color, all body segments, except the head, possess a number of whitish bristles Life Cycle adults emerge in the spring (blossom time) they lay eggs in the leaf tissue larvae feed during the summer the larvae drop to the ground, construct a cocoon and overwinters as larvae they pupate in the spring Damage they feed on leaf underside, flower buds, young fruit and tender bark of growing shoots initial damage appears as small holes in leaves they will completely devour the leaves leaving elongated holes between the larger veins the feeding results in weak plants Monitoring during July, watch for holes in the leaves Chemical Control often controlled when spraying for other pests Raspberry leaves damaged by Raspberry Sawfly Wasps/Hornets/Yellow Jackets Identification some
