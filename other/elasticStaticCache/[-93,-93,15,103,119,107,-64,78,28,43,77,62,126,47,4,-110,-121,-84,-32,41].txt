- extend from their margins and flow outwards - may be confined to a valley 6 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION CLASSIFICATION OF GLACIERS (Based on size) &lt;50,00 km2 (subdivided based on landscape position) Ice Shelves - outlets of ice sheets at sea 6 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION CLASSIFICATION OF GLACIERS &lt;50,00 km2 (subdivided based on landscape position) Alpine Glaciers (Valley Glaciers) - glaciers that are confined to valleys - streams of ice may originate in the snow fields of the higher elevations (the width is much smaller than the length) 8 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION CLASSIFICATION OF GLACIERS &lt;50,00 km2 (subdivided based on landscape position) Piedmont Glaciers - - glaciers that occupy broad low lands at the bases of steep mountain and form when one or more alpine glaciers emerge from the confining walls of a valley 9 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIERS AND THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE 24 million km3 (~ 2% of the earth's water) is stored as glacial ice ~ 85% of the volume of fresh water is stored in glaciers and ice sheets - the residence time or the rate of exchange of water between the glaciers and its ocean source is &gt; 8,000 years 10 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION DISTRIBUTION OF GLACIERS Glaciers are not evenly distributed throughout the world - 85% - Antarctica - 10% - Greenland - 5% - rest of the world 10 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION MOVEMENT OF GLACIAL ICE 1) Plastic Deformation (Flow) - ice flows as a result of pressure melting and recrystallization and/or - through solid-state recrystallization or inter- and intra-granular movement of ice * pressure on ice at depth in a glacier causes it to move by plastic flow 12 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIERS AND GLACIAL FLOW 2) Basal slip - the entire glacier move by sliding over the bedrock - aided by melt water that: a) reduces friction for sliding b) provides pore water pressure to lift the ice 13 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIERS AND GLACIAL FLOW - flow within the upper 50 m is passive (carried &quot;piggyback&quot; style on the ice thicker than 50 m) - within the upper 50 m, crevasses are formed if the ice moves over irregular terrain note that crevasses in glaciers do not extend down below 50 m into the zone of plastic flow 14 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION SOURCES OF HEAT TO PRODUCE MELT WATERS 1) heat from refreezing of meltwater (latent heat of fusion) 2) frictional heat (from plastic flow and bedrock contact) 3) geothermal heat from the underlying bedrock (conducted upwards) 4) presence of underlying hot springs and near surface magma bodies 15 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION RATES OF GLACIAL MOVEMENT Variable from glacier to glacier and within glaciers Conditions that affect the rate of glacier movement: - ice thickness - ice temperature - slope of topography 16 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIER MOVEMENT - for glaciers with similar temperature and on similar topographic slopes, thicker glaciers move faster - for glaciers \nwith similar thickness and on similar topographic slopes, warmer glaciers move faster - for glaciers with similar thickness and temperatures, glaciers on steeper slopes move faster 17 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIER MOVEMENT Movement Within Glaciers - variation in flow results from friction between the glacier, the valley walls, and valley floors - experimental evidence shows that the fastest velocities are at the top and center of the glacier 18 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIER MOVEMENT Movement Between Glaciers - some glaciers experience periods of extremely rapid movement called surges - during a surge, the glacier moves at flow rates of ~100 times normal 19 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIER MOVEMENT Causes of Glacial Surges 1) increase in basal sliding due to melting and increased water pressure beneath the ice 2) increase in slope (assisted by the pull of gravity) 20 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL BUDGET - glaciers are dynamic and respond to changes in input to and output from the source of ice - the amount of ice within a glacier is controlled by accumulation (precipitation) and ablation (melting and evaporation) and to a limited extent by transportation from the zone of accumulation to that of ablation 21 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL BUDGET Zone of Accumulation - formation of glacial ice (snow and rain) - glacier thickens (precipitation &gt; wastage) - there is a net gain in the volume of ice Zone of Ablation - destruction of glacier ice (melting and calving) - glacier thins (wastage &gt; accumulation - there is a net loss in the volume of the ice 22 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL BUDGET Equilibrium Line (Snow Line) - a point along the profile of the glacier where accumulation and ablation are equal - there is no net gain or loss in ice volume - distribution of the snow line is controlled by elevation (expression of temperature) - the snow line is at sea level in the poles and at an elevation of ~4500 m at the tropics 23 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION BEHAVIOR OF A GLACIER (ABLATION VS ACCUMULATION) 1) if accumulation exceeds ablation - positive budget - glacier advances 2) if accumulation is less than ablation - negative budget - glacier retreats (recession) 3) if accumulation equals ablation - balanced budget - glacier is stationary (stagnant) 24 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION BEHAVIOR OF A GLACIER (ABLATION VS ACCUMULATION) Regardless of the glacial budget condition, glacial ice continues to move forward even though the glacier as a whole may be stagnant or retreating Flow of glaciers based on the budget: - downwards in the zone of accumulation - lateral at the equilibrium line - upwards in the zone of ablation 25 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS - glaciers modify the landscape extensively - produces landscapes that are unique to glaciation 1) Glacial Erosion 2) Glacial Transportation 3) Glacial Deposition 26 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS 1) Glacial Erosion Plucking - breaking, lifting and removal of fragments of bedrock and sediments by ice (frost action) Abrasion - the scouring, smoothing or polishing action of materials embedded in the ice against the bedrock floor (sandpaper action) 27 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Controls on glacial erosion 1) the rate of glacial movement 2) the thickness of the ice 3) the shape, size, abundance, and hardness of the rock materials in the ice 4) the erodibility of the surface beneath the ice 25 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Erosional Features (Valley or Alpine Glaciers) 1) &quot;U&quot;-shaped glacial troughs as contrasted to &quot;V&quot;-shaped stream valleys (glaciers widens, deepens and straightens stream valleys) - type of valleys - main glacial trough and hanging valleys 29 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Erosional Features (Valley or Alpine Glaciers) 2) Truncated spur - irregular shaped cliff caused by removal of meanders 3) Cirque - a steep-sided, rounded bowl-shaped depression carved into a mountain wall at the head of a valley glacier 30 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Erosional Features (Valley or Alpine Glaciers) 4) Arete - a knife-edge peak formed by sideways erosion of two cirque glaciers 5) Horn - a pyramid-like peak at summits formed by headwards erosion of several coalescing cirques 6) Col - passage or gap formed by back-to-back erosion of cirques 31 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS After Deglaciation 1) Tarn - a lake occupying a cirque basin 2) Pater Noster Lakes - lakes occupying a series of bedrock depressions within a glacial trough and connected to each other by streams 3) Water fall - falls formed by drainage from hanging valleys into the main valley 4) Fiord - a glacial trough drowned by the sea or ocean 32 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Erosional Features - Continental Glaciation 1) scouring action produces glacial flour 2) abrasion by particles in the bottom of the ice produces scratches and grooves in the bedrock 3) plucking action produces streamlined knobs projecting from the land surface called roche moutonnees 33 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION WORK DONE BY GLACIERS Importance of Erosional Features 1) used to determine the type and extent of glaciation 2) used to determine the direction of glacial advance (orientation of scratches and grooves yield the possible linear direction of advance, roche moutonnees show the true direction of ice advance) 34 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL TRANSPORTATION Method of Transportation 1) at the bottom of the glacier or on the bedrock surface 2) within the main glacier and from the coalescing of materials two glaciers 3) at the sides of the glacier next to valley walls 4) on top of the glacier (material from mass wasting) 35 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL TRANSPORTATION Types and Sizes of Material Transported - variable types of material and sizes depending on the nature of the bedrock and the &quot;process&quot; supplying the material - \nthe whole spectrum of rock types and size ranges from clay-size (rock flour) to very large boulder size or greater) 36 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION - Glacier ice is a much more powerful erosive and transportation agent than water or wind because its greater viscosity enables it to carry much larger particles - Material deposited by glaciers is called DRIFT (Drift is a general term for all types of glacial deposits) 37 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Two (2) types of Drift deposits are recognized: 1) Unstratified Drift - Consists of material deposited directly by a glacier (also called TILL) 2) Stratified Drift - consists of material deposited by running water from melting ice (glacial melt waters) 38 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Characteristics of Unstratified Drift (Till) - poorly sorted (boulder - clay size), generally lacks stratification - sizes of particles and mineralogical composition reflect the type of material over which the glacier flowed - contains large rock fragments (Erratics) that have been moved far from their source 39 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of till 1) Moraines - the general term used to describe a wide variety of landforms that are deposited at the edges of glaciers (bottom, sides, middle and end) 40 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of till: Lateral Moraine - deposits of till along the sides of the valley walls (common in valley glaciers) Medial Moraine - deposits of till within the valley from the merging of two or more lateral moraines (common in valley glaciers) 41 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of till: Ground Moraine - smooth-to-gently undulating deposits on the bedrock beneath a glacier (all types) 42 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of till: End Moraine - ridge-like deposit of till at the terminus of a glacier (all types) - Terminal Moraine forms at the furthest point to which the glacier advances - Recessional Moraine forms as the ice retreats ** A glacier has only one terminal moraine but may have several recessional moraines 43 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION 2) Drumlins - streamlined hills generally 1 to 2 km long, 400 to 600 m wide and may occur singly or in large numbers - molded by glaciers from till deposits (usually ground moraines) 44 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION 2) Drumlins - drumlins have a &quot;tear-drop&quot; shape in areal view and are elongated parallel to the direction of glacial movement - in profile, they have a steeper slope facing the direction from which the ice advanced (this can be used to indicate the direction of ice movement) 45 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Stratified drift - stratified drift is deposited by running water from melting ice (glacial melt waters) - melt water is an effective sorting agent depositing large particles near the edge of the glacier and finer particles (gravel-sand-silt-clay) further from the glacier 46 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Stratified drift - the result of melt water activity is a sheet of stratified drift called an OUTWASH PLAIN that extends out from the glacier 47 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 1) Outwash plain - broad extensive plains underlain by outwash from continental glaciers 2) Valley train - narrow and long outwash deposits from valley glaciers 43 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 3) Kames - mound-like hill of stratified drift formed by the deposition of sediments by melt water in crevasses and openings in or on the ice - when the ice melts the stratified drift is left in the form of an isolated or semi-isolated mounds Kame terraces are flat-topped deposits of stratified drift along the valley walls 49 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 3) Esker - a long, narrow, and often sinuous ridges of stratified drift formed by glacial melt streams flowing in tunnels beneath a stagnant glacier 4) Kettle - a depression formed by the subsidence of the surface resulting from the melting of buried ice - if the basin is later filled with water, it is called a kettle lake 50 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 5) Proglacial lakes - lakes fed by melt water that accumulates in low areas on outwash plains or those formed by the damming of valleys by glacial deposits - range from small kettle lake to lakes several 1000 km2 in area 51 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - the earliest explanation of the origins of glacial deposits was attributed to the Biblical flood - Ignatz Venetz (1821), Louis Agassiz (1837) and others first postulated the theory of glaciation - the bases for the theory of widespread glaciation was through the application of the principle of uniformitarianism (examined ancient drift deposits and similar material deposited today) 52 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - the earth has experienced several episodes of widespread continental glaciation - the latest and best understood is the Pleistocene historically referred to as the Great Ice Age - the great ice age began approximately 1.6 million years ago signaling the beginning of the interval of geologic time known as the Pleistocene Epoch 53 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - Pleistocene glaciers covered ~ 40 million km2 or about 30% of the earth's land surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere - this period is marked by four glacial stages (Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian and Wisconsinan) and interglacial stages (Aftonian, Yarmouth, Sangamon and Recent) as recognized in North America 54 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - the occurrence of worldwide glaciation can be explained by assembling the continent together in the south or north pole by plate tectonics 55 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages the onset of glaciation can be explained by the astronomical theory proposed by Milankovitch - \nPrecession - (21,000 yrs) caused by wobbling of the earth's axis - Obliquity - (41,000 yrs) changes in the angle that the earth axis of rotation makes with the plane of the earth's orbit - Ellipiticity - (100,000 yrs) variation in the shape of the earth's orbit , changing the earth to sun distance 56 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages Other minor triggers of glaciation - plate tectonics resulting in the assemblage of continents in cold regions such as the north and south pole for extensive periods of time - volcanic activity resulting in particulate discharge into the atmosphere thereby reducing global temperature and triggering glaciation 57 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages Indirect effects of advances and retreats of continental glaciers 1) forced migrations 2) changes in river drainage routes 3) crustal depression and rebound in the centers of the ice accumulation 4) raised shore lines and shoreline terraces 58 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages Indirect effects of advances and retreats of continental glaciers 5) rise and fall in sea level 6) formation of fiords 56 CHAPTER 12 GLACIERS AND GLACIATION GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages Indirect effects of advances and retreats of continental glaciers - beyond the margins of the glaciers in arid and semi-arid regions temperature were lower and precipitation was moderate - the formation of pluvial lakes in North America, with the greatest concentration in the Basin and Range region of Nevada and Utah (with Lake Bonnevile as the largest) 60",1.8059101104736328],["Erosion caused by wind, water and glaciers can change the Earth's surface over much longer periods of

lagoons--stable coasts south of glacially-effected areas Mangrove swamps--lagoons warm enough to support mangrove trees Features of Barrier Island/Lagoon Sequences Brackish water--sea water diluted by river runoff, lower than normal salinity Tidal channels--cuts through barrier islands with flood and ebb tide deltas Salt marshes--quiet coastal marshes with high biologic productivity Coral Reefs : complex shallow water communities supported by a framework Require warm water, strong sunlight, a hard substrate, no sediment input 1) Fringing reefs--initial reefs attached directly to volcanic oceanic island 2) Barrier reefs--reefs separated from an island by a lagoon due to subsidence 3) Atolls--isolated rings of reef from which a former island has submerged Chapter 16: Earth Resources Renewable Resources--part of geologic cycles, in ever-existing supply Non-renewable Resources--available in limited quantities, non-regenerating Water (Renewable) Renewable resource but in a limited supply in desert areas Resource can be destroyed by pollution and salt water incursion Desalination or other processing sometimes necessary to make water useful Raw Materials (Non-renewable) Geologic Concentration Processes: Hydrothermal precipitation--Copper, gold, lead, galena, sphalerite Igneous cooling--feldspar, quartz, lithium, diamonds (from pegmatites) Metamorphism--garnet, talc Evaporation--salt, gypsum, borax Soil leaching--aluminum (from bauxite) Placer sorting--gold, silver, platinum, diamonds Precambrian anoxic environments--iron (from Banded Iron Formations) Metallic vs. Non-metallic resources Underground mining vs. strip mining of ore Some uses of Earth Resources: Building/road materials: quarried rock, gravel, sand, limestone, gypsum Metals: gold, silver, platinum, copper, iron, lead, aluminum, zinc, etc. Abrasives: diamonds, corundum, diatomite Ceramics: clay minerals Fuel: coal, petroleum, natural gas, coal, uranium Gemstones: diamond, corundum, beryl, garnet, topaz, zircon, etc. Energy Resources Non-renewable Fossil fuels (85% of current energy use) Coal--compressed &amp; altered plant remains, must be mined Petroleum &amp; natural gas--kerogen migrates upward into traps Oil shale &amp; tar sands--potentially minable petroleum Nuclear energy (8%)--Uranium is mined for use as nuclear fuel Renewable Hydroelectric power (5%)--electric generation from dammed rivers Geothermal energy (1%)--heat energy from hot spots in earth's crust Biomass energy--burning of food waste, garbage, ethanol, etc. Solar energy--useful for direct heating or electric generation Wind energy--useful in areas with continuous strong winds Tidal, wave, current, &amp;
