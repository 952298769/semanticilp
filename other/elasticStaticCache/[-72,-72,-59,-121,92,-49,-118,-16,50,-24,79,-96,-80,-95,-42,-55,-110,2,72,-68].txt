http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html we will consider just the two most interesting of the leading concepts of what species are the biological species concept the ecological species concept But first, we need to understand two useful ideas reproductive isolation : members of one population do not interbreed successfully with members of another population gene flow : the movement of genes among individuals and groups from parents to offspring, that is, the mixing of genes through mating or from one population to another, by individuals leaving one group and joining another, or by mating between members different groups The biological species concept \"A species is a group of organisms which interbreed in nature and are reproductively isolated from other groups\" this is by far the most widely accepted species concept, but certainly not the only one according to this view, members of a single species are similar to each other because they interbreed the traits of all members of the species are continually getting mixed together, so the population remains a single, fairly uniform group according to this view, species are different from other species because there is no interbreeding between different species there is no exchange of genes between one species and another, so traits don't get mixed between them, and no intermediate forms like \"chorillas\" arise each reproductively isolated population is free to evolve in its own direction, leading to big differences between species The biological species concept emphasizes patterns of gene flow as the main thing that defines and maintains distinct species according to the biological species concept, there is gene flow within species, but not between species the gene flow keeps all organisms in one species similar;",0.9548566341400146],["Animals of the same species would feed on each other.",0.9542198777198792],["3.12(d), dogs and cats could be maintained together in the same primary enclosure, or be
