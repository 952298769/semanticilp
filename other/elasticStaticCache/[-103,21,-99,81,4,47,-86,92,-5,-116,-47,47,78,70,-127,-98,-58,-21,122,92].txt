The simplest illustration of the organisation of the organisms within an ecosystem is the ecological pyramid (food chain). The broad base of primary producers mainly supports overlying layers of herbivores, planktivores and less number of carnivores (predators). Food chains that allow a diversity of species to survive are divided into trophic levels, with plants providing the first trophic level, as they are the primary producers of most food chains. In almost all fresh water ecosystems, animals will be present, and form part of the many grazing food chains in the area. Other organisms leach the energy from dead organic matter forming detritus food chains. Such relationships allow the free flow of organic energy to be passed along from species to species, and provide an environment where food is available for them to survive. Food webs (Figs. 12 to 14) may be described in terms of both energy and nutrient (carbon, nitrogen or phosphorous) flows. The process typically begins with sunlight driven photosynthesis and respiration. Green plants capture energy from sunlight and convert it into living organic plant tissue. Lake photosynthesis includes algae and macrophytes, which together are the primary producers as they create organic material required by other organisms for nutrients and energy. Other fish feed on primary consumers and are called secondary consumers. They constitute the third trophic level. Still larger consumers such as large fish and man are tertiary consumers (fourth trophic level). Hence, energy and nutrients originating from the photosynthetic production of biomass and energy cascade through the food web. Respiration (the oxidation of organic material) releases energy that was originally captured from sunlight through photosynthesis. Decomposers are sinks for plant and animal wastes, but also recycle nutrients for photosynthesis. The amount of dead material in a lake far exceeds the living material.

True independence suggests not being subject to control by others or not requiring or relying on something else. Nourishment is food. Obtaining food independently is most associated with green plants because they are the only organisms that can manufacture food through photosynthesis (obtaining energy from sunlight and storing that energy as sugar). Since palm trees are the only green plants listed, that is the correct answer. All organisms depend on a food chain to obtain nourishment. All food chains start with the sun and transfer energy to green plants (the producers). Animals are either primary or secondary consumers and must get their energy from eating plants or other animals.",1.5426496267318726],["Flow of energy and matter in ecosystems: Students learn that all organisms need energy in order to live. Organisms use energy to move, grow, reproduce, and more. Organisms also need materials to build and repair their bodies. In almost all ecosystems, the energy in the ecosystem comes from sunlight. Producers, such as plants and algae, get their energy directly from sunlight, and get the materials they need from air and water. Consumers get their energy and materials by eating other organisms. Ecologists classify consumers based on what kinds of organisms they eat: herbivores eat producers; carnivores eat other animals; omnivores eat both producers and animals; decomposers get their energy and materials from droppings and dead organisms. When a consumer eats another organism, it never gets all of the energy that organism has taken in. Some of the energy has already been used by the organism being eaten and some is left in body parts that can’t be eaten. For this reason, there is less and less energy available as you move up in an ecosystem from producers, to herbivores, to omnivores and carnivores. Because of this, in almost any ecosystem there are fewer herbivores than producers, and fewer carnivores than herbivores. Ecologists make diagrams such as food chains and food webs to help make clear what eats what in an ecosystem.",1.5315651893615723],["All organisms that are the same number of energy transfers away from the original source of energy (for example, sunlight) that enters an ecosystem.",1.5286966562271118],["Sunlight provides the energy that drives nearly all ecosystems although only photosynthetic organisms use it directly as an energy source.",1.5286966562271118],["Sunlight provides the energy that drives nearly all ecosystems although only photosynthetic organisms use it directly as an energy source.",1.5286966562271118],["Like we said above, all the energy made in the food chain comes from the producers, or plants, converting sunlight into energy with photosynthesis.",1.5265851020812988],["Sunlight is the initial energy source for most life on Earth.",1.5249474048614502],["Sunlight is the initial energy source for most life on Earth.",1.5249474048614502],["Sunlight is the source of energy for most living things.",1.5249474048614502]]
