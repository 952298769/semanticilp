patterns of stars in the sky Describe the work of an astronomer and become aware of some well known astronomers Discuss the value of using observational tools (e.g. binoculars, telescopes) for

animals using simple classification keys Describe how certain attributes or characteristics of animals are related to their life functions or behaviors (e.g. bird's beaks and bird feet) Describe/identify similarities and differences among multiple offspring of same parents, and between parents and offspring Given data on inherited characteristics explain how traits are passed from generation to generation Identify major body structures of some common animals (e.g. skeleton, digestive) Identify the major anatomical features of animals, and the major function of each Explain how certain structures are related to the successful survival of that animal (e.g. fish are streamlined, carnivores have sharp teeth) Relate the structure of body parts to function (e.g. when presented with teeth or models of teeth from various animals, students can make inferences concerning what the animal eats Identify major internal systems of animals and associate them with their function (e.g. circulatory system--blood flow, nervous system-- sensation) Examine the needs of several animals and determine how the conditions of a particular habitat can limit the kinds of organisms living there (e.g. food, shelter) Describe relationships and patterns of interdependence (e.g. food chains or webs, water or land) among organisms in particular habitats Identify and discuss environmental issues which impact on local animals (e.g. land clearing, filling in wetlands) Place common animals and plants in simple food chains Observe the development of various animals and use those observations to
