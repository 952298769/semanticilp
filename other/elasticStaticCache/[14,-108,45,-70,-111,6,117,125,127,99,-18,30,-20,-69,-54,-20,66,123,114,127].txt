[["An egret is a large bird that lives in wetland habitats. Wetlands are areas that are covered by shallow water for part of the year. Marshes and swamps are examples of wetlands. Habitats include both living and nonliving parts. The living things in a wetland include birds, fish, frogs, and insects. The nonliving things include water, soil, sunlight, and air.",2.826019525527954],["Ecosystems: Ecosystems are groups of living and nonliving things that function together in a particular environment. For example, prairie dogs, birds, insects, low-lying grasses, and shrubs (living elements) interact with each other as well as with dry soil, high winds, and occasional downpours (nonliving elements) to make up the shortgrass prairie ecosystem.",2.5509402751922607],["a) Things that could be living/nonliving to present to the class: Myself, a shoe, a tree (pointing to a tree), my phone, and a bird (pointing to a bird).",2.381197929382324],["a) Things that could be living/nonliving to present to the class: Myself, a shoe, a tree (pointing to a tree), my phone, and a bird (pointing to a bird).",2.381197929382324],["K-Gr 2â€”These repetitious books do little to tie information to particular habitats. After a brief definition (e.g., \"A mountain is a rocky, tall landform\"), the texts contrast living and nonliving things. Simple sentences assert that living things need food, water, air, and sunlight. They grow, change, and move on their own. Nonliving things do not. After applying these characteristics to six examples, the books challenge readers to categorize a seventh item. Five volumes include a rock as a nonliving example, and Mountains asks readers to identify if a rock is living or not. Instead of naming habitat-specific animals, the titles mention \"a bird\" or \"a lizard.\" Each brief picture glossary repeats again \"living\" and \"nonliving\" and defines \"sunlight\" as \"light from the sun.\" Insistence on sunlight as a requirement for living is inaccurate. Carol K. Lindeen's Living and Nonliving (Capstone, 2008) covers essential concepts in a single volume.",2.2706146240234375]]
