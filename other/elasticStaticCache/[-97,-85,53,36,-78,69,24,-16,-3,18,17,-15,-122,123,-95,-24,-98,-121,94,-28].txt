in the hills between the two elms how that patch of blue changes in the high wind south wind a south wind the yellow cat lies down under a chair solar eclipse fire-white halo at the moment of eclipse I notice your face solar dust visible during eclipse all over the room dappled forest floor the eclipsed sun in a myriad of leaves under trees a thousand crescent suns eclipsed by leaves stars spindrift falling into the sea stars between stars harp chords stringing unearthly lights sleepless another bright star descends into sea mist glass in granite tide pools glitter stars all the stars at my feet the flashlight wavers crossing darkness of deep space each star flat sea night faint wake of clear eyes gazing star to star Venus and the moon in conjunction with my blankets and me twinkling with laughter stars my old flashlight low desert campfire a shower of sparks again stars white water the path to the valley full of stars a window opens on the midnight sea all the stars a shower of stars dampened by the roar of a wave a rim of wild foaming surf crab nebula high winds stars spinning by in perfect circles Venus watching you sleep with me into the sea a shower of stars dark edge of land night sky so filled with stars gulls do sleep open window stars drift in on sea mist stars in a basket broken on white stones my staring eyes creating in the night sky one star \nafter another stars scratched in the night light wheels sunset the show begins with stars velvet nights the desert wind warm with stars a blaze out of the big dipper a shooting star sharing the night atop a remote mountain the brightest star extinguished a candle leaves the night filled with stars summer night every star also hot hot night all the stars out naked counting stars these two small eyes close in sleep night of stars on her lips his stars of night twinkling stars splashes of light on dark wet oars August night the melon moon seeding the stars riddles the stars answer woods so still one can hear the stars burning close storm storm purple hills grass green hills pinned with a wet blue fence summer moon summer moon feeling our love warm the night summer moon in our eyes only each other summer moon listening to our words hides in the pines summer moon-viewing kids squat in a circle to knuckle-shoot marbles meeting the moon on ash meadows summer hiker melted a hole the moon slipped in a summer sky summer moon on the tails of fireflies fire flies summer moon a jar of fireflies by a sleeping child hot weather the inflated moon rises in the heat sun seaside sun burnished by waves salt air hot tub a blazing sun enters the ocean rolling east to west the desert sun flattens low hills cooling shadows the curve of rock around the sun desert sun greeting the morning in a hot tub purple skies melting into lava peaks sun glow without wind desert sun slides into the narrowest crack dark brown the desert sun tans wooden buildings golden granite rolls to the horizon a desert sun desert sun on leafless things growing sunrise cloudy sunrise all the bird song colors on rounded raindrops a warm glow over lava mountains sunrise morning rise the desert sun comes cooled to return to this place the sun rises higher sunset waiting for sunset the eastern hills redden at our impatience sunset from below the canyon night sunset clouds Grand Canyon in the sky sunsets below the canyon rim another world sunset snapping twigs a campfire warm/cool the mountain/valley sunset/moonrise blood-red skies sweeping out to sea sunset sunset lava mountain fires again incoming tide to cover wet rocks the glare of sunset sunset beyond land's end fire into water Pacific rimmed fire explodes into water sunset sky sunset a hunter hawk drops back into his shadow setting sun on riverside cabins windows of water back in their cars sunset leaves in the tourist's eyes sunsets into a valley a column of light sunset a vacation ends in the sea red hot skies coming home at sunset fire gods on the stairs the sinking sun climbs up again sunset a western range rises as night sky sunshine sunshine a path through mountains east to west beach houses blowing bright sunshine between them desert salt lake preserving the last sunlight off and on the message of sunlight on a calm lake sunlight the yellow tablecloth rumpled by our laughter sunspots blown about by magnetic storms sun spots draw us thunder stuttering rolls from hill to hill thunder Yosemite falls thunderheads gather more at the top electricity into tree roots thunder heavy thunder dropping down of light rain thunderstorm thunderstorm yet on the far ridge sunset perfect stillness thunderstorm in the stovepipe soot falls old film on remote mountain TV thunder and lightning quiet now everyone talking about the thunderstorm twilight twilight some of the light underwater in a white stone wind wind time desert clouds blow light into sunrise desert wind pale blue shadow moving slightly desert winds blowing mountains into the sun summer winds lined by the appetites of spiders rock formations someone in the wind with a fantasy sunset winds a screen door opens and closes itself wind - cool red rock
