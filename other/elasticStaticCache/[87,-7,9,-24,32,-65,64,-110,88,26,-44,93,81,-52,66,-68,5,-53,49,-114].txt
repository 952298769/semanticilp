less expensive, very accurate Cons - Fragile, numbers are hard to read, fussy children may not stay still for use of this type of thermometer Axillary temperature Hold tip of thermometer in the middle of the armpit with one hand Use your other hand to hold your child's arm snugly against his side Hold the thermometer in place 3 to 4 minutes Oral temperature Take an oral temperature only if your child is cooperative, and is 5 years of age or older Younger children may bite and break the thermometer Wait at least 10 minutes after your child drinks hot or cold liquids before taking temperature Have your child sit or lie down Put the tip of the thermometer under your child's tongue Tell your child to close his lips tightly but not to bite the thermometer Keep the thermometer in place for 2 to 3 minutes Never leave your child alone with the thermometer in his mouth Reading a mercury thermometer Use your thumb and first 2 fingers to hold the thermometer by the end opposite the bulb Hold the thermometer horizontally at eye level Slowly turn the thermometer until the mercury column can be clearly seen Compare the mercury column against the row of numbers along the side The space between the longer lines is 1 (one degree) The space between each short line is 0.2 (two-tenths of a degree) read the short lines as two-tenths, four-tenths, six-tenths, eight-tenths Read the long line just to the left (toward the bulb end).",1.7728209495544434],["From the Tables take the true boiling-point temperature for the pressure observed in (c), find the corrections of the thermometer for the scale-readings observed in (b) and (c).",1.770881175994873]]
