the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta) and the shell itself this advancement allowed the early amniotes to become independent of water for reproduction and successfully invade a terrestrial environment Characteristics of a reptile -
