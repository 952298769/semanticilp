field, with many questions left to be resolved this direct evidence comes from paleontology the study of fossilized animal and plant remains for animals, usually bones occasionally, other body parts and evidence of them usually, when an animal or plant dies, the bones and other parts of a dead animal or plant rot, weather, and decay away under some rare circumstances, bones can be preserved as fossils the most common form of fossil is formed when the organic material gradually dissolves away and is replaced by minerals that crystallize out of ground water this creates a rock in the exact shape of the bone which is then very durable, and may last long enough to be found and studied the study of fossils is paleontology , done by paleontologists most paleontologists study extinct animals (and plants) that are not primates, as the evolutionary arm of biology the study of fossils \nof animals ancestral to humans and our close relatives is a sub-specialty often called paleoanthropology , done by paleoanthropologists by the way, archaeologists like me do not normally study fossils we study the material evidence of cultural activity by people that is, artifacts, fire pits, living places, buildings, garbage dumps, burials, etc. sometimes that includes the remains of human bodies or other animals this stuff is usually much younger than any fossils so a guaranteed way to irk an archaeologist is to ask him or her if she has found any good dinosaurs recently as you'll see, you don't want to say that to a paleoanthropologist, either... fossils of bones and teeth can tell us a lot about what extinct animals were like not only their body shapes, but also normal forms of locomotion general kind of diet general kind of environment they lived in sometimes something about mating strategies, social groups, etc. and also their phylogeny which ones were ancestral to which paleoanthropologists are also interested in the fossils of other, non-primate animals and plants found with

life-WILLIAM SMITH (1769-1839), in the course of working on canal excavations all over England, noticed that the same series of fossil assemblages could be found again and again-he was eventually able to predict both the order of fossil assemblages and the thickness of a given stratum at any locality before a hole was even dug-he could do this because he realized that the slabs of sedimentary rock were draped over he each other like a stack of really thick blankets on a badly made bed-each layer had a characteristic group of fossils in it that were found where ever that layer of rock was found-Smith had been in charge of digging a lot of holes and had traced each stratum laterally over great distances Smith, like most engineers, was not a philosopher and drew no grand conclusions from his work-it was simply a practical tool to use in canal and mine construction-he didn't care whether the fossils represented organic remains or were simply \"sports of nature\"-he had no interest in whether or not he was documenting the evolution of the earth, but other people looked at his work and realized that he was Smith invented STRATIGRAPHY without realizing its implications-we will get to this topic later in the semester-for now it is important to realized that Smith used FOSSILS to create an ORDINAL SYSTEM for organizing rocks-an ordinal system is one that imposes order by describing a unique series of events-anywhere you find any part of that unique series of events, you have found a part of that system-in this case the system was describing the series of events that is the history of the earth-the events are recognized by the groups of fossils that define them on a much shorter timescale think of the artifacts that characterize the post-war decades in US history-if you see black&amp;white TVs, cars with big tail fins, women wearing bobby sox and men wearing pompadours, you know you are within about 5 years of 1957-if you see lava lamps, leather jackets with long fringes, and eight track tapes, you know you are within 5 year of 1967-and so on-paleontologists do the same thing with fossils, except they have look at rocks and sediments instead of archive footage in libraries and boxes in attics this means that to understand the evolution of the earth, it would help if you could recognize some fossils-in order to keep all the fossils straight, it will help if you know how biota are classified EARLIEST FOSSIL EVIDENCE it is possible, in theory, that whole other kingdoms of biota existed, but we have found no fossil evidence as yet earliest fossils are of prokaryotic organisms in rocks ~3.5 billion years old-this is approximately a billion years after the earth \nis thought to have formed and is in the early part of what is called the ARCHEAN EON the cells of prokaryotes lack nuclei and the DNA is not arranged in chromosomes-modern representatives include the misnamed \"blue-green algae\" or CYANOBACTERIA-cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and produced much of the free oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for subsequent life forms-modern cyanobacteria look very similar to their fossilized ancestors preserved in rocks that are billions of years old cyanobacteria accumulate in mats in shallow saline waters and biomineralize calcite-the layer of bacteria smothers and a new layer forms over it, along with a new layer of calcite-the resulting structure is called a STROMATOLITE-they have been found in Archean rocks and they still grow today in a few isolated locations in western Australia, Belize, and the Bahamas LIFE GETS MORE COMPLICATED the first eukaryotes, cells with nuclei and chromosomes, appear in the fossil record at 1.4 billion years before present-this part of the geological time scale is called the PROTEROZOIC EON-there is good evidence that eukaryotes arose from symbiotic combinations of prokaryotic organisms-the presence of mitochondrial DNA distinct from cellular DNA was one of the earlier pieces of evidence toward this theory, which has been championed by Lynn Margulis since the 1970s-modern examples of single-celled eukaryotes include yeasts, many types of algae, protozoans like Amoeba and Paramecium and marine microplankton the oldest known eukaryotes are green algae-these fossils are found in rocks that may be as old as 2.0 Ba and are definitely at least 1.8 Ba-fossil prokaryotes are told from fossil eukaryotes based mostly on size-modern prokaryotes are rarely as large as 60 microns, while modern eukaryotes are typically more than 200 microns long-eurkaryotic organisms require AEROBIC conditions (free oxygen is present) to survive-these fossils tell us that earth's atmosphere had become aerobic by 2.0 Ba-by 1.25 Ba the first multicellular algae (seaweeds) had appeared in the fossil record the Bitter Springs Formation in central Australia was deposited 0.8-0.75 Ba-fossils of green algae occur in TETRADS in these rocks, which is consistent with MEIOTIC CELL DIVISION typical of eukaryotes and unknown in prokaryotes LIFE GETS MULTICELLULAR late Proterozoic trace fossils of burrows suggest the presence of primitive worms from nearly 700 Ma-the shapes of the burrows suggest that the organisms that made them were more rigid than a single-celled motile organism could be-even multicellular organisms without skeletons of any kind can make their bodies more rigid than the cell membrane of a single-celled organism EDIACARAN (or VENDIAN) FAUNA-in Ediacara Hills of Flinders Range in western Australia-670 Ma-soft-parts of about 30 different large multi-cellular animals are preserved as MOLDS-mixture of recognizable forms, like worms, and body plans that do not resemble any subsequent life forms-few of the Ediacaran fauna belong to familiar phyla-some workers believe that they may not be the ancestors of later metazoans, but an entire kingdom that did not survive the Proterozoic-however, the Ediacaran fauna does include undisputed Cnidaria, which do have modern relative, but are not ancestral to most metazoans For more on this topic see Ediacaran fauna a significant aspect of the Ediacaran fauna is that it made up of HETEROTROPHS-organisms that eat other organisms or detris for nutrition-all previous life forms had been AUTOTROPHIC and produced their own food through either photosynthesis or chemosythesis MULTICELLULARITY CATCHES ON by the end of the Proterozoic three of the five surviving kingdoms had evolved-the Monera, the Protoctista and the Animalia-the Cnidaria of the Ediacararan fauna are the first acoelomates-the first coelomates occur in the last 35 m.y. of the Proterozoic, an interval called the TOMMOTIAN-these animals are referred to as the SMALL SCALY FAUNA (or Tommotian fauna)-they are typically less than 2 mm and the 'shells' are composed of CALCIUM PHOSPHATE-few of these 'shells' appear to cover complete animals, but instead are pieces of more extensive armoring CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION in the lower Cambrian there a geologically sudden increase in the diversity of life preserved to the fossil record-representatives of two different kingdoms-the Protoctista and the Animalia-independently developed BIOMINERALIZATION-the manufacture of minerals by living organisms-while the organisms were alive, these biomineralized skeletons probably provided protection from predation and from the physical elements-after the organism died it provides geologists with a record of the organism's existence-the shells of many biota that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion were made of calcium phoshate-apparently the environment was very rich in phosphate at the time-later the most common biominerals became CALCIUM CARBONATE and SILICA SAMPLE PRODUCTS OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION kingdom PROTOCTISTA phylum SARCOMASTIGOPHORA foraminifera radiolaria kingdom ANIMALIA phylum PORIFERA sponges phylum ARCHEOCYATHA (Cambrian only) phylum ARTHROPODA (e.g., trilobites) phylum MOLLUSCA (e.g., clams, snails, nautiloids) phylum ECHINODERMATA (e.g., starfish, urchins, crinoids) the emergence of large 'shelly' metazoans and protists with mineral shells vastly increased the volume of the fossil record-exoskeletons were either AGGLUTINATED (pieces of sediment glued together) or SECRETED (biomineralized) trilobites appeared ~527 Ma and typically comprised more than 90% of the shelly fauna of the Cambrian period-inarticulate brachiopods comprised 5-7% and the other phyla make up the remainder-despite the dominance of the trilobites nearly all the other existing phyla (including the chordates) first appeared during the 30 m.y. that make up the Cambrian period THE BURGESS SHALE in addition to phyla that still exist, several phyla developed during the Cambrian (or the Proterozoic and existed until the Cambrian), but did not survive into the Ordovician period-we know this because of the discovery of LAGERSTATTEN in a few locations around the world-these deposits preserve fossilized remains of both the shelly hard-parts and outlines of the organic \nsoft parts of a fauna the Burgess Shale is located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia and is a middle Cambrian rock formation-when it was first discovered in the early 20th century by Charles Doolittle Walcott the fauna were shoe-horned into existing phyla because at the time paleontologists could not conceive of entire extinct phyla-in the 1960s and 70s the fossils were re-examined-the fossils that were entirely soft-bodied organisms were reassigned to newly erected phyla-the 'Burgess Shale fauna' has since been found in other middle Cambrian lagerstatten around the world, but not in any younger lagerstatten a large majority (98",0.6105000376701355],["GENERAL COURSE INFORMATION : Topics to be covered include: Study of rock layers

is getting harder to cope With the devastation all around I try to find hope But I'm disappointed every time I'm at the end of my rope Waiting for humanity to pay for its crime I try to find hope But it is irreversibly too late I was once filled with hope But now I know that which is to be our fate The Weight Of The World I want to see the majesty I want to sense the wonder I want to advert the tragedy I want to stop the blunder The weight of the world The time running out The hate constantly unfurled The crime of silence all about The Pervasive Charade Keep it up Prop it up Never let it fall The pervasive charade Is now spoken By all A Dead Canary In A Coal Mine Like the lemmings Marching to the sea I see all of humanity Racing to the end A dead canary In a coal mine that's me Warning us now The Earth needs to mend To Bare Witness Take a stand Show your voice Together we band For we have no choice But to bare witness To our own desolation Hoodwinked Cheated deceived swindled We've all been hoodwinked A long long time ago The democrats and republicans Devilishly sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future generations Consume Less Running from here to there And then back again and again For this that and all the other Silly useless and wasteful things We no longer are looking to share Like we did way back when Almost everyone helped one another Lost is the happiness this brings Open yourself try voluntary simplicity Learning to consume less is so freeing Show the corporations no complicity Slow down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation A masterful job where PR firms strive And a dumbing down of education Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The place media conglomerates strive And all Hollywood produces obfuscation Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The part for politicians so desperately strive A government act of incautious deliberation Tinkering With Divine Creation Playing with deadly radiation Like a bunch of babbling babies Tinkering with divine creation Never caring about all the maybes Trying to genetically engineer life While your own species goes extinct Lying to hide all inequitable strife When to Earth you are forever linked The Oligarchy Desperate ubiquitous inequalities Executed by the privileged few Horrendous nightmarish actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we act in time Restore the earth or you'll be Taken away to make it fine Distorted Views Misinformation disinformation Cover ups and lies It doesn't matter which administration They're all cut from the same pies Distorted views Slanted news It'll make you numb What right to choose You'll only lose Are the thoughts of some One Every Second They're dying of starvation One every second They're praying for salvation From the misery there born in But we turn our backs Having our own problems getting by Avoiding the horrid facts While the 3rd world babies cry Till death The Beings From Afar The beings from afar Must look at us and laugh Just babies in evolution Crawling down extinction's path John Lennon You made me write the words I do I'll even admit I idolized you Your assassination ended an era so they say But your message still lives in me each day And I'll reach the masses because I feel That certain destruction is for real If our ways don't change from what is now And stop the killing weapons we let allow Oh the hypocrisy we let go on The human civilization ends with a con With shortsighted leaders sedating us all Technology betrays with apathy we fall As Confusion Creeps In Coming down on your self As confusion creeps in Forgetting pain ruining health What is moral what is sin Each day blurs by Does anything really matter Alone sometimes I cry Wondering will tomorrow be sadder The Atomic Hump Five evolution's to get it right And here we go again Constantly in conflict and fight I think it's time to say when Enough is enough I'm bored of the game Drop the act of being tough Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end I saw a shadow Lurked in the darkness I thought security Because the article How many times I've past before Those iron gates Can I cry once more Since I was five I've heard the words Now only vinyl Is left to hear The Tears Did Shed For You Billy Will it get better Will it get worse There's rainy weather With a black hearse The tears did shed While not believing A word you said So much grieving Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn away It starts in you It starts in me Help restore our earth So future generations can be We Make Each minute that passes 100 acres of tropical forest Goes never to come back Within just one hour 4000 \nchildren starve to death While surplus crops go bad Every day that goes by There are 27 oil spills In the United States alone In one orbit around the sun More than a trillion dollars Of killing weapons we make In Order To Exist Its come so quick Its hard to tell In just a flick We've emptied the well Foresight is cheap When it's too late We're sinking in deep Still wanting the bait Computer malfunction Warning overload Drastic measures needed In order to continue We must all realize this is it We must change In order to exist As If By Divine Plan Take some time And think about this Listen real careful Cause there's no time to miss It's getting beyond reach It's gotten out of hand The power hungry preach As if by divine plan And you don't know Or just let it go by And you're always on the go But always asking why They drain your life Squeeze every last drop Tell you of freedom When looking from the top Groomed Puppets That Deceive How clever the manipulation In this land of the free How money breeds dedication In the name of liberty With political promising lies You know better than believe They're all the same you realize Groomed puppets that deceive So you give up hope Believing it will never change Apathy is how you cope Something you always found strange Without Deception The ladder of success With cut out steps Leads you nowhere Without deception Too Much Too Soon And Then Well here we are again Apathetic up till the end Too much too soon and then No recourse Take Take Take It's total chaos It's complete madness It can't go on It'll never last Take take take Until no more Is left to give Test Subjects We are the test subjects We are the dying breed We are the last checks Here to balance the greed An awaken you all So we can plant a new seed Knock down the wall That strangles you like a weed We are here to change Extinction to perpetuation Get rid of the strange Leading us to devastation It's all up to us To want a new day With us you can trust We won't lead you astray What's best for all Is the way it will be Knock down the wall For unity is the key And it won't be easy Cause they're set in their way Molded in the cast Until their dying day Which won't be long So we have no time to waste We've already been led along So now we have to haste And think for tomorrow Forget about yesterday It will only bring you sorrow And happiness is the only way Evolution's Choice Is Now Sand slipping through The hour glass Evolution's choice is now Humanity's last pass Won't wait Tomorrow's awareness In vain too late Today's judgment Decides earth's fate You've Given Up Hope You've given up hope You can't change the system Mellowing out with age You no longer try to resist them You've lost your morals They've changed your ways But deep down it eats at you They've trapped you in the maze Torn between the dream you had And the life you live Still knowing your being had But not wanting to give Inhospitable In every way possible We're destroying ourselves Making tomorrow inhospitable As long as today it sells Extinct Is Forever Man's the enemy Technology the tool Extinct is forever Don't be a fool And say it's all right Or laugh it away Stand up and fight Our numbers will say Something positive That will catch like fire An expose all the greedy Cold hearted liars To Shed Some Light I try to write About what I feel is wrong To shed some light About how we're led along In this land of the free We must be brave For our future you see A new road we must pave Playing Fate With Dice We are our own god For good or bad Our earth paradise So don't be mad In the years to come We pay the price Following blinded leaders Playing fate with dice A Merry Go Round It's just the same old game With the played out scenes A merry go round with inbetweens Lost in a fog in a sea of confusion Looking for help through realities illusion Got to break out and get away Or the conditioning ties will stay Trapping you till tomorrow's today Becomes a bitter memory of yesterday Government Sponsored There's no way out Unless you care I can scream and shout About what ain't fair But you've got to change From deep inside Brought up fast and strange Don't run and hide From the troubled day By taking drugs To escape the pain It's a cover up To keep us down Government sponsored Every pound Throw In The Towel Toxic dumps Radiation leaks Cancer lumps Mutated freaks Toxic shock Agent orange Government mock

Pollution pace Elegant dining Atomic tests Silkwood dead Militarily best To beat the red Drug sedaters Alcohol waiters Shut you up Make you give up Take Responsibility Turn away And it only gets worse Stay in the gray Until your in the hearse \nTake responsibility And it can only get better We have the ability It's just the choice of whether We take responsibility Or turn away When Humanity Wept How do you cope With global suicide How do you hope When you turn and hide What is there left For you to believe in When humanity wept Drowned in their grieving I Still Imagine In first grade My President was blown away I wondered why In fifth grade Martin and Robert were filled with lead I began to understand In the summer before high school Morrison was in French soil But no one was there I became scared For John The warmest 8th of December In New York City history I was driving my cab When Vinny broke the news From that day till now At 29 Every time I pass 1 West 72nd street I feel humanity Has no hope But I still imagine A Paradise Yours Pure There's always been war You don't learn by mistakes A paradise yours pure And only one for the takes For Tomorrow Today We're at the time When we can't look away We need a solution For tomorrow today A Handful Of Companies A handful of companies Make the decisions They bought the country Electing their politicians An army full of men To
