paperboard, and yard wastes - most potentially renewable resources - 13% recycled / 87% landfilled or burned Waste management - throwaway/high-waste approach - - solid wastes are left where they are produced, buried, or burned - based on an economic system that encourages waste production and then attempts to manage the wastes in manners that minimize environmental harm Waste prevention - low-waste approach - based on greatly increased recycling, reuse, and waste reduction Burying wastes: sanitary landfills - account for 73% of US wastes - spread in thin layers, compacted, and covered with clays - can be put into operation quickly with low operating costs and can handle large quantities of wastes - areas can be reclaimed as recreational areas when closed - \ntend to be noisy, high traffic flow, and dusty - landfill materials slow to decompose due to compacting, lack of oxygen and water - anaerobic respiration of bacteria produces methane, hydrogen sulfides, and organic compounds - may be collected as fuels Burning: - kills pathogens, reduces volume by 60%, reduces the need for landfill space, and does not require a change in peoples' habits - releases air and gaseous pollutants and generate toxic fly ash and bottom ash - volume decreased but toxicity increased - trash-to-energy - trash burned to generate steam which may be converted to electricity - most mass-burned - everything burned together without separating out hazardous materials Extending resource use through composting, recycling, reusing, reducing HAZARDOUS WASTES Hazardous waste is any
