Chemical weathering is the breakdown of a substance by decomposition resulting in the formation of new mineral matter--water and acids especially carbonic acid (H2CO3) are important agents in this type of weathering Kinds of chemical weathering hydrolysis--is the chemical reaction of water with the substance in which the (OH) in water (HOH) becomes part of the new formed substance-- often silicate minerals will weather this way to form clays solution (leaching)--is the dissolving of substances by acid in waters usually leaving residual nonsolubilized materials--carbonate minerals are especially affected by leaching oxidation--is the reaction of a substance with oxygen causing a rust to form--manganese (Mn) and especially iron (Fe) minerals are affected although there are individual chemical and physical weathering types often combinations of these can affect the total weathering of a substance III.",2.6568455696105957],["It combines with organic material in water to
