main-sequence stars varies from Approximately 3000 o K for M stars to Approximately 50,000 o K for O stars Main-sequence stars are all members of one luminosity class, luminosity class V However, they vary from extremely luminous O stars to very faint M dwarfs Range of about a billion in luminosity Because of their number and common internal structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up main sequence Common type of star in our Galaxy is faint, cool, M-type star, Known as red dwarf Presumably also true for other galaxies, but too faint to prove Mass-Luminosity Relation for Main-Sequence Stars From orbital motion of binary stars, astronomers able to estimate masses of component stars in binary system Observed that masses of main-sequence stars increases from spectral

mass Mathematical form: L a M 4 Other Properties of Main-Sequence Stars Radii of stars on main sequence increases from small radii M dwarfs to large radii O stars Luminosity, temperature, radius, and mass for main sequence stars increases from M to O stars Fundamental property upon which other three depend is mass of gas composing main-sequence stars Red Giants Red giants - second most prominent region in H-R diagram composed bright, cool stars Red giants are luminous stars in spectral classes F, G, K, and M lying above main sequence in region that angles up toward bright, cool stars in upper

supergiants - if late-type stars in classes G, K, and M Blue and red supergiants can be hundreds of thousands of times more luminous than Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and red supergiants White Dwarfs White dwarfs - span spectral classes \nB, A, and F, and composed of faint stars lying below main sequence Note: when star referred to as being \"on\" or \"off main sequence,\" reference is to position in H-R diagram and not to its actual position in space White dwarfs appear to be second most populous region in H-R diagram Supergiants seen at great distance across Galaxy But white dwarfs more numerous only less visible at great distances White dwarfs are typically a few thousandths of luminosity of Sun Surface temperature greater than that of Sun White dwarf stars all possess Masses less than about 1.4 M sun Radii a few hundredths of Sun's
