day Mixed tide: 2 \nhigh and 2 low tides per day but of unequal height Tidal heights are zero at Amphidronic points (points of destructive interference) Bay of Fundy (Canada) tides are up to 50 ft Honolulu has a mixed tide which is ~ 6 ft or less Effect of tides on day length Gravitational energy causing tides is dissipated as friction this is slowing the rotation of the Earth Day length is increasing, but number of days per year is decreasing 350 million years ago 22 hrs/day ~405 days per year 350 million years from now ~ 26 hrs/day ~ 320 days per year With fewer days we will have to make OCN 201 classes longer!",1.1929802894592285],["Day and Night Experiment Educator's Guide to Moon Phases Lunar Lollipops Moon Light, Earth Bright Phases of the Moon Phases of the Moon Experiment
