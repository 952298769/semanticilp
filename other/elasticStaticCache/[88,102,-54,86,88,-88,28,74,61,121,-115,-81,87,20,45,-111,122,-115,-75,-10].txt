Bluegrass Webworm Burrowing Webworm Larvae Elongated, grayish to greenish, caterpillars with brown spots Up to 1&quot; long Lives in a silk-lined tunnel during the day - comes out at night to feed Clips and eats grass where it attaches to the crown Larger Sod and Burrowing Webworms feed on most grass species Bluegrass Webworm feeds on Kentucky bluegrass and bentgrass Results in scattered, irregular brownish areas due to the thatch showing Naturally controlled by microsporidia diseases in damp, cool conditions Large numbers of larvae attract starlings, cowbirds, blackbirds, and other birds Pupate in their tunnels Burrowing webworm spins a thick, white, silk lining for the burrow when ready to pupate which is pulled out by feeding birds Two to three generations per year - larvae overwinter Adults Tan moths that hold their wings tightly against the body making them tube-like Up to 1&quot; long When disturbed, they fly in jerky up-and-down method just a few feet above the turf They fly about 30 feet or less before landing back on the turf Eggs are laid while in flight and hatch in one to two weeks Treatment is warranted two weeks after heavy moth flight if conditions stay dry Black Cutworm Larvae Grayish to black fat caterpillars up to 2&quot; Hide in the thatch during the day Emerge to feed on \ngrass blades and stems at night Damage on golf greens usually appears as circular brown areas where blades and stems have been removed Damage is common near the edge of the green due to larvae living in the thatch off of the green, but coming onto the green at night to feed Due to higher mowing height, feeding on grasses other than on greens, tees, and some fairways is usually not noticeable or important Several generations occur each year from early spring to late fall Adults Adult moths are about 1&quot; long with brownish front wings and grayish hind wings Their wings form a triangular shape when at rest When disturbed, the moths fly high and far before landing They commonly sit on turf during the day This insect does not overwinter in Illinois It flies up from the Gulf states every spring Armyworm Larvae Brownish to blackish caterpillars with orange stripes up to 1 1/2&quot; long Feed primarily on wheat, rye, oats, and other small grain crops May invade adjacent turf areas Eat all of the grass blades in large areas in a single night Masses of caterpillars move across the turf like an invading army Turf damage is uncommon but is impressive and occurs quickly Two generations occur each year in Illinois Adults Adult moths are 1&quot; long and

white band across the body Older nymphs are brownish to black and may have white markings Five nymphal instars Two generations per year Adults overwinter as adults in clumps of grass and under debris Southern chinch bug occurs in southern Illinois Hairy chinch bug occurs in northern Illinois Damage Bugs suck out sap of stems and leaves Bugs also inject salivary fluids into plants Turf turns brownish in patches - large areas turn brown in heavy infestations Damage threshold - 25 bugs per square foot Most common in thatchy turf in dry conditions Greenbug Greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Identification and Life Cycle Green, soft-bodied, pear-shaped aphids with a dark green stripe down the back Pinhead-sized when fully grown Overwinter in the midwest as eggs on turf Migrate into the midwest from southern states on spring weather fronts Multiple generations per year Females give birth to living daughters Males are only produced in the fall and overwintering eggs are laid Damage Feed on the leaves sucking out the sap Cause areas to turn rust-colored First occurs in the shade of trees or buildings and then spreads to other areas Sample area where the green turns to brown Threshold of 300 per square foot causes damage Major pests of wheat, barley, and oats where they develop insecticide resistance Leafhoppers Many species, family Cicadellidae Identification and Life Cycle Wedge-shaped insects that may be green, brown, yellow, or combinations of colors Adults vary from 1/8 to 1/2&quot; depending on species Jump and fly readily when disturbed Commonly seen as small insects jumping and flying ahead of your feet while walking through turf Most overwinter as adults or migrate into the midwest from southern states One to several generations per year depending on species Damage Heavy populations can cause mottling or white areas from their feeding These areas will be yellowish from a distance Usually cause little or no damage - usually are not controlled Clover Mite Clover mite, Bryobia praetiosa Identification and Life Cycle Reddish-brown with 8 red legs First two legs are very elongated Appear as moving specks or pieces of dirt Several generations per year Damage Feeds primarily on clovers - rarely causing turf damage Will migrate into buildings in large numbers Migrate usually in early winter and late spring Primarily migrate up sunny walls - south and west exposures Leaving a 2-3 foot strip of soil without turf next to buildings greatly reduces the migration indoors Winter Grain Mite Winter Grain Mite, Penthaleus major Identification and Life Cycle Adults are olive-black with 8 reddish-orange legs Immatures are reddish-orange and turn darker as they grow Eggs hatch in October Adults present in November Numbers decrease by April and oversummering eggs are laid on turf Occur primarily in northern states Damage Occurs mainly in northwestern portion of the U.S. - Colorado to Oregon Turf turns brown - similar in appearance to winter desiccation or winter-kill NUISANCE PESTS Ants Family Formicidae Identification Many species - ranging from 1/16 to 1/2&quot; long as wingless workers Easily discernable head, thorax, and abdomen waist between thorax and abdomen is pinched-in looks like an hourglass elbowed antennae, may have a posterior stinger Workers are wingless, sterile females Larger, winged individuals are reproductive males and females Leave the nest in large numbers to try to start new colonies Live in colonies with division of labor between workers and reproductives Workers perform various jobs for the colony depending on their age Damage Construct underground nests usually with a mound of loose soil at the entrance Mounds of soil can be several inches high Mounds can overwhelm lawn mowers causing them to stop Mounds on greens can dull greens mower blades Generally beneficial Ants feed on dead and live insects - \nparticularly caterpillars Their tunneling loosens the soil Can cause dieback due to drying roots Increase water movement Provide channels in the soil for root growth Red Imported Fire Ant Gulf coast states from Texas to North Carolina Builds large mounds and eliminate plants on the mounds Mass and sting intruders Sting is painful and causes swelling Aggressive feeder on turf pests Difficult to control ants Hard to get insecticide deep into ant colony to get control New colonies are continually being started Cicada Killer Sphecius speciosus speciosus Identification Yellow and black wasps about 1 1/2&quot; long with reddish transparent wings Attack, sting, and drag cicadas and large katydids into their burrows Lay an egg on the prey Resulting larva eats the insect Emerges as an adult the following year Damage Dig burrows with exit holes 1/4 - 1/2&quot; diameter in sandy and other soil Burrow opening is surrounded with a small amount of fine soil Large wasps are intimidating but unlikely to sting Males patrol aerial territories and confront anything entering the territory More intimidating than the females Unable to sting Commonly a problem on golf courses due to the fear instilled in golfers Ground-Nesting Bees and Wasps Identification Ground bees are various species Tend to be 1/4-1/2&quot; long with gray and black banding Each nest contains only a few bees Usually there are many nests in a small area Unlikely to sting Eastern Yellowjacket is 1/2&quot; long with black and yellow banding Commonly referred to mistakenly as a bee Nest in abandoned rodent burrows Nest builds to several thousand individuals by fall Very likely to sting if disturbed May sting without provocation Nests are started in the spring by overwintering, mated females Nests die out in the fall with young mated females overwintering Nests are not reoccupied although new nests may be built next to old nests Damage Large numbers of bees or wasps are intimidating to people using the turf Yellowjackets are ferocious stingers Stings can be fatal to susceptible people Earthworms Identification Elongate, brownish to reddish, without legs Tunnel through the soil - may come out onto the surface at night The nightcrawler, garden worm, and red worm are common in turf areas Feed on decaying plant material Come to the surface at night to feed and mate Leave castings - small piles of fecal material They are hermaphroditic with both sexes being present in each worm They lie head to tail to mate Reproductive organs are in the clitellum region Eggs are laid into a pod Damage Beneficial generally Aid in thatch removal and decomposition Aerate the soil with their burrows Enrich the soil with their feces Castings can be a nuisance May harm appearance of turf Can deflect golf ball on greens High sand content greens can result in dulling greens mower blades Overabundance causes problems Soil becomes spongy - making it difficult to mow or even walk across Turf surface becomes uneven with hills and valleys Soil may be so loose as to allow turf roots to dry out resulting in dieback Soil mass will consist of small balls with little cohesion Crayfish Identification Also called crawdads and land crabs Elongate, brownish to reddish with 10 legs First pair of legs are chela - pincers Two pairs of antennae End of tail broadened Larger species are 6-8&quot; as adults Breathe with gills that are at the base of the legs under the carapace Need to keep gills wet Can move long distances overland - particularly at night Omnivorous - feeding primarily on dead animals and plants Will feed on live turf and other plants Will eat fish, earthworms, and other small animals Female carries her jellylike eggs and newly hatch young on the underside of the abdomen Most species live only in streams and ponds Species that burrow in dry land also live in streams Damage Some crayfish species dig burrows into the soil, particularly in low-lying areas Construct a chimney around the burrow make of balls of mud Chimney tends to be the height of highest floodwater Burrow will extend down to the groundwater where the crayfish will live Crayfish burrows and their chimneys can cause people to trip Can also damage lawn mowers No labeled pesticides Pesticides applied to burrow can

mature adults - condition known as paedomorphosis most salamanders use internal fertilization, lay eggs and have external development with a larval stage the larval stage looks like the adult, there isn&#146;t a prevalent tadpole stage of development the larva have external gills and a finned tail - the gills are lost upon metamorphosis order Anura - frogs and toads (no tail) the typical amphibian life cycle is exemplified most often in frogs eggs are laid and fertilized externally and develop rapidly into tadpole larvae tadpoles live and grow from 6 months to 2 years before metamorphosing into young froglets which will continue to grow and become sexually mature adults within 1-2 years tadpoles are omnivorous - eat insects, insect larvae, other aquatic eggs, smaller fish and amphibian larvae and plants - algae, mosses, aquatic plants frogs have developed hind limbs specialized for swimming (webbed feet) and leaping most frogs and toads secrete thick mucus from glands in their skin when alarmed many times these secretions smell and taste bad to predators many are poisonous - poison arrow frog of the tropics most secretions contain antimicrobial compounds - magainins (studied in our chem dept many frogs and salamanders too, have chromatophores which allow them to darken or lighten their skin tone which helps with camouflage against stream/pond bottoms or in terrestrial settings - leaves etc. studies of frog and axolotl (salamander) embryos have been the most instrumental in understanding how vertebrate embryogenesis works eggs are large and easily accessible and manipulated have learned how the mesodermal germ layer is specified by the interactions of ectoderm and endoderm have learned how the A-P, D-V and L-R axis form in vertebrates have learned how neurulation takes place have learned how many organ systems originate back to top Chordata Part IV: Reptiles Prevention of egg desiccation critical to leaving aquatic environment completely alteration in development to form special membranes around the developing embryo these membranes are called the amnion, chorion and allantois reptile, bird and mammal embryos form these membranes during embryogenesis these animals are collectively known as amniotes anatomical characteristics allowing division of the amniotes (especially important for paleontology) anatomical structures of the skull allow us to identify three early offshoots from the first amniotic animals anapsids skull has only a depression for the eye socket synapsids skull has a single depression in addition to the eye socket posterior to eye diapsids two additional cavities in the skull posterior and dorsally to eye socket reptiles are represented by two of these divisions - the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta) and the shell itself this advancement allowed the early amniotes to become independent of water for reproduction and successfully invade a terrestrial environment Characteristics of a reptile - distinction from amphibians dermis produces a scaly epidermis which is sometimes shed in some bony plates are produced (turtles, crocodilians) 5 digits on limbs respiration totally by lungs - no gills during development direct development - no larval stage a copulatory organ for internal fertilization all but crocodilians have 3 chambered hearts Class Reptilia Subclass Anapsida - Order Testudines - turtles little changed since they first appear in the fossil record - later Triassic - before the large dinosaurs only living example of anapsids shell is formed from outgrowth of the vertebrae, ribs and sternum dorsal part is carapace, ventral is plastron turtles are one of the few reptiles which have gone back to a marine environment they in fact must go back to land to lay their eggs \nsex determination in turtles is temperature dependent low temperature produces males, high females female can regulate this by depth she buries eggs Subclass Diapsida - order Squamata - squame is a skin scale - lizards and snakes suborder Sauria - lizards lizards show the most modifications and adaptations to their body forms to suit their ecological niche there are legless lizards chameleons use chromatophores to change color for camouflage and moods chameleons also have turret eyes, which can be controlled independently the non-glandular, scaly epidermis which prevents water loss has allowed lizards and snakes to thrive in many arid environments suborder Serpentes - snakes limbs and limb girdles have been lost except for in some of the boa constrictors and pythons many have evolve poisonous venom for use in capturing prey also evolved fangs for delivery of that venom poisonous snakes 2 types with or without fangs with
