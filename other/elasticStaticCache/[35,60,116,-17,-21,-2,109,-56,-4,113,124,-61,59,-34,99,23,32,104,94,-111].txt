Worksheet #9 - PHY102 (Spr. 2000) Solving differential equations: Rocket motion Due March 31st 2000 - two week assignment We study the motion of a rocket (mass m ) launched from earth(mass M ), and hence moving in the gravitational potential energy: (1) The force on the rocket is, (2) We also need the following equations: (i) Angular momentum which is defined to be, (3) where is the radial vector and is the momentum vector and;",1.2520986795425415],["In the case of a water rocket filled with water, what is the momentum of the \"system\" (rocket plus water) when the rocket is standing still and the water is not moving?",1.2339186668395996],["Firstly, the location gives rockets extra momentum entering orbit because the proximity to the equator offers the maximum rotational forces from Earth.",1.2160083055496216],["Firstly, the location gives rockets extra momentum entering orbit because the proximity to the equator offers the \nmaximum rotational forces from Earth.",1.2160083055496216],["Firstly, the location gives rockets extra momentum entering orbit because the proximity to the equator offers the maximum rotational forces from Earth.",1.2160083055496216],["Firstly, the location gives rockets extra momentum entering orbit because the proximity to the equator offers the maximum rotational forces from Earth.",1.2160083055496216],["But the initial momentum, which was zero, must equal the final momentum and so the rocket must move in a direction opposite to the fuel (making the rocket's momentum negative relative to the fuel's momentum) in order for the rocket's momentum to cancel out the momentum of the fuel.",1.1890677213668823],["Rockets A rocket works by conservation of momentum because the resultant external force is zero.",1.1782162189483643],["Rockets A rocket works by conservation of momentum because the resultant external force is zero.",1.1782162189483643],["Rockets A rocket works by conservation of momentum because the resultant external force is zero.",1.1782162189483643],["Rockets A rocket works by conservation of momentum because the resultant external force is zero.",1.1782162189483643],["The thrust is simply generated by the mass of the fuel that is propelled out of the rocket motor at high velocities, typically up to 4,300 m/s.
