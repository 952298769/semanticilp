a-coming And the weather's getting cold I have to watch my brother Tom He's eight years old I never have to worry That he'll slip on ice and fall In fact there's only just one thing That worries me at all Tommy, don't lick that pipe Your tongue will stick like glue I've warned you twice And I wish you'd mind Don't you remember What happened last time You can do about anything else that you like But Tommy, don't lick that pipe Do you still remember Uncle Albert Such scientific curiosity He stuck his tongue out on the old pump handle It took us two whole days to get him free Do you still remember Grandma Dawson She touched her tongue on to a waterspout She said she thought that it was made of plastic It took us until May to thaw her out Do you still remember our dog Fluffy He went outside to do his doggy thing We found him frozen solid to a hydrant We couldn't break him loose until the spring Hot Chocolate (c) 1995 John McCutcheon/Appalsongs (ASCAP) &amp; Si Kahn/Joe Hill Music (ASCAP)

chocolate with a friend of mine Hot chocolate in the summer heat Hot chocolate is a year-round treat Hot chocolate in a paper cup You drink it down and then you fill it up Hot chocolate in a steaming mug Everybody want's to drink it by the jug Put some milk on to heat Add some sugar, make it sweet Now some cocoa, make it brown Stir it up and drink it down Put some water on to brew Add some cocoa,

so cold that you could freeze to death I turn up my collar and the wind starts to blowing Sky turns gray and it starts to snowing I put down my head, it's only two blocks more Make it to my house and the I open the door It smells like winter at our house Smells like winter at our house Smells like winter at our house Smells like soup When my Dad was a kid in my Grandma's home She taught him how to start with an old soup bone You put the onions, carrots, celery, and water in the pot It only takes a little of whatever you've got &quot;There ain't no way to hurry it,&quot; my Grandma would remind &quot;Anything worth waiting for is gonna take time&quot; All day I hear it simmering in the pot Sneak up to the lid, be careful it's hot Lift up the corner and I take a little sniff Close my eyes and take a great big whiff Go and get a tablespoon, to steal a little taste I got a big soup smile all over my face Bean soup, chicken soup with macaroni Cream of broccoli, minestrone Potato soup, tomato soup, chowder made of clam Miso soup, mushroom soup, split pea with ham Bouillon, scallion, tom kha ghai with lemongrass Matzo ball, chilibean, cream of asparagus So it doesn't even matter if the cold winds blow If the rivers freeze and there's three feet of snow From my Dad and my Grandma it's what I got The put a whole lotta love in that old black pot In my mind I see a little boy, a distant

winter Singing their wintersong The old barn creaks as we pitch the hay To the horses who neigh below The bright flames crackle in the burning field Helping next summer's crop to grow The garden has given her final gift The very last pumpkin is gone They're singing their song of the winter Singing their wintersong All for a reason We each have a season We rise and we lay ourselves down Changing and turning Planting and learning `Til, like the sun, we come `round The trees stand traced against the sky Their arms outstretched and bare The squirrels asleep within their nest Find peace and comfort there In months ahead the spring will find The world renewed and strong Now we're singing our song of the winter Singing our wintersong Aurora (c) 1995 John McCutcheon/Appalsongs (ASCAP) &amp;

Aurora dances down When the night leaps out like a fiery spark Aurora dances down Chorus She'll spin and turn and chill and burn Till your knees fall to the ground She wears the starry crown When the moon and sun are joined as one Aurora dances down Oh, the voice will still and the heart will leap When Aurora dances down As the midnight watch I keep When Aurora dances down Every human, bird, and beast Aurora dances down All partake of the swirling feast When Aurora dances down Through the northern sky she bounds Aurora dances down Through every forest, field, and town Aurora dances down She hangs her ribbons burning bright Aurora dances down She weaves the rainbow of the night Aurora dances down Every woman, child, and man Aurora dances down Will in silent wonder stand When Aurora dances
