Population Dynamics of Predation we can look at effects of predation on the population dynamics (i.e., changes in density over time) of both the predator and its prey we will begin by considering a relatively simple model based on differential equations considering just one predator and one prey species: Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model here we have two basic components : C = number (or density) of the consumer (= predator) population N = number (or density or biomass) of the prey or plant population here we have two simultaneous differential equations , one for the prey and one for the predator 1) PREY POPULATION GROWTH RATE: prey population growth rate = exponential birth rate - predator-caused death rate assumption #1 : in the absence of predators, the prey population increases exponentially, i.e., no density-dependence: dN/dt = r N but prey individuals are removed (i.e., killed) by predators: the rate of removal depends on the rate of predator-prey encounters and the efficiency of the predator encounters increase as: 1) the number of predators (C) increase 2) the number of prey (N) increases the predator&#146;s efficiency can be designated a', the &quot;attack rate&quot; of the predator&#151;a' increases with: 1) increasing search efficiency 2) increasing capture efficiency assumption #2 : a' comes from linear functional response: the rate of successful encounters (i.e., the consumption rate) will then be: a'CN and the overall equation for the prey population dynamics becomes: dN/dt = r N - a'CN (a) 2) PREDATOR POPULATION GROWTH RATE: predator population growth rate = birth rate - background mortality rate in the absence of food (prey), individual predators lose weight and starve to death therefore, in this model, predators are assumed to suffer a &quot;background&quot; mortality&#151;decline exponentially through starvation in absence of prey: dC/dt = -qC where: q = mortality rate this lose of predators is counteracted by predator birth, which depends on: 1) the rate at which food (prey) is consumed: a'CN 2) the predator's efficiency (f) of turning this food into predator offspring there are two additional assumptions here: assumption",2.2262141704559326],["What is predation and what kinds of effect does it have on population dynamics?",2.142230749130249],["The striking record of population growth in this population can be attributed to total protection, abundant food, good cover, a lack of predators, a generally improving habitat, and low disease.",2.1076645851135254],["Population densities and population growth rates have increased;",1.9945907592773438],["Population growth rates have increased.",1.9933279752731323],["An increased rate of population growth does seem to have a negative effect on attitude, irrespective of the actual social or economic conditions in the area.",1.952060341835022],["Focussing on anti-predator behaviors in insects, I hope to see whether anti-predator behavior increase population growth rates, dampen cycles, or what.",1.8568521738052368],["Population and Consumption and Global Population Growth and Learn More About Population and the Environment and 6 Billion Human Beings Interactive Site What effect does an increasing population have on the planet?",1.8507120609283447],["This means that an increased mortality rate due to disease and predation by rats and cats, will have a terrible impact on their population.",1.8486411571502686],["What do Huffaker's mite experiments and moose and wolves on Isle Royale illustrate about the effects of predation on population growth rates of predators and prey?",1.84000825881958],["Does the placement effect the population's growth rate.",1.81821608543396],["What is the population growth rate--what does it consist of?",1.807870864868164],["Should we continue to export technology Populations grew because we reduced the death rate by exporting good health care Food to hungry nations what effect does it have in regard to growth?",1.805445909500122],["Taxonomic composition (structure) Trophic ecology (function) Ecological succession Microhabitats Ecological niches (OH) Populations Population structure: virtually all populations are discontinuous Encounter rates among individuals is variable Gene flow may be interrupted Population growth (can be negative) Causes Birth Death Immigration Emigration Exponential growth curve \nFactors limiting population growth Density-independent factors Density-dependent factors Decrease birth rate (e.g. predation) Increase death rate (e.g. food supply, disease) Logistic growth curve -
