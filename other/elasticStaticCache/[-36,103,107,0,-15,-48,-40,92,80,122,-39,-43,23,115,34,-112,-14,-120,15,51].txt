This phenomenon is observed most notably in birds (like those that make long, transoceanic flights) and aquatic mammals (like dolphins and porpoises). Unihemispheric sleep allows aquatic mammals to sleep and continue to swim and surface to breathe. It allows animals to keep track of other group members and watch for predators.
