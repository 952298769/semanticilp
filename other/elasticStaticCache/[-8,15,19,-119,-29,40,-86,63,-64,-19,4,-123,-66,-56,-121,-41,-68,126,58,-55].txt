[["1) For the ONE ramp test Buy 30 circular magnets (with the hole in the middle) from Radio Shack, these cost $1.69 for 5 magnets, so the magnets will cost about $10.00 For the TWO ramp test Buy 50 circular magnets (with the hole in the middle) from Radio Shack, about $17.00 2) Take some stiff cardboard and make two hills (each hill consists of an incline and a decline, experiment with the angle, about 30 degrees) 3) Make three rolls (or five rolls \nif you are using 2 ramps) of 10 magnets each (connect the magnets to form 10 magnet stacks, kind of like a roll of Lifesavers) 4) Tape these magnets together with scotch tape 5) The ones for the side of the ramps are called RUNNERS, one other 10 magnet roll is used as the ROLLER that moves up the incline perpendicularly between the RUNNERS 6) On each ramp (incline), you attach one roll of magnets running up each side, so that's two magnet rolls per incline and NONE on the decline 7) The RUNNER magnets on the sides should arranged to be of opposite polarity, that is, North at the top on one side, South at the top on the opposite side (it doesn't matter which side is N or S, only that they are opposing) 8) The ROLLER should be placed at the base of the ramp with its poles facing like poles on the RUNNERS, since LIKE magnetic poles REPEL, this will provide the repulsion you require to make the ROLLER move up the incline between the RUNNERS.",1.7689296007156372]]
