Edward M The (giant) green iguana is an arboreal (tree living), diurnal (daytime active), lizard that is found in Central and South America With proper care iguanas can live for up to 15 years and grow to a total body length of 6 feet Often times potential iguana owners visit their local pet store to purchase a cute little baby iguana only to find out that when it reaches its full adult size that it has become too much reptile to handle or house For this reason it is important to be sure that before purchasing a green iguana that you are prepared to care for and house this animal for the rest of its life The single most important factor in keeping a healthy iguana is to start off by selecting a healthy iguana from the beginning A healthy young iguana will be curious about its surrounding and will not be lying on the floor of its enclosure Often times we as humans like to select the one iguana in the enclosure that is \"calm\" and sits still while we hold it This is a pretty good sign that something is wrong, because most young iguanas will be fearful of human contact at first since it is in their nature The other fatal mistake that we as humans often make is to select the one iguana that looks sick, because we feel sorry for it and think that if we just take it home we can care for it and bring it back to health If an iguana is showing signs of illness it is a very good bet that the illness has been present for some time and that it has progressed to the point of being critical thus making our attempts to save the \"poor sick iguana \" and effort in futility only to result in our disappointment and the ultimate demise of the animal Avoid this trap by starting off with a health young iguana from the start Proper housing is essential to the care of a captive iguana and much care and consideration should be taken to provide the best possible enclosure A hatchling iguana may be kept in a 10-gallon glass aquarium but will soon require a larger enclosure A 29-gallon aquarium is suitable for a juvenile iguana , but eventually a custom built room sized cage will be required It is important to avoid using screen wire on any enclosure to prevent the iguana from rubbing its nose against it in an effort to escape which can result in rostral abrasions (nose rub) that can become very severe in a short period of time Iguanas require a light cycle of 12-14 hours per day This can best be achieved by providing the iguana with a commercial 50 watt basking bulb placed 6 inches from the top of the enclosure and mounted in a standard clamp type light fixture from any hardware store It has been a long standing rule that iguanas must be provided with a full-spectrum light that provides a UVB of 310 or higher in order for the iguanas to produce vitamin D3 is essential in the absorption of calcium \nIt has recently been determined that iguanas have the capability to either produce their own D3 or to absorb it through their diet 29

leaves and flowers Unfortunately, plants that iguanas eat in the wild are \nnot available to those of us who keep them as pets Therefore, we must offer our iguanas a great selection of vegetables and fruits in order to ensure that they obtain all of the nutrients essential to their survival In the wild, iguanas regularly dine on dozens of different kinds of plants Offering only a few different varieties of vegetables simply will not meet your iguana 's nutritional requirements Any old variety of vegetables, however, might not sustain your iguana for very long Often times, foods of questionable nutritional value are chosen and pet iguanas wind up with illnesses stemming from malnutrition -- usually from calcium deficiency It is the opinion of most herpetologists that the diets of both the juvenile iguana and the adult iguana should be the same ) I have found the follwing approximate breakdown of fruits and vegetables to be an effective approach to feeding my iguanas : In fact, the number one killer of iguanas in captivity is poor diet Also, never forget that you need to choose many different food items regularly in order to keep your iguana healthy Only foods rich in vitamins and minerals should be chosen as staple items in your iguana 's diet But the truth is that I have found combinations of both high greens / low veggies and low greens / high veggies to produce and maintain a thriving iguana I do not believe that you must constrain your iguana 's diet to the same percentage of greens and solid vegetables at all times Enough with the introductions, here is a list of some good foods to use for your iguana 's diet: I usually challenge iguana owners to try to pick out 10-15 varieties of foods for their iguanas when they go to the grocery store You must pick and choose which combinations are the best, depending on what is available in your area, what your iguana likes and dislikes, and even price It should be noted that some iguanas like variety in their diet, and will tire of the same old items Some iguanas , however, do not respond well to new food items so if yours stops eating when new items are introduced, revert to the old but make sure that the
