The hotter something is, the more thermal energy it has.  So when we see the ball bounce back up almost to its original height, we know that it is always a little bit lower than it started because it has transformed some of that original potential energy to thermal energy.",0.9565218687057495],["gravity That which causes things to fall.",0.9537734985351562],["But when the ball gives way to that gravity and does come down, this brings it that much closer to the source of the air jet, which has the effect of blowing it up.",0.9531106948852539],["While in the air, the ball experiences the force of gravity pulling downward and the force of air.",0.9530077576637268],["While in the air, the ball experiences the force of gravity pulling downward and the force of air.",0.9530077576637268],["The amount of downward force on a falling object depends on its weight, which is the interaction of the object’s mass with the force of gravity.
