Google Search )] [ the nature of light ( Online Biology Book )] [ the physics of photosynthesis ( MIT Biology Hypertextbook )] [ index ] (11) Chlorophyll (a) The molecule that does the actual absorption of photons \nin chloroplasts is chlorophyll (b) Chlorophyll is a complex, non-protein, organic-molecule that is embedded, more or less, in the thylakoid membrane (c) See Figure 10.8, Structure of chlorophyll (d) The major function of a chlorophyll molecule is to absorb a photon, using the energy of that photon to boost a specific chlorophyll electron to a higher energy shell (e) Chlorophylls are arrayed into photosystems (f) [ chlorophyl ( Google Search )] [ chlorophyll and accessory pigments ( Online Biology Book )] [ index ] (12) Photosystems (a) Photosystems are two-dimensional arrays of chlorophyll molecules (b) These arrays are found embedded together in the membrane of thylakoids of chloroplasts (c) These arrays serve as photon-gathering antennae (d) Green plants employ two slightly different photosystems termed photosystem I and photosystem II, the former of which (photosystem I) is involved in both non-cyclic and cyclic electron flow (e) See Figure 10.10, How a photosystem harvests light (f) [ photosynthesis photosystem or photosystems ( Google Search )] [ index ] (13) Reaction center (a) When a photon is captured by one chlorophyll of a photosystem , the energy of that photon is passed from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until the energy reaches the photosystem reaction center (b) See Figure 10.10, How a photosystem harvests light (c) Note that it is energy , not electrons (or photons) that are passed from chlorophyll to chlorophyll molecule with a photosystem (d) [ reaction center photosynthesis ( Google Search )] [ index ] (14) Primary electron acceptor (a) The reaction center of a photosystem is a chlorophyll molecule that is associated with the primary electron acceptor (b) The primary electron acceptor accepts the now high-energy electron from the reaction center chlorophyll and passes that electron on to an electron transport chain (c) See Figure 10.10, How a photosystem harvests light (d) [ primary electron acceptor , primary electron acceptor photosynthesis ( Google Search )] [ index ] (15) Oxidation of water (a) Chlorophyll minus its electron (i.e., having passed it on to the primary electron acceptor ) is a very strong oxidizer (b) To proceed with another round of photon absorption, the reaction center chlorophyll must obtain a replacement electron (c) This replacement electron, in green plants , is obtained, in certain circumstances, from water : (i) Chlorophyll 2+ + H 2 O chlorophyll 0 + 2H + + O 2 (d) Note that the O 2 generated by photosynthesis comes from water, not from CO 2
