the consulting relationship If the process is completely new Study the actions people currently take Build scenarios for people to simulate the process Study similar types of work (this is better) E.g. study salesmen who spend most of their time away from the home office to understand telecommuting issues If you can't get to the user's site Use surveys and telephone interviews Have users write prose task scenarios Hold roundtable discussions with users at your site: Users bring multiple artifacts related to projects Walk users through their work tasks, using the artifacts to support the conversation Make sure that users do not disclose confidential information Do 3-4 interviews per topic Expect interviews to take about 1 hour Compensating customers Send a thank-you letter to participants and their supervisors When the product comes out send a newsletter around to the participants citing the influence they had Give them something, not necessarily money (T- shirts, mugs, free software) Choose users who want to contribute The Interview Setting up the interview Make sure the interviewee knows what to expect Explain your motivation for doing the inquiry Send a letter describing what you will do and what you want to find out about Call user the day before to make sure they are still prepared Ask them to save typical tasks until you get there Ask them to collect

than a specific product idea (e.g. you want to support telecommuting) Identify the market segments Ask how they do their job Ask what different ways you might meet their need Set up interviews to see the work you think you might be able to affect Make sure you set up with the user's managers Who should interview Include others in your organization (especially developers) to help you, to learn the techniques, and to understand how you collected the data so they don't discount the findings Get as many people into the field as is reasonable- -spread the experience of dealing with users around Interview \nsingly or in pairs Second interviewer adds a lot of benefit-catches information that first interviewer might miss, especially in highly technical domain areas Pair people with different

cover more roles and tasks and see more of the work practice Preparing for the interview Some prefer to do contextual observation first Many find it useful to find out about the user before the observation Do a normal interview with the user at the beginning to get them used to talking about what they're doing Do a task analysis with the user before the observation See a demo of how they work ahead of time Get documentation of their processes ahead of time Hold a group discussion with the users to describe the process as they understand it, then do one-on-one interviews as a reality
