Write & Wrong Critique this song I Hear The Thunder &copy 1999 - David Erickson DSE87@aol.com I Hear The Thunder And in the air I smell the coming rain And I don't wonder Why I'm glad a storm has come again Its been too long since I have heard the thunder roll And I so need the rain to cleanse my tortured soul So as the first few drops roll down my window pane I close my eyes And I step out in the rain You used to love it You loved the feel of rain upon your skin I was above it Said you didn't have the sense to come in And so you walked alone while I remained inside And when at last you walked away for forever I denied That your leaving caused me any kind of pain And that evening I went walking in the rain CHORUS: Oh how I wish the rain would fall unending I'd spend my lifetime walking in the rain Then I wouldn't have to spend my life pretending That my life without you wasn't filled with pain I need the rain to cleanse my broken spirit A place to face the pain that I'm denying And if a sob escapes my throat no one will hear it For in the rain no one can tell your crying If we were talking I'd ask if you were ever in this place When you were walking Did tears fall with the raindrops down your face Did you too hide your feelings from me in the rain Did you seek the storm clouds when when your eyes would cloud with pain If I had walked with you then would you now be here Would we need the rain To wash away our tears I Hear The Thunder The storm has passed, the sun is breaking through I have to wonder If you know how much my heart is breaking too If the storm that brought the rain could bring me back to you I can't promise its the last storm that we would go through But what I'll promise you is that despite the weather Through tears and smiles We'll always walk together CHORUS TAG: I hear the thunder I hear the thunder Critiques: by Denis Brochu Critique this song.",1.1655160188674927],["it was raining more heavily now, and from time to time a gust of wind rattled the small windows in their dilapidated frames, or hurled a shower of heavy drops against the panes.",1.1612217426300049],["it was raining more heavily now, and from time to time a gust of wind rattled the small windows in their dilapidated frames, or hurled a shower of heavy drops against the panes.",1.1612217426300049],["Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.",1.1154451370239258],["Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.",1.1154451370239258],["The weather was comfortless and stormy: The wind howled around the House, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain pattered against the windows.",1.1154451370239258],["the wind howled around the house, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain pattered against the windows.",1.1154451370239258],["The November storm that had raged earlier, rattling the house and sheeting its windows with rain, had clearly stopped.",1.1154451370239258],["Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house \nshook and rattled.",1.1154451370239258]]
