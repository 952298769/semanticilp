weather patterns change over the seasons (K) Knows that the Sun provides the light and heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the Earth (2) Level II Knows that water can change from one state to another (solid, liquid, gas) through various processes (e.g., freezing, condensation, precipitation, evaporation) but the amount of water stays the same (3) Knows that clouds and fog are made of tiny droplets of water (3) Knows that night and day are caused by the Earth&#146;s rotation on its axis (3) Knows the major differences between fresh water and ocean water (3) Level III Knows that the Earth is the only body in our solar system that appears able to support life (5) Knows that the Earth is comprised of layers including a core, mantle, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere (7)

affect weather and climate (e.g., precipitation, reflection of light from the Sun, retention of heat energy emitted from the Earth&#146;s surface, the effects of volcanos and other catastrophic

that the Sun is the principle energy source for phenomena on the Earth&#146;s surface (e.g., winds, ocean currents, the water cycle, plant growth) (6) Knows how the tilt of the Earth&#146;s axis and

Sun) (7) Knows the processes involved in the water cycle (e.g., evaporation, condensation, precipitation, surface run-off, infiltration and their effects on climactic patterns) (7) Level IV Knows
