Oxygen-demanding wastes: organic wastes which can be aerobically decomposed by bacteria DO (dissolved oxygen) - oxygen content BOD (biological oxygen demand) - amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic decomposers to break down the organic material in a certain volume of water over a 5-day period Inorganic plant nutrients: water-soluble nitrate and phosphate compounds that can cause excess growth of algae and aquatic vegetation Organic chemicals: oil, gasoline, plastics, pesticides, cleaning solvents, detergents and many other water-soluble and insoluble chemicals Sediment or suspended matter: insoluble particles of soil and other solid inorganic and organic materials Radioactive substances: radioisotopes that are water soluble or capable of being biologically amplified to higher concentrations as they pass through food chains and webs Heat: excess input of water that is heated - used mostly to cool electrical power plants Sources of pollution: Point: pollution discharged at specific locations through pipes, ditches, or sewers into bodies of surface waterNonpoint: big land areas that discharge pollutants into surface and underground waters Stream and river pollution - usually recover rapidly from heat and oxygen-demanding wastes due to flow - often not a major concern - cities get their drinking water upstream and discharge sewage downstream Lake pollution - less flow for dilution and mixing - stratification prevents mixing, resulting in excess nutrient loading - cultural eutrophication - input of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) accelerated by human activities Prevention methods: use advanced waste treatment to remove phosphates from effluents ban or set low limits on phosphates for detergents and cleaning products control land uses, use sound soil conservation practices protect coastal and inland wetlands that filter and retain nutrients Cleanup Methods: dredge bottom sediments to remove excess nutrients remove or harvest excess weedscontrol nuisance plants with herbicides and algicidespump air through lakes to avoid oxygen depletion Ocean pollution: the ultimate sink for much of the waste matter produced can dilute, disperse, and degrade large amounts of sewage, sludges, oil, and some types of industrial waste, especially in deep waters marine organisms tend to be more resilient to exposure about 2 million birds and 100,000 marine mammals die when they ingest or become entangled in plastic cups, bags, six-pack yolks, nets, ropes, and other forms of trash 80% dredge spoils - materials scraped from the bottoms of harbors and shipping channels 20% sewage sludges - mixture of toxic chemicals, infectious agents, and settled solids removed from wastewater at sewage treatment plants Oil pollution: most actually comes from waste oils disposed onto the lands by individuals, industries, and cities - tanker accidents and well blowouts most visible but account for only about 20% Groundwater pollution: most groundwater is renewed so slowly that any contamination may be considered permanent natural removal of bacteria and suspended solid particles as water percolates through soils into aquifers slow flow, cold temperatures, and lack of oxygen greatly extends time from wastes to degrade Preventing contamination may be the only effective way to protect groundwater by banning virtually all disposal of hazardous wastes in sanitary landfills and injection wells monitoring of existing landfills and wells for leakage placing stricter controls on chemical applications establishing national groundwater standards Controlling surface water pollution: Nonpoint source: primarily agricultural - reduce excess fertilizer and pesticide use, control feedlot runoff, reforest watersheds Point source: wastewater lagoons - large ponds where air, sunlight, and microorganisms can break down wastes septic systems primary sewage treatment - mechanical screening of debris such as sticks, stones, rags
