construction of large canal or flood control projects involving a lot of labor if we are looking at case in which they never built a canal bigger than a ditch that one family could dig, and never built any kind of flood-control system then there is simply no way that Wittfogel's theory could apply in practice, it is wise not to depend on a single contradiction because someone could always find a flaw in your argument or disagree with some interpretation or bit of evidence or find some bit of evidence that you didn't know about that seems to refute the evidence you are using but if you can find multiple flat-out contradictions, you have an even stronger case against the theory disproving a theory is frequently possible, but proving a theory in the social sciences is virtually impossible you could only prove a theory if you could run repeated experiments, control the variables, and see if the outcomes matched the predictions of the theory if the outcomes matched the predictions of the theory every time, we would consider the theory to be proved just like you can \"prove\" physical theories like \"momentum is conserved\" but we obviously cannot perform experiments in which we set non-civilized people up in certain situations and then watch to see if they develop civilization the most we can do is show that the theory is consistent with a lot of diverse evidence the case is strongest when the evidence seems hard to explain in any other way there are multiple, independent kinds of evidence that all are consistent with the theory this makes us think that it would be too much of a coincidence for all these things to be this way for some other reason that that provided by the theory the theory suggests specific, maybe unusual or counter-intuitive, kinds of evidence that don't seem likely to come about, but in fact turn out to be present then we feel that the theory has \"predicted\" something correctly and that the chance of this happening if the theory were not true is small none of these arguments actually proves the theory they just give us a greater or lesser degree of confidence in the theory that is, they make us think that the odds are more or less good that it is at least partially right that is the best we can ever hope for we can keep disproving the clearly incorrect theories, and throw them out the ones that stand up to repeated testing without getting disproved are likely to be closer to the truth and the ones that account for more evidence come to be seen as more convincing, and more likely to be true but we can never really prove
