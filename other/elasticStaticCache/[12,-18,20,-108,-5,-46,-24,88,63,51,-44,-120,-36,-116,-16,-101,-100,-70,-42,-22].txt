the brain and spinal cord to the organs and tissue of the body Ending : Point at which a nerve enters the structure it supplies and transmits or receives its impulse Motor : Supplies muscles and causes them to contract Parasympathetic : Nerve in the involuntary nervous system such as those supplying the lungs, heart, intestines, etc. Sensory : Nerve that travels toward the spinal cord or brain and transmits sensations such a touch, pain, heat, cold vision, hearing Neuritis Inflammation of the optic nerve supplying the eye Neurologist Physician who specializes in diseases of the
