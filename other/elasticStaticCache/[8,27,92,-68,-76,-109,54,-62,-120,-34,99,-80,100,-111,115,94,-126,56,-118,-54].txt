results from cycles of heating and cooling in rocks containing minerals with different expansion coefficient - differential expansion and contraction leads to varying volume increases setting up stresses that break rocks 15 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 4) ABRASION - mechanical wearing and grinding of rock surfaces by friction and impact - rocks fragments produced have more rounded appearance - associated with geologic processes that move rock fragments (rock fall, running water and wind) 16 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 5) ORGANIC (BIOLOGICAL) ACTIVITY -weathering as a by-product of life activities of organisms e.g. plants - roots widen cracks burrowing animals - actively break rock and bring material from depth, exposing it to chemical weathering at the surface human activities - construction, farming 17 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES SUMMARY Mechanical Weathering: 1) produces smaller pieces of rock 2) does not change the composition of the rock 3) adds to the effectiveness of chemical weathering 4) may lead to the formation of talus slopes 18 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals - reactions that alter the internal structure of minerals subtract and/or add elements, changing the composition of the rock 19 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING The Role of Water in Chemical Weathering - it takes part directly in most chemical reactions - it acts as a medium of exchange by introducing and transporting elements to the minerals - it removes the product of weathering to expose fresh rock surfaces for further weathering 20 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) SOLUTION ( Dissolution ) - rock material passes directly into solution by dissociation of the constituent ions in a liquid e.g. salt dissolving in water NaCl = Na+ + Cl- ** most minerals are slowly soluble in pure water, the presence of small amounts of acids increases solubility by providing excess hydrogen ion (H+) 21 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) SOLUTION ( Carbonation ) Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks e.g. H2O + CO2 = H2CO3 = H+ + HCO3 - and CaCO3 + H+ + HCO3- = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- - important action in limestone terrain where solution features lead to Karst Topography - responsible for hard water (Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) - some rocks can be completely dissolved and leached away, few outcrops exist except in deserts 22 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - reactions of minerals in rocks with oxygen to form oxides (hydroxides if water is present) - commonly occurs as rusting e.g. 4Fe + 3O2 = 2Fe2O3 (iron oxide or hematite) - oxidation of pyrite e.g. FeS2 + O2 + H2O = FeO(OH) + H2SO4 23 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - important in the alteration of Fe/Mg minerals (olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite) and mafic rocks (basalt and gabbro) where oxidation imparts a red color to altered basalt) - the production of acids from spoil banks (mine tailings) that are transported by runoff from rainfall into streams killing fish and making water unfit for drinking is of environmental concern 24 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 3) HYDROLYSIS -
