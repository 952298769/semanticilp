the magnifying glass, and the five senses to observe the physical environment arrange and classify objects according to attributes or properties communicate data orally and through simple graphs, pictures, written statements, and numbers measure length, mass, and volume using standard and nonstandard units make predictions based on patterns of observation rather than random guesses conduct simple experiments to answer questions Earth and Space Science Students: investigate and understand Earth s natural resources and how to protect them explain why air, water, and soil are natural resources describe ways to protect Earth s natural resources Students: develop an understanding of seasonal changes and cyclical patterns in nature, including temperature, precipitation, and cloud formation observe and communicate the day s weather orally and through graphic representations both on a daily basis and over a period of time use a thermometer as a tool to record the rise and fall of temperature&#9; observe and describe in general terms how a cloud is formed (water cycle) observe and describe the various states of water--solid, liquid, gas (ice, water, water vapor/steam) &#9; Life Science Students: use their senses to explore their surroundings and obtain different information from each sense work in groups to generate a visual organizer ( a web chart) showing how the senses can be used to describe the world around them observe plants and animals during seasonal changes gather and record data in a factual manner Students: investigate and understand that plants have life needs and functional parts and can be classified according to certain characteristics identify the characteristics of plants including edible or nonedible, flowering or nonflowering, evergreen or deciduous (trees that lose their leaves in the winter) identify the needs of a plant including, air, water, light, and a place to grow identify the various sources from which plants grow, including seeds, bulbs, and parts of plants grow plants from seed and identify plant structures ( roots, stems, leaves) and their functions describe methods by which seeds travel investigate and understand the life cycle of plants understand that plants are a natural resource and that they are important to all life Students: investigate and understand that animals have life needs and specific physical characteristics identify the characteristics of animals including whether they are wild or tame or live in water homes or land homes identify the needs of animals including air, food, water, and a suitable place to live identify that animals have physical characteristics such as body coverings (scales, skin, hair, feathers), body shapes, different number of appendages, and body movements observe and record observations of earthworms identify the basic body parts of an earthworm and the stages of the earthworm s life cycle including egg, hatchling, and adult investigate through \nexperimentation, observation, and data records an earthworm s reaction to different types of soil and light create an appropriate habitat for an earthworm using knowledge from investigations Students: investigate and understand that natural resources are limited identify the following as natural resources: plants and animals, water, air, land, minerals, forests, and soils describe how reducing, reusing, and recycling wastes can help save natural resources Physical Science Students: investigate and understand how different materials interact with water observe and describe the results of mixing liquids and some everyday solids such as baking soda, chalk, powdered drink mix, sugar, and salt;",0.5890806913375854]]
