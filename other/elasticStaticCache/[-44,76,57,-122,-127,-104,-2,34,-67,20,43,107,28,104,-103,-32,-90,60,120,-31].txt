[["I have had people tell me that there's infinite energy in a magnetic field. As \"proof\" they cite the refrigerator magnet clinging to the vertical wall of the refrigerator and supporting its own weight against the pull of gravity, presumably forever. Some add that it will only fall when the \"stored energy\" in the magnet is exhausted. So, they say, the magnet must have an unlimmited amount of energy stored in it. These people are slow learners. The magnet, at rest on the refrigerator wall, is doing no work, and is expending no energy, for its force of attraction causes no motion of the magnet or the refrigerator. The magnet does have some stored energy (from the work required to magnetize it), but it isn't using up any of that. Nor is it stealing any energy from gravity. It simply isn't expending energy in any form. Consider a similar situation. Use glue to fasten a block of wood to the the refrigerator wall. No magnetism is involved. The block will stay there, supporting its own weight, indefinitely. Would the person who used the magnet example now claim that the glue has unlimited energy stored in it? What about a nail driven in the wall to hang a picture? Or a closet coat-hook? Folks who still use the refrigerator magnet argument as an argument for extracting unlimited energy from magnets are committing not only an error of physics, but an error of critical thought and a singular lack of common-sense.",1.2179874181747437],["What forms of energy does electricity produce when being used to light up a lightbulb using only a D-cell battery, a flashlight bulb, a rubber band, sandpaper, and magnetic wire?",1.059446096420288],["What forms of energy does electricity produce when being used to light up a lightbulb using only a D-cell battery, a flashlight bulb, a rubber band, sandpaper, and magnetic wire?",1.059446096420288],["Also, when the unit is under sprung (under tuned), the magnetic energy developed by the coil assembly is not being used and is dissipated in the form of heat.",0.9343869686126709],["Also, when the unit is under sprung (under tuned), the magnetic energy developed by the coil assembly is not being used and is dissipated in the form of heat.",0.9343869686126709],["All these terms are efforts to express in somewhat inadequate words what happens when the higher energies are substituted for the lower, when the magnetic &quot;pull&quot; of the spiritual energies draws upward and absorbs the lower energies which are concerned primarily with the personality life, or when the reflecting light of the Spiritual Triad and of the Monadic Glory are transferred into the higher energy centers in the final vehicle used by the developed human being.",0.8555104732513428],["At what rate is magnetic energy being dissipated in the mantle?",0.8347110152244568],["Tegu blocks are the first magnetic wooden blocks on the market and are manufactured using Huesito, Mahogany, Beech, and Primavera woods.",0.8126765489578247],["The floor is the same as that used by the IRS and FTB when requiring Form 1099 magnetic media reporting.",0.8034271597862244],["To test whether the crater was indeed formed by collapse or not, we devised a test using measurement of the Earth's magnetic field across the crater floor.",0.7954396605491638],["Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts , kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics .

Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral ( magnetite ) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century.
