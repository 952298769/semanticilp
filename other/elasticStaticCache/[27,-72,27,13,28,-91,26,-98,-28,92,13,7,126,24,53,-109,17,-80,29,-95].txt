whereas rills are confined to slopes, gullies are part of the drainage network, that is, they shed and water and sediment form slopes and into higher order streams Mass wasting the downslope movement of earth materials in response to gravitational stress , where stress is force over area (kg m -2 ) shear stress the component of gravitational stress that is parallel to the slope and causes earth materials to move downslope normal stress the component of gravitational stress that is directed into (perpendicular to) the slope, and gives earth materials strength and resistance to erosion and mass wasting shear strength the resistance to shear stress as a function of the normal stress , cohesion, inter-particle friction, and porewater pressure factors that cause increased shear stress and potential for mass wasting undercutting of slopes: increases the slope angle loading of slopes ( e.g. water, snow or sediment): increases the weight of earth materials earthquakes or man-made vibrations: transient and instantaneous increase in stress regional tilting: increases slope angles over large areas factors that cause decreased shear strength excess soil moisture (porewater pressure): forces particles apart and thereby reduces friction weathering: reduces cohesion among grains and crystals inherent weakness: poorly consolidated soil and rock structural changes: progressive changes to soil and rock structure ( e.g ., the breaking apart of soil aggregates) types of mass wasting creep the slow imperceptible plastic deformation of soil and weak it is caused by the expansion and contraction of soil in response to wetting and drying or freeze and thawing, thus creep tends to be seasonal the soil expands away from the surface, but during the contraction phase it moves slightly downslope in response to gravity (shear stress) creep is common on grassland slopes where there are no tree roots to bind the soil together with a low sun angle, early or late in the day, terracettes (small terraces) are visible on prairie hillsides flow the internal shearing (fluid deformation) of earth materials the most rapid movements of soil and rock caused by excess porewater which lifts the earth materials and initiates the flow an earth flow extend across hillsides;",1.1254867315292358],["Apparently these were broken apart by water freezing in the cracks and
