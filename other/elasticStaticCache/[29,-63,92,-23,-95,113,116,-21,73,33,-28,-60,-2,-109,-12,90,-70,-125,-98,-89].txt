about a billion in luminosity Because of their number and common internal structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up main sequence Common type of star in our Galaxy is faint,

increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far
