SCIENCES (WATER) Concepts and Content: Water on earth moves between oceans and land forms through the process of evaporation and condensation BENCHMARKS As a basis for understanding this concept, students know: 3.1 most of the earth's water is present as salt water in the oceans, which cover most of the earth's surface 3.2 when liquid water evaporates, it turns into water vapor in the air and can reappear as a liquid when cooled, or as a solid if cooled below the freezing point of water 3.3 water moves in the air from one place to another in the form of clouds or fog, which are tiny droplets of water or ice, and falls to earth as rain, hail, sleet, or snow 3.4 the amount of fresh water, located in rivers, lakes, and underground sources, and glaciers, is limited, and its availability can be extended through recycling decreased use 3.5 the origin of water used by their local community Resources: Metropolitan Water District Teaching Kits - Admiral Splash (213)217-6926
