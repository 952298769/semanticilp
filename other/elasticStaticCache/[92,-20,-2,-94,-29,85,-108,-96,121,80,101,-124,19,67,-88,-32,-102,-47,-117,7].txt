[["SPB Key Points Scientific name Dendroctonus means \"tree killer\" Mass attacks by thousands of beetles kill vigorous pines Beetles disperse widely and reproduce rapidly Community-wide detection and suppression programs reduce beetle impact Benefits of community-wide suppression programs Reduced mortality of pine trees Reduced usage of protective insecticides Cost sharing encourages prompt control Cost sharing reduces the financial burden to individual property owners Life Cycle Eggs hatch in less than 1 week Larvae develop in 2 weeks Pupal stage lasts about 1 week Females may live 1 month and lay 160 eggs Behavior Females initiate attacks and produce aggregation pheromone Swarms of beetles can kill healthy pines Parents emerge in 1 week to disperse and infest additional pines Brood adults emerge in 4 to 6 weeks to disperse and infest new pines Signs of Attack Popcorn-like pitch tubes on trunk of loblolly pines, brown pitch-runs on slash and longleaf pines 1-mm-diam holes in bark Serpentine egg galleries through the inner bark Pine needles changing from dark green to light green, to yellow, to red, and then falling to the ground Woodpeckers debarking stems of green pines Epidemiological Factors of SPB Outbreaks Weather Insect Population Dynamics Forest Conditions Landscape Structure Three Levels of Infestation Tree Spot Forest Factors Affecting Rate of Spot Growth Tree resistance Beetle numbers Factors Affecting Tree Resistance Pine species Tree age, size, and growth rate Competition with other plants Weather Season of the year Trauma -- lightning, trenching, fire, thinning, etc. Factors Affecting SPB Attacks/Day Distance to, size, and age of surrounding infestations Tree and beetle-produced attractants Tree and beetle-produced repellents Weather Three Sources of Attacking Beetles Immigrant adults Reemerged parent adults Newly emerged brood adults Suppression Objective To reduce SPB populations such that the number of attacking beetles is unlikely to exceed a tree's ability to resist colonization SPB Control Options Cut and remove infested trees (Sanitation Salvage), then process logs to kill beetles Cut and spray trees with approved insecticide Cut and leave (Spot Disruption) - does not stop beetle dispersal Do nothing SPB Impact 1.",1.6251474618911743],["decreased thickness of growth rings in pine trees;",1.568820595741272],["Forest resources of the property include oak and pine trees.",1.401125431060791],["Pine tree is an important forest resource of China.",1.401125431060791]]
