How weathering is thought to affect ice ages: It lowers mountains and allows wind to circulate more freely It releases calcium that combines with carbon dioxide It removes sulfur that otherwise might warm the atmosphere It creates methane, which cools the atmosphere The earth's natural Greenhouse Effect is mostly due to Carbon dioxide Methane Sulfur dioxide Water vapor When ice-dammed lakes drain, they usually drain by evaporation by seepage into the ground by gradually lowering their outlets by abrupt failure of the ice dam The number of ice advances during the Pleistocene was most likely: one four 20-25 over 100 The best record for the Pleistocene ice advances is contained In deposits on land In the Antarctic ice cap On the sea floor In glacial lake deposits Marine evidence for ice
