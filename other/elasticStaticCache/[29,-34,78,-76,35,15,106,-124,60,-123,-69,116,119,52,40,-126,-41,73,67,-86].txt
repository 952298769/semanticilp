of landforms, including their history and processes of origin Landforms : configuration of the land surface taking distinctive forms and produced by natural processes Examples: hill, mountain, valley, plateau, floodplain, cliff, canyons ***Landforms are the surface expression of the lithosphere and owe their development to processes originating from both within and outside the earth s surface Two types of processes that are shaping Earth s surface: Internal (tectonics, volcanic and earthquake activity): INITIAL LANDFORMS Example: Mountains are formed by movement in the earth s crust (tilt fault, folds, volcanic activity ) External (weathering, erosion by running water, wind, waves): SEQUENTIAL LANDFORMS \nExample: Some plains are formed by erosion over long periods of time (streams or glaciers) while others are formed by accumulation of material deposited by water, glaciers, or wind Denudation : total action of all processes whereby the exposed rocks of the continents are worn down
