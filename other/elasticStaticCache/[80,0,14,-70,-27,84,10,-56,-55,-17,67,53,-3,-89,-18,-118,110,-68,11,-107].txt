Sometimes called potential difference Voltage Magnetism Use to generate electricity on a large scale The first magnets discovered by people were lodestone, which attracted iron Magnets can attract or repel each other, just like electrical charges Unlike charges, the same two magnets can be made to attract or repel each other Magnetism Magnetic effects are strongest at the ends of a magnet These
