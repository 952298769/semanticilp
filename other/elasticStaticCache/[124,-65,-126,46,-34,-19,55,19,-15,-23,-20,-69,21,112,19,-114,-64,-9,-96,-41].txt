the susceptibility of igneous rocks reflects the order of crystallization given in BRS: 1) rate of weathering corresponds to the minerals position on the BRS (olivine - first and quartz - last) 2) rocks are aggregates of minerals, rocks with minerals higher in the BRS weather first 4 Page 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS TYPES OF WEATHERING 1) Mechanical or Physical weathering - disintegration or fragmentation of rocks involving no change in the mineralogical composition of the rocks 2) Chemical Weathering - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals 5 Page 6 WEATHERING AND SOILS WEATHERING PROCESSES Mechanical Weathering - breaks rock into smaller fragments that retain the characteristics of the original rock - do not change the mineralogical composition of the rock - exposes more surface area (increases the surface area to volume ratio) of rock for subsequent chemical attack 6 Page 7 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) FROST ACTION - Frost wedging, Frost Heaving , Salt Wedging 2) UNLOADING - Sheeting 3) THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION 4) ABRASION 5) ORGANIC (BIOLOGICAL) ACTIVITY 7 Page 8 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging - Frost wedging results from alternate freezing and thawing of water in cracks within rocks - as water freezes, volume increases by 9% -expansion exerts a force that is great enough to break the rocks 8 Page 9 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Requirements 1) pre-existing cracks or voids in rocks 2) adequate moisture (water) 3) temperature rises and falls below the freezing point of water - common in temperate climates, and high mountains in tropical regions 9 Page 10 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Talus Slope - an accumulation of weathered angular rock fragments at the bottom of steep slopes in large piles - formed in areas where frost action occurs on steep slopes 10 Page 11 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES Frost Heaving - a layer of loose rock or soil is lifted by the expansion of freezing water e.g. lifting of highway pavement during winter 11 Page 12 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES Salt Wedging - the growth and expansion of salt crystals induce stresses that break rocks, common in coastal areas and deserts Requirements 1) existing cracks 2) salt water supply 3) warm temperature for salt crystallization 12 Page 13 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) UNLOADING Sheeting - rock expands as overburden is removed by erosion, the overlying pressure diminishes (pressure release mechanical weathering ) - the increase in volume accommodated by the development of cracks and fractures parallel to the ground surface - common in plutons 13 Page 14 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) UNLOADING Exfoliation - large concentric plates or shells split from the main rock mass like the layers of an onion - shells are usually 10-20cm and thicken with depth and are absent below depths of 50-100m - large rounded dome-like mass of rock result (exfoliation dome) e.g. Stone Mt.
