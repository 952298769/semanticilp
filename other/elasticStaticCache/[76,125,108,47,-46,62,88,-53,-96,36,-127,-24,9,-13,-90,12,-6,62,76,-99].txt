is a progression of energy from one point to another The wave does not move forward only the energy in it progresses Wave is almost friction free Properties of waves Wavelength: Distance from one crest to the next Period: Time taken for one wave to pass a fixed point Frequency: Number of waves per second that pass a fixed point Velocity: Speed with which the waves are moving past a fixed point Orbital motion The size of the orbit of the water particles increases with wavelength The orbit size decreases rapidly with depth Orbit size decreases to 1/23 of surface value at a depth equal to 1/2 of wavelength Only &quot;feel&quot; waves to a depth of 1/2 of their wavelength Classification of waves: according to the way they are formed or destroyed Major formation forces: Wind Atmospheric pressure Landslides or other earth movements Gravitational attraction =>Wind waves have the most energy in surface ocean Restoring forces : Try to flatten out the waves Surface tension for very small waves (&lt;0.6 inches) Gravity, for everything bigger Deep and shallow water waves Relationship between wavelength and water depth determines wave characteristics Deep water wave: water depth &gt;1/2 wavelength orbits die away above bottom Shallow water wave: water depth &lt;1/20 wavelength orbits are flattened at the bottom Transitional wave: water depth &gt;1/20 but &lt;1/2 wavelength Wave &quot;feels&quot; bottom Gravity and seismic waves have very long wavelengths are always shallow water waves regardless of ocean depth Wave velocity Deep water waves Velocity of wave energy through water determined by wavelength Longer waves move faster Use period as is easier to measure than length Speed (m/sec) = 1.56 x wave period Typical 8 second trade wind wave moves at 12.4 m/sec=28 mph Shallow water waves Velocity of wave is related to water depth Speed (m/sec) = 3.1 x square root (depth) Typical 20 minute seismic wave moves at 470 mph When a deep water wave moves into shallow water it slows down Trade wind wave (8 second) 28 mph in deep water in 1 metre deep water speed is 3.1 m/sec=7 mph Wind wave formation Wind attempts to &quot;stretch&quot; surface skin of ocean Surface tension: capillary wave Wind deflected upwards, adds energy to wave pushes it forward Low pressure behind wave contributes to forward motion Continued wind, wave period and height grow together Waves are peaked in areas of formation, rounded swell away from formation regions Wave progression Longest waves move away from storm fastest Form wave trains Leading waves &quot;excite&quot; still water ahead of wave train New waves forms behind wave train Wave train travels at half the speed of the individual waves within it Maximum development of wind waves is the result of 3 factors: Wind strength Wind duration Uninterrupted ength of ocean that wind blows over (Fetch The stronger the wind the longer the duration and fetch needed to fully develop the sea Rarely get fully developed seas for strongest winds Highest waves found around Antarctica, constant wind, uninterrupted ocean Wave steepness and dispersal from a storm Maximum wave height in open ocean is 1/7 of wavelength, higher waves get whitecaps In region of formation seas chaotic Waves sorted by wavelength and speed as move away from formation region Waves turn to swell as they move away from region of formation height to

approaches shore &quot;feels&quot; bottom at depth = 1/2 wavelength Wave energy packed into shallower depth, becomes peaked Wave slows, period is constant, wavelength decreases Bottom of wave slows even more as gets shallower, wave crest moves ahead of base of wave Wave breaks when wave height to water depth ~ 3:4 Types of wave breaks Type of wavebreak depends on bottom Plunging waves from steeply sloping bottoms Spilling wave from gentle slopes Abrupt slope change: water surges on to beach Wave refraction Wave approaching coast at an angle End of wave entering shallow water slows down, rest of wave continues at full speed Wave bends towards shore (towards the slowest end) Wave diffraction Waves passing through a small gap diffract New waves reform at a point in gap and radiate out Occurs in harbour entrances and between islands Radiated waves between island groups form interference patterns Polynesian navigators recognised interference patterns to indicate island chains beyond the horizon Internal waves There are waves below surface at regions of density gradient, e.g. pycnocline Waves can be large but travel slowly as density gradient is small compared with one at sea

widespread destruction Elastic Rebound Theory Rocks bend before they break along a fault Gradual bending Rupture and energy release (strength of rocks exceeded) Rebound (ground \"snaps\" back) Motion of fault termed slip First demonstrated on San Andreas During 50 years before 1906 earthquake: 3.2 meters of offset Break started near Golden Gate Bridge Final rupture extended 430 kilometers Maximum offset along fault was 6 meters Seismic Waves Seismic energy transmitted two ways Body waves => travel through the Earth Travel through a material like a sound wave P-waves (primary) Fastest speeds - arrive first at seismometer Travel through solid, liquid or gas Compressional motion (push-pull): move material compresses and expands as they propogate S-waves Slower than P-waves (about half as fast) Time between arrival of P-waves and S-waves => distance of earthquake Shear waves (side-to-side motion at 90 o to direction of travel) Travel only through solids (liquids lack shear strength) Jeffreys in 1926 realized that S-waves were not just slowed, but blocked by the core S-wave \"shadow\" at angles >105 o => liquid outer core Surface waves => travel along Earth's surface Love waves (back & forth) Rayleigh waves (round & round) Like ripples on surface of earth Produce rolling/swaying motion rather than jolt/shake of body waves Seismic velocities depend upon rock properties Density (waves slower through higher density) Elasticity (waves faster through more elastic stuff) Both increase with depth, but elasticity increases more quickly => velocities increase with depth Easier to think of waves as \"rays\" Consider tracing a ray's path through the Earth Systematic increase in velocity with depth causes rays to curve Ray encounters an interface (sudden change in seismic velocity): Reflection Refraction Conversion (P => S or S => P) Gradual increase in seismic velocity causes rays to bend Bending produces shadow zones P-wave shadow zone => 105 to 142 o , caused by refraction of P-waves passing from mantle into outer core S-wave shadow zone => 105 to 180 o , S-waves blocked by liquid outer core Waves named based upon the types of interfaces they've encountered before reaching the seismometer PP, SS => bounced off Earth's surface once PcP => bounced off core (c) PKP => travelled through outer core (K) PKIKP => travelled through outer core (K) and inner core (I) Earthquake Locations &amp; Mechanisms P-waves arrive before S-waves at seismometer (P-waves about 2x speed of S-waves) Time difference between arrivals => distance Time-distance graph allows location of earthquakes using three detectors Fault motion can be determined by examining surface break (when visible) Most earthquakes deep => no surface break Examine the nature of P-wave arrivals: compression or dilation (See Figure 18.13 in book) \"Beach balls\" show the fields of dilation/compression => fault type Magnitude Magnitude is a measure of size of earthquake Richter magnitude Developed in 1935 by Richter at CIT Quantitative measure of how much ground moved (amplitude) adjusted for distance Logarithmic scale (increase of 1 => 10-fold increase in amplitude)
