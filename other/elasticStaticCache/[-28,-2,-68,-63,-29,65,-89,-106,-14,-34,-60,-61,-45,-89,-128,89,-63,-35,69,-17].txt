Energy-sources, conversion, and work Organisms need energy to oppose the tendency for increasing entropy (randomness) and to do different types of work, such as: synthesis (making more ordered structures) mechanical concentration (concentrating molecules on one side of a membrane) electrical (generating a voltage over space) heat light (=bioluminescence) Some organisms obtain energy from inorganic sources and use that to generate nutritive molecules= autotrophs autotrophs which use light energy (sunlight) are called phototrophs Organisms that derive energy from organic compounds to generate nutritive molecules= heterotrophs heterotrophs utilize organic molecules produced by phototrophs Energy from sunlight is captured by phototrophs and converted to chemical energy energy in chemical bonds can be very stable, mobile, convertible Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process of capturing light energy and using it to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into sugars-storing that energy in
