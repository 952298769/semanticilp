student learning reinforce direct measures Formative assessments occur during the learning process for continuous improvements Summative assessments occur after the learning process for \nassessing outcomes Tests Direct Measures of Student Learning Commercial, norm-referenced, standardized exams summative assessment Examples ETS Academic Profile ACT Collegiate Assessment of Academic Proficiency College Basic Academic Subjects Examination ETS Tasks in Critical Thinking ETS Major Field Test Advantages Quickly adopted and implemented Objectively scored External validity Reference group comparison Disadvantages Results not useful for student or program evaluation Results susceptible to misinterpretation Reducing disadvantages Campus measurement experts review reliability and validity data and summarize pros/cons Faculty review all available instruments and choose test that best fits curriculum Choose tests that also provide criterion-referenced results Use multiple assessment methods Locally-developed exams summative assessment Examples Measure students course-specific knowledge Advantages Content and style customized for goals and objectives of institution, program, or curriculum Local grading by faculty for immediate feedback Results useful for student and program evaluation Disadvantages Costly in time and effort to develop and score May not provide external validity Reducing disadvantages Use campus measurement experts to construct and validate Use faculty consultants to develop and score Use outside experts to develop and score Oral exams summative assessment Examples Form of locally-developed exam for face-to-face dialogue with faculty Advantages Greater breadth and depth measurement of student achievement Nonverbal communication aids in answering Opportunities for assessment of student thinking and communication skills Disadvantages Requires more time to conduct because of one-on-one format Students may feel intimidated in face-to-face Decreased external validity Reducing disadvantages Standardize questions Establish non-threatening environment Record exams for evaluation Back to top of page Competency-Based Measures Direct Measures of Student Learning Performance Appraisals formative assessment of demonstration of acquired skills Examples Appraisals of students at work to measure job-related behaviors such as leadership and communications Advantages Go beyond paper/pencil tests and most other assessment techniques and instruments Are preferable for measuring generalization of learning to specific settings and situations Relevant to professional training programs with well-defined skill development Usually the most valid measure of skill development Disadvantages Ratings and grading more subjective than for standardized tests Costly for time required Sample of performance appraised may not be typical because of observers presence Reducing disadvantages Develop specific measurable criteria for appraising performance Provide training for appraisers Conduct appraisals in least obtrusive manner Cross validate results with other measures Consider using students and community volunteers as appraisers to reduce cost and faculty time Simulation formative assessment when performance appraisal not possible Examples Role-playing problem solving situations to approximate the results of performance appraisal Advantages Better means of evaluating student skill development than tests Flexible-some degree of simulation can be arranged for virtually any student skill Can be group-administered for many skills Excellent measure for increasing external and internal validity of skills assessment at minimal long-term costs Disadvantages Costly (like performance appraisals) for difficult skills Usually requires considerable planning and preparation More expensive than traditional testing options in the short run Reducing disadvantages Can often be standardized through use of computer programs Back to top of page External Reports Direct Measures of Student Learning External examiner formative assessment conducted by expert in field from similar program at another institution Examples For comprehensive senior projects, exhibitions, performances in the arts, etc. Advantages Increases external validity Feedback useful for both student and program evaluation Disadvantages Risk of bad fit between examiner s expertise and program outcomes Can be costly and time-consuming for large programs Reducing disadvantages Agree on assessment criteria beforehand Limit external examiner measure to program areas where external validity is most needed Indirect Measures of Student Learning Third party reports summative assessment using input from parents, faculty, employers, etc. Examples Interviews of stakeholders besides students and alumni Advantages Provide consumer input about college serving purposes Offer different perspectives Enable recognition and contact with undervalued stakeholders Can increase internal and external validity Disadvantages Lower response rates May cost more than expected for logistics of identifying individuals to contact Confidentiality must be addressed carefully for individuals information Reducing disadvantages Conduct face-to-face and phone interviews to increase validity Reduce variability in answers by explaining questions carefully Attain informed consent when information about individuals is requested Coordinate contacts with other campus organizations contacting same groups to increase response rates Back to top of page Other Direct &amp; Indirect Measures of Student Learning Direct Measures of Student Learning Behavioral observations formative assessment student actions in natural setting Examples Classroom observations by teachers Advantages Best measure of degree to which attitudes and values are put into action Catching students being themselves is most natural form of assessment Least intrusive assessment option purpose is to avoid any interference with typical student activities Disadvantages Risk of observer effect May encourage \"big brother\" perception of assessment or institution Inexperienced observers can produce unreliable, invalid results Reducing disadvantages Avoid socially or ethically sensitive behaviors initially Use electronic observers whenever possible for accurate, reliable permanent observation record Classroom research formative assessment techniques used by teachers Examples Any classroom techniques for getting student feedback and improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning Advantages Provides direct feedback to teachers enabling continuous improvement Is a multimethod approach to assessment Conveys interest in student learning Disadvantages Results based on small sample sizes difficult to generalize results Standardization and validation difficult Simple techniques could be misused by untrained faculty Reducing disadvantages Provide training and support to faculty Encourage development of techniques across classes for general education assessment Portfolios summative assessment student work samples Examples Collections of multiple student academic work samples compiled over time Advantages Can be used to view learning and development longitudinally, which is highly valid and useful Can measure multiple components of a curriculum at same time Avoids test anxiety Increases student participation in assessment process Disadvantages Costly for evaluator time and effort Establishing reliable and valid grading criteria is challenging May not provide for external validity Students will select their best work Reducing disadvantages Submit at end of capstone course Collect portfolios from a sample of students rather than all \nstudents Train and use a panel of raters for each project Take care to maintain validity Indirect Measures of Student Learning Archival records summative assessment using biographical, academic data from colleges or other institutions Examples Retention and transfer studies Length of time to degree Graduation and transfer rates Advantages Readily available Cost efficient Unobtrusive Useful for longitudinal studies Standard component of all assessment programs Disadvantages Individuals rights and confidentiality Considerable effort to determine what data are available in large institutions May discourage development of formative and/or direct measures of student learning Reducing disadvantages Conduct comprehensive campus review of existing assessment/evaluation efforts and data collection Be familiar with FERPA avoid personally identifiable data collection w/out permission Use archival records relevant to specific learning/development goals and objectives Back to top of page Self-Report Measures Indirect Measures of Student Learning Written surveys and questionnaires summative assessment Examples Direct Mailed Emailed Signed Anonymous Advantages Allow stakeholders to give feedback on institution Can cover many topics in small space Results easily understood Can provide access to groups difficult to contact Disadvantages Good surveys and questionnaires are more difficult to construct Volunteer samples are biased Mail surveys yield low response rate Require careful organization to facilitate data analysis Forced choice responses don t get at best information Reducing disadvantages Use carefully constructed instruments reviewed by survey experts Use open-ended as well as forced-choice items Follow up with nonrespondents in person or on phone Customize commercially prepared surveys and validate locally prepared surveys Pilot both the instruments and the reports to increase accuracy Interviews student reports of attitudes and behaviors in face-to-face dialogue Examples Exit Focus Groups Advantages Individualized responses Useful for exchanging sensitive information Immediate feedback Greater variety of items than surveys, questionnaires, or some direct measures of student learning Increases information gathered using surveys or questionnaires Disadvantages Require direct contact, which may be difficult to arrange May be intimidating to interviewees Results dependent on wording of items Time-consuming Reducing disadvantages Plan carefully with assistance from experts Select interviewers with no vested interest in the information gathered Train interviewers Interview random samples when all is not possible Use less than 12 participants in a group Match number of participants to possible response times so that everyone has opportunities to answer questions Conduct telephone interviews when face-to-face is not possible Pilot-test both interview questions and
