secondary growth Cell division occurs in regions around periphery Conducting tissues multiplied into cylindrical zone Enables increase in diameter of plant, allows for tree-like height Evolved

tough, drought-resistant, protective seed coat Also contains products of mature megagametophyte Adaptive importance Aids in dispersal Protects embryonic plant from drying out Protects embryo`s food

Pterophyta: The Ferns Most abundant group Include small, reduced aquatic ferns fig 26.6b Include tree ferns of great size fig 33.8 Temperate plants are herbaceous with rhizomes, fronds and roots Nearly all are homosporous with dominant sporophyte Sporophyte large and conspicuous More complex than gametophyte Nutritionally independent of gametophyte Comparison to moss Fern sporophyte more developed, independent and dominant Fern more complex \nwith vascular tissue, roots, stems and leaves Other Phyla of Seedless Plants Includes Psilophyta (whisk ferns), Lycophyta (club mosses), Sphenophyta (horsetails) Share many common features Form archegonia and antheridia Produce free-swimming sperm that require water for fertilization Comparable features of seed plants Have nonflagellated sperm None form archegonia, few form antheridia SEED PLANTS Evolution and Ecology Derived from single, common ancestor Five phyla Include angiosperms, flowering plants In only angiosperms are ovules completely enclosed by sporophyte tissue at pollination Other four phyla collectively termed gymnosperms Reproduction Male and female gametophytes develop within sporophyte Gametophyte completely dependent on sporophyte Immature male gametophytes called pollen grains Carried to female during pollination Germinates forming pollen tube with sperm cells No free water required for fertilization Advancement of seed Protects embryo Enhances dispersal Precludes need for water Gymnosperms Ovules are not completely enclosed by sporophyte tissue at pollination Include conifers, cycads, ginkgoes and gnetophytes fig 33.9 Name means \"naked seed\" Characteristics of diverse groups Motile sperm in cycads and ginkgo Some have archegonia, others don`t Conifers are most familiar group fig 33.9a Include pine, spruce, fir, hemlock and cypress Most have needle-like leaves Generally grow in moderately dry areas Cycads have short stems and palm-like leaves fig 33.9b Ginkgo has fan shaped leaves fig 33.9c Gnetophytes differ greatly from one another fig 33.9d The Pine Life Cycle fig 33.10 Life cycles of conifers similar Cycle usually complete in one growing season (pine takes two) Angiosperms Ovules enclosed by sporophytic tissue at pollination Structures called carpels fig 33.11 Pollination indirect Pollen grain reaches specialized portion called stigma Pollen tubes grow through style to ovary Ovary contains ovules, each contains an egg Pollination in gymnosperms is direct Ovules exposed to air (not enclosed) Pollen reaches ovule directly Carpel grows into characteristic fruit, encloses seeds Not directly evolved from living phyla of gymnosperms Angiosperm flower composed of four whorls fig 33.12 Innermost whorl collectively called gynoecium Carpels fold around ovules Stigma separated from body of carpel by style Pollen tube grows through stigma and style Reaches lower portion called ovary Separate or fused carpels called pistils Next whorl below is androecium Individuals called stamens Composed of filament plus anther fig 33.11 Anther contains four microsporangia or pollen sacs Microspore mother cells produce microspores Microspores develop into pollen grains Pollen shed at either two- or three-celled stage Mature microgametophytes have three cells Two are sperm cells Third is tube cell that grows into pollen tube Two outermost whorls called perianth Corolla, below stamens, is composed of petals Outermost calyx is composed of sepals Pollen carried by numerous animals Enhanced by various reward systems like nectar from nectaries Evolution of floral characteristics associated with pollination Some plants self-pollinate, exhibit inbreeding Four cells initially produced via meiosis Three disintegrate, on survives Meiosis occurs within nucellus which is enfolded by integuments Ovule = integuments + nucellus fig 33.11 Angiosperms exhibit unique process of double fertilization First sperm fuses with egg and forms zygote Second sperm fuses with polar nuclei Forms triploid primary endosperm nucleus Gives rise to nutritive endosperm fig 33.13 Developing embryos derive nutrition from endosperm Example: bean and pea Endosperm transfers to embryo when seed is mature Seedling leaves are swollen and fleshy, contain food reserves Example: corn Seed contains abundant endosperm Embryo draws on endosperm as it germinates Summary
