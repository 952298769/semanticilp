It begins with leaching by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for microbial colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous detritivore species. Following this, the plant detritus (consisting of cellulose , hemicellulose , microbial products, and lignin ) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their chemical structure . For instance, lignin is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain fungi , such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment. [15] Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of saproxylic insects may develop [16] and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor. [16] Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow. Warmth determines the speed of plant decay, with the rate of decay increasing as heat increases, i.e. a plant in a warm environment will decay over a shorter period of time. In most grassland ecosystems, natural damage from fire , insects that feed on decaying matter, termites , grazing mammals, and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and nutrient cycling , while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition.",1.3644578456878662],["Vegetation impacts soils in numerous ways.

Plants shade soils, keeping them cooler and slow evaporation of soil moisture, or conversely, by way of transpiration , plants can cause soils to lose moisture. Plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals and improve the soil structure. The type and amount of vegetation depends on climate, topography, soil characteristics, and biological factors. Soil factors such as density, depth, chemistry, pH, temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location. Dead plants and fallen leaves and stems begin their decomposition on the surface.
