has really gotten people talking... Age of Empires II Although the gist of Age of Empires II is basically the same as its predecessor, it feels like a whole new game... Black &amp; White Black & White is more of a strategy game than it is anything else, but it is so different from any other strategy game that it nearly defies categorization... Age of Empires: The Conquerors Expansion ...if you were to go to the store and actually buy an add-on, The Conquerors - and expansion set for Age of Empires II - would be a solid choice... Starcraft: Brood War Should you find yourself wanting more out of Starcraft, you will definitely want to consider the Brood War expansion... Caesar III Caesar II fans will probably find that there is not a tremendous improvement between this game and the previous Caesar game other \nthan new graphics and cutscenes... Civilization: Call to Power This is a good game and it's a true Civilization through and through... Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun -- Firestorm Firestorm is almost laughable, which must be rather disappointing for Tiberian Sun fans because the game has evolved into something that barely resembles the original Command & Conquer Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty \"The Dirty Half Dozen are back,\" although Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty is neither a sequel nor an add-on... Deadlock 2 There aren't many entertainment developers anymore who build turn-based games, as opposed to the latest craze of real-time strategy games... Dominion: Storm over Gift 3 Having seen Dominion in its early stages at 7th Level approximately two years ago, we knew the game showed a great deal of promise... Dune 2000 As it stands, Dune 2000 is a good game, but not a great game and it still needs to have a few bugs ironed out... Dungeon Keeper 2 It's the type of game that a player can sit down to for just a few minutes, but can become absolutely absorbed in just because it's not something that he or she has seen before... Myst III: Exile Myst III captures the best elements of its predecessors, including the intrigue, the fragility, and the beauty of the games' islands...

have not gotten a clock for my room i have mixed feelings about acquiring one but i have nothing schedule for this morning Tycho mailed me a color xerox picture of my head D-locked to the bottom of a bus at a Berlin action i stuck it up on my wall along with a poem she wrote about the real Heisenburg principals and i wonder a bit when i will be a full-time activist again i threw my wallet into a sticky drawer in my dresser we don t use money here my left pocket felt empty going thru bags and boxes for other pictures to decorate my new room (last night, i removed the puppy pictures on my wall the previous resident was 6) i found a key ring with a few keys i threw that in the sticky drawer another antique no locks here i thought i would weave hammocks for my first work since we do a lot of that here the shop was empty most people had taken the jigs outside to work in the sun but i wanted to listen to an old Bruce Cockburn CD from the large hammock shop library so i slipped one of the many headphones and did almost an hours work shuffling my feet to lovers in a dangerous time i e-mailed for the rest of my first official morning as a member not creditable, of course E. Europe & New England nuke stuff, fundraising, love letters, the usual i grabbed one of the many free bikes and pedal to lunch (basically the Am*dam white bike idea, only here it continues) there is fresh lettuce and strawberries from our garden (i had forgotten that strawberries actually do taste like something) i choose the cuscus with broccoli and black beans grab a glass of milk from our happy cows i leave the bread and tofu (both of which we make) behind Hawina and i sit in the sun at one of the half dozen picnic tables and eat we are surrounded by perhaps two dozen dinners ages 1 to 70 Sassafras, one of our youngest members, crawls up onto the table and seems vaguely interested in my strawberries she is so young, i think it is the color more than the taste which beckons i play hackisack for a couple of minutes before i split i have gotten much better since being here still in the low tier compared to most folx who play here but respectable enuf for me to feel okay jumping into the games which spark up perhaps every other sunny day i walk down to the courtyard, because my bike with a basket has disappeared and while there are others, i have bunch of papers to carry Deborah is teaching me labor assigning a complex, elegant and archaic art which manages to take the requests of almost 100 people the needs of all of the various business and households and fuse them together in a nearly all volunteer system we schedule community meetings and milk moves, the popular garden shifts and dreaded dishwashing there are requisitions for hot tub dates and pagan sing alongs, the team constructing the new warehouse pillow shop, rope production, sawmill, elderly care sewage treatment plant monitoring, school bus drivers, road cleans, health team mtgs, building maintenance, cooking, recycling, visitor orientations and dozens of other activities after 4 hours and a dozen notes we are finished (tho Deborah worked it for a dozen before i showed up) of the perhaps 300 assignments only one serf shift is unfilled (this is a kitchen or house cleaning) almost all volunteer i am amazed then i spend an hour teaching Deborah how to use a spreadsheet also creditable it does not matter that the motivating reason she wants to learn is so that she can sort songs and performers for the small library of songbooks which live in the compost caf our smokers lounge and live music hot spot we are in the caf when Kana shows up with pizza our cheese, our tomato sauce, crust from scratch and our former happy cows are ground up on top of it my vegetarianism is waning here Kana is a wild old man with a gray streaked father christmas beard \nhe spent some time in a monastery i would not be surprised if they threw him out for laughing too much now he is one of our regular cooks makes beautiful walking sticks, which Deborah and i sold at a fair and plays a mean guitar and sings with a gravelly voice never thought i would appreciate country music He has come down in one of the 3 or 4 golf carts we have for people who have trouble walking the long distances around here while he is delivering the pizza and chatting Calypso (one of our few dogs) eats most of his rice pudding which was in the gold cart there is some chiding and laughing At dinner small wooden signs mark the pizzas No dairy , No Onions , Meat and more i sit at the regular Thursday polyamory discussion (what i used to call open relationships ) the group has been over a dozen people but dinner did not get promoted this time so just four of us chat about the forming regional poly network and whether it will work on the issues and support or if it will be more for sparking new romances Melissa brings up group intimate agreements as she was part of at another community in NYC just as the conversation gets interesting we have to break up i have a 7 PM movement support meeting and i don t want to be late a video about the School of the Americas (SOA) is shown (the newest residence has a nice video hall, where there are movies and some taped tv shows show three nights a week there remains no live tv anywhere on the community one of the handful of prohibitions which has lasted 30 years) the short video is compelling and several communards were arrested at SOA last year there are plans to go again in November and to continue lobby work for the upcoming house vote we spend most of the meeting talking about which projects we will support with our few thousand dollar budget which is divided between supporting members activism and giving money to existing groups (tho the tax resistance protest we are involved with gives about $10,000 mostly from Twin Oaks resistors to non- profit groups but it is separate from movement support).",0.8269360065460205],["More than in any
