DRAFT April 10, 2014 118 B. Motivation / Presentation Show different types of magnets. Ask: _ Can you describe each of these magnets? _ what name is given to each type? _ What does a magnet do? C. Lesson Proper 1. Let the pupils do the activity in small groups composed of 5 members each. 2. Give the groups 10 minutes to read the procedure and do Activity 1 (Make it Move with a Magnet). 3. Ask a representative from each group to report their answers. Give him/her 2-3 minutes to report. Use an enlarged version of the chart to summarize the answer of each group on the board. 4. Discuss each question in the activity. Refer to the answers to questions/tasks in the background information. Let the group check their answers as you discuss the answers. If there are different results, let the pupils explain their answers to be able to identify where they made the mistakes or call a pupil from the concerned group to demonstrate what they did. 5. After answering question a, ask the pupils of the direction of the movement of paperclip. (They should be able to observe that the paperclip move in the same direction as their magnet). Recall that force can cause an object to move. The activity shows that the magnet exerts force on the paperclip. 6. For question b, the pupils should identify the objects that can be moved by a magnet. 7. For question c, they should observe that the objects that can be moved by the magnet are made iron, steel or other metal objects that contain these two. Those that did not move are non-metals like plastic, rubber and wood. If a paperclip that is made of pure plastic is available, show to the pupils that a plastic paperclip will not move when placed near a magnet. This shows that it is not the object but the kind of material that the object is made of that is attracted to a magnet. 8. The concepts developed in the activity are: _ Objects attracted to a magnet are made of iron and some metals. Not all metals are attracted to a magnet (e.g. aluminium, brass, copper). _ A magnet doesn’t necessarily have to be directly touching a magnetic object to affect it. It can attract a magnetic object at a distance. Assessment (The group’s output in the activity can serve as assessment.)

Lesson 2. Describing the Location of an Object After it has Moved Activity 1. Make it Move with a Magnet! Duration: 1 day Background Information A magnet is a solid object that has the ability to attract other magnets or magnetic objects. Magnetic objects are made up of iron and some other metals. Not all metals are attracted to a magnet (e.g. aluminium, copper, zinc, and brass). A magnet doesn’t have to get into contact with a touch a magnetic object to affect it. It can attract a magnetic object from a short distance. Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. describe how a magnet can move objects; and 2. identify materials that can be moved by magnets.
