Humans and other animals are called heterotrophs, which means \"other\" \"feeding\". Heterotrophs need to eat other organisms to survive. If you're a vegetarian, the organisms you are eating are plants. If you eat meat, the organisms you are eating are animals, and those animals probably ate plants, or ate other organisms that ate plants. For example, cows eat plants like grass and corn. Chickens eat plants and insects and worms. Those insects and worms got their food from plants, or from other insects and bacteria that ate plants. This is called a food chain, and it allows you to figure out the source of all your food. Write down a list of everything you ate for lunch and figure out where that food came from. (You may need to get help from your teacher to do this.) For example, if you had a hamburger and fries: the bread in the bun was made of flour, which comes from plants. The beef came from cows, which eat plants. The lettuce, onions and tomatoes came from plants. The fries are potatoes, which are plants. If you had a Coke with it, the sugar in the Coke came from plants. If you do this, you'll soon realize that the ultimate source of ALL food is plants. How can plants make their own food? They are able to use the energy in sunlight to make food from gas in the atmosphere and water and nutrients in the soil. This is a process called \"photosynthesis\", which means \"to make food\" \"from sunlight\". It's pretty amazing, when you think about it, but it means that plants cannot live without sunlight. So in this sense, humans and all heterotrophs need sunlight because we need plants for food and plants need sunlight. There are VERY few exceptions to this, and these animals live at the bottom of the ocean, or in other environments where there is no sunlight.",2.17870831489563],["(soil, air, water, sunlight) Pose the question, 'How do plants get what they need to survive?",2.108670949935913],["All plants need sunlight in order to survive .",2.1061577796936035],["All plants need sunlight in order to survive.",2.1061577796936035],["In order to survive, plants need air, water, sunlight, and soil to grow.",2.088268280029297],["In order to survive, plants need air, water, sunlight, and soil to grow.",2.088268280029297],["They need sunlight in order to survive.",2.0800821781158447],["What do animals need to survive?

All living things need food, water and air. Plants need “food”, the minerals and nutrients from the soil, energy from the sun and water. They also need the carbon dioxide from plants. Humans and animals need enough nutritious food, clean water to drink, comfortable and safe home, and unpolluted air to breathe. Note: 1. Breathing in plants can be explained as the exchange of gases. The plants give off oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide from animals and humans. Eating in plants can be explained as the absorption of minerals and nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun. Drinking in plants can be explained as the absorption of water from the soil and movement as the reaction of the plants to gravity, sunlight and wind. 2. a. Activities common to humans, animals and plants include breathing, eating, drinking, movement and living in a habitat. b. Humans, animals and plants breathe the same air. The air they breathe is from the environment. c. Humans, animals and plants do not eat the same food but they get the food from one source, the environment. d. Humans, animals and plants drink the same water but not from the same source. The water they drink is from the environment. e. Humans, animals and plants do not live in the same habitat. All of these habitats are found in the environment.
