by copulating throughout the menstrual cycle without external evidence of peak fertility periods to restrict sexual activity Both of these facilitate long-term pair bonding The Aquatic Ape Partly in response to &quot;Man the Hunter&quot; evolutionary scenarios, Elaine Morgan proposed that hominid evolution was primarily a female phenomenon She says that several female characteristics such as higher body fat levels and less body hair came along with standing bipedally in the surf off East Africa In this model, males splash along behind Walking efficiency Human bipedal running is both slower and less energetically efficient for running than is chimpanzee knuckle-walking However, for normal walking locomotion, for instance from one food source to another, human bipedal walking is more energetically efficient than is chimpanzee knuckle-walking Energy Efficiency Walking speed Species Energy cost ml 02/kg/hr Energy cost relative to quadruped 2.9 km/hr Chimp 0.522 149% Human 0.193 86% 4.5 km/hr Chimp 0.426 148% Human 0.170 94% 2.9 km/hr is normal knuckle-walking speed of chimps, 4.5 km/hr is normal bipedal walking speed of humans (Rodman and McHenry 1980) Bipedalism would confer an adaptive advantage especially in times of low food availability and sparse distribution of food resources Bipedal humans would expend less energy to move from patch to patch of food, and would get there faster on average than knuckle-walking early pongids In a changing environment such as that found at the close of the Miocene, food resources became more sparsely distributed as forests shrank and expanded The ability to move from one forest patch to another efficiently would have been adaptive Bipedal hominids would have been well suited to do this Last Modified: 05/18/01 e-mail me at: jbindon@tenhoor.as.ua.edu",0.8757680654525757],["Given that most of the body s changes appear to be physiologic adaptations to its new environment, perhaps a period of reconditioning before returning to Earth-normal gravity would be better tolerated, more natural .",0.8526292443275452],["If more radiation fell upon the Earth and the amount reflected didn't change the Earth would become warmer.",0.8402235507965088],["As the weather gets warmer, the diameter of body hair increases.",0.7886531352996826],["Most vertebrates would have difficulty living in gravel that is constantly stirred by tidal action, but the flexibility of the bodies of \"Luciogobius\" is likely an adaptation to this environment.",0.7790325880050659],["Bristling fur as a response to cold keeps the animal warmer by increasing the amount of air between hairs, which traps body heat.",0.7719674706459045],["The amount of precipitation on extreme wet (or snowy) days most likely would increase, but changes in the lengths of wet or dry spells are not clear.",0.7668473720550537],["Adaptation is the notion of organisms responding to a changing environments by evolving either a form or function of the body that would better suite it in the environment.",0.7501245737075806],["Adaptation is the notion of organisms responding to a changing environments by evolving either a form or function of the body that would better suite it in the environment.",0.7501245737075806],["Hair may become drier.",0.7449747920036316],["For FTM's the most visible change will be the increase of body hair and especially facial hair.",0.735399603843689]]
