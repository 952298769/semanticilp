lacewing's favorite foods, the eggs are placed singly on stalks brown lacewings are similar in appearance but are smaller and are tan to brown (different family) antlions look like damselflies but have longer antennae with knobbed ends, larvae live at the bottom of conical pits in dust or sand aquatic types: alderflies look like blackish or grayish lacewings, larvae are aquatic and have a single median terminal filament and 7 pairs of lateral filaments dobsonflies and fishflies have aquatic larvae which are usually found under stones dobsonflies are quite large with enlarged mandibles in the adult, larvae are called hellgrammites and are used for fish bait fishflies are smaller both of these larvae have 8 pairs of lateral filaments and no median caudal filament Order Coleoptera -

beetles weevils (=snout beetles) alfalfa weevil imported larvae damage stems then leaf buds, skeletonize leaves so field appears frosted, grayish or white stunts growth, reduces hay yield and quality bark beetles - elm bark beetle vectors Dutch elm disease white grubs are important in turf some eat stored foods and grains darkling beetles - flour and stored grains flour beetles many are predatory tiger beetles carabid larvae and adults ladybird beetles - eat aphids, scales, mites Order Mecoptera - scorpionflies small to medium sized 4 membranous long wings with many cross veins and often
