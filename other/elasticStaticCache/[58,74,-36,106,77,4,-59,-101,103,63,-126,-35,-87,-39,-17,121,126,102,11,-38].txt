For example, some species are partial migrants, with some individuals in a population migrating and others being sedentary. Other species exhibit differential migration, with differences among individuals in migration patterns based on age or sex. Still other species exhibit leap-frog migration, with populations or subspecies breeding at higher latitudes wintering further south (i.e., ‘leap-frogging’) than those breeding at lower latitudes (Figures 2 and 3).
