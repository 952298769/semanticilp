Water evaporates from everything that is wet. Clothes drying on the line, a swimming pool, puddles after a rainshower, a steamy bathroom after your shower, all of these are sources of water for evaporation. Perhaps the easiest way to observe water evaporation is to boil water in a pan or tea kettle and watch the process. It should be stressed with students that most normal processes of evaporation are not readily observable; there may be evaporation going on in the room around them at the very moment they are talking about it, but normally they will not see anything. They will however see the results: a saucer of water which has dried up after being left out for some time, or the drying of their skin as they calm down to a cooler temperature after running around the track for gym on a hot day.",0.5807032585144043],["This indicates greater evaporation of rainwater within the downdraft air.",0.5671797394752502],["6 The reduction of evaporation also reduces the capacity of the soil to store rainwater, thereby provoking flooding after rain events and other potential impacts on fisheries.",0.5604773759841919],["Pan evaporation was 150 cm;",0.5503942966461182]]
