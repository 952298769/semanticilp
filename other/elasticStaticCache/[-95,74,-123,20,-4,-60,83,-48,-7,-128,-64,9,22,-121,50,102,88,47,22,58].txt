increasing entropy (randomness) and to do different types of work, such as: synthesis (making more ordered structures) mechanical concentration (concentrating molecules on one side of a membrane) electrical (generating a voltage over space) heat light (=bioluminescence) Some organisms obtain energy from inorganic sources and use that to generate nutritive molecules= autotrophs autotrophs which use light energy (sunlight) are called phototrophs Organisms that derive energy from organic compounds to generate nutritive molecules= heterotrophs heterotrophs utilize organic molecules produced by phototrophs Energy from sunlight is captured by phototrophs and converted to chemical energy energy in chemical bonds can be very stable, mobile, convertible Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process of capturing light energy and using it to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into sugars-storing that energy in the chemical bonds of the sugars 1771-Joseph Priestly-discovered that plants could replenish

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Class of reactions that pass electrons from one molecule to another Oxidation: atom or molecule loses an electron, becomes oxidized Oxygen strongly attracts electrons Oxygen is most common electron acceptor in biological systems Reduction: atom or molecule gains an electron and is reduced Reactions occur together, electron transfers from one atom to other fig 8.3 Reactions play key role in flow of energy through biological systems Light adds energy and boosts electron to higher energy level Transfer of electrons often accompanied by transfer of protons Hydrogen atom: proton plus electron Oxidation involves removal of hydrogen atoms Reduction involves addition of hydrogen atoms Example: redox reaction of photosynthesis Hydrogen atoms transferred from water to carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide reduced to form glucose One mole of glucose stores 686 kcal of energy Example: redox reaction of cellular respiration Hydrogen atoms transferred from glucose to
