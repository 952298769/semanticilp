PHYSICAL SCIENCE Students will identify the properties of objects and materials Sort objects using observable properties such as color, shape, texture, temperature, size, smell, and weight Investigate methods for weighing and measuring objects using standard units of measure Contrast two states of water Students will explore the position and motion of objects Explore how pushes and pulls will change the movement of an object (examples: position, speed, and direction) Demonstrate that movement can have different speeds (slow, fast) Manipulate moving objects (vibration) in order to produce different sounds Students will explore characteristics of light, heat, and magnetism Investigate sources of light and heat Explore light and shadows and how shadows change at different times of the day C. LIFE SCIENCE Students will identify the characteristics of organisms Investigate living and nonliving things and compare their attributes Contrast characteristics of animal behaviors (how they eat, move, communicate, and reproduce) Investigate how animals, including people, use their senses to learn about the world Students will understand that organisms have life cycles Grow plants and observe all stages of the life cycle Explain how animals start out as babies, grow into adults, and eventually die Students will study how organisms survive in their environments Compare how the needs of students are similar to the needs of plants and animals D. EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Students will identify the properties of earth materials Compare different land forms and bodies of water around the school and community Observe and describe a variety of rocks by their physical properties Students will identify objects in the sky Investigate the sun as the source of light and heat Illustrate types of objects seen in the sky during the day and night Students will describe changes in Earth and sky Record daily weather changes in the local environment (examples: sunny, rainy, fog, snow) Give examples of how weather affects the lives of living things Observe and describe seasonal patterns Find examples of moving air E. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Students will identify simple technologies Investigate simple technology used in the classroom and home and describe how they help students Students will demonstrate appropriate grade level ability in technology design Design a simple device for moving an object and use the device for transporting the object F. SCIENCE IN PERSONAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES Students will practice safety \nDemonstrate personal and group safety when engaging in science activities Students will describe characteristics and changes in population Identify different populations within the school, community, human groups, animals, and insects Keep a record of changes in the classroom or outside areas of the school over a period of time (examples: plant growth, animals, birds, snails) Students will identify types of resources Demonstrate wise use of limited classroom materials, supplies, and time Determine that resources can be extended through recycling and conservation Students will describe how environments change Observe and describe changes in the classroom environment Practice ways to improve the environment G.
