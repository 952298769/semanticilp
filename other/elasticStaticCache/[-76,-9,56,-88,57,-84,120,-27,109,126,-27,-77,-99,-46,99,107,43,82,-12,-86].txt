Objective At the end of the lesson the pupils should be able to classify solids according to texture. Materials The objects to be observed will depend on the contents of the pupils’ bags. You can include objects like pad paper, sand, pebbles, sandpaper, pineapple peelings, wooden stick, sponge, drinking glass and others. Procedure A.
