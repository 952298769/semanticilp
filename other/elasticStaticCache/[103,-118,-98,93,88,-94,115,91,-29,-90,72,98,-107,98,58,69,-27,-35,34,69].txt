the lens Image distance: the distance of the image from the lens Lateral magnification: the ratio of the image height to the object height Aberrations: the failure of a lens to give a perfect image Dispersion: the spreading of light because of the wavelength dependence of the index of refraction Near point: the shortest distance from the unaided eye that produces a distinct (focused) image on the retina Far point: the greatest distance from the unaided eye that produces a distinct (focused) image on the retina Astigmatism: unevenness in the focusing of the eye Diopter: the unit of power
