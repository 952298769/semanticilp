involved in the mechanism of xylem transport Outline the steps involved in the mechanism of phloem transport Discussion questions Why must large plants have vascular tissues?",1.6449611186981201],["X1014014701-00136-27619</DOCNO> Lect18 Hall Cushman - BIOL 121 Lecture 18 - Plant Structure &amp; Growth II Announcements * assigned reading: Chap 31, pg 668-689 * remember: lab exercises will be on exam * study questions Introduction * 2 kinds of plant growth - primary growth = lengthening of shoots and roots - secondary growth = thickening of shoots and roots * primary growth results from cell division at apical meristems - protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium * secondary growth results from cell division at lateral meristems - vascular and cork cambium * growth in most monocots and some herbaceous dicots ceases with maturation of primary tissue - i.e. they completely lack secondary growth * growth of gymnosperms and woody dicots continues even after stem and root elongation ceases - i.e. roots and stems increase both in length (primary growth) and diameter (secondary growth) Vascular Tissues * vascular tissues - responsible for distributing substances throughout plant body - 2 kinds: xylem and phloem * xylem: transports water and dissolved minerals and provides plant with structural support - 2 kinds of water-conducting cells: vessel members and tracheids - both are elongate cells and dead at maturity - cells stacked end-to-end to form long, continuous tubes - water flows between adjacent cells through small holes in end walls - can be produced from primary tissue and secondary tissue (vascular cambium) * phloem - transports sugars (products of photosynthesis) and other solutes - comprised of living cells: sieve-tube members - cells stacked end-to-end as with xylem - adjacent cells interconnected by cell-wall perforations - can be produced from primary tissue (procambium) and secondary tissue (vascular cambium) - sieve tube members pick up sugars from photosynthetic cells (often with help of companion cells) and distribute them to growing and/or storage regions * vascular bundles - grouping of xylem and phloem into multi-stranded cords - phloem positioned near side facing outward - xylem positioned near side facing inside * vascular systems of monocots versus dicots (Figure 31.18) * location of ground-tissue regions relative to vascular tissue - pith: ground tissue occurring in center of stems and roots, inside of the vascular tissue - cortex: ground tissue occurring between vascular tissue and epidermis * 2 kinds of vascular organization in gymnosperms and dicots - vascular tissues develop as + continuous hollow cylinder within ground tissue - vascular tissues develop as a ring of discrete bundles separated from one another by ground tissue Vascular Cambium * 1 of 2 kinds of secondary meristem * results in production of secondary vascular tissue * meristematic cells of vascular cambium (a ring of undifferentiated cells) - cells become xylem if they divide off toward inner portion of root or stem (pushed inward) - cells become phloem if they divide off toward outer portion of root or stem (pushed outward) * vascular cambium increases in circumference as roots and stems grow - as it produces more cells via mitosis, greater numbers of xylem cells in root or stem center push vascular cambium outward - greater amounts of vascular cambium must be produced to allow for increased circumference * in most cases, much more secondary xylem is produced each year than secondary phloem - thin-walled primary phloem is eventually crushed by secondary growth Wood * secondary xylem = wood * hardwoods (dicots) and softwoods (gymnosperms) * conifer wood is much simpler in structure than for dicots - lacks vessel members;",1.63671875],["[ More about Animal Cells ] [ More about Plant Cells ] [ Chloroplasts ] [ Mitochondria ] [ Virtual microscope: xylem and phloem ] [ Mitosis ] [
