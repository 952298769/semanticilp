[["Explanation: Light from the sun is made up of a mixture of many different colors of light, even though to the eye the light looks almost white. A prism can be used to separate white light into the colors that make it up. Color is how we perceive the energy of light. All the colors of the rainbow are light of different energies. Red light has the lowest energy and violet light has the highest energy. An object appears red because the red light waves are reflected. This means that all the other colors are absorbed. Similar to a color filter. A red filter over a flashlight lens allows only the red light wave to pass through and absorbs all the other colors. White is a reflection of all the colors and black is the absence of color, so all the colors are being absorbed. This is why a white shirt feels cooler on a hot summer day than a black shirt.",1.8945151567459106],["I haven't shaved and I'm wearing a red plaid flannel shirt, no tie, on a hot sunny day in
