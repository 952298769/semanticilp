In this mating system, female guppies prefer to mate with males with more orange body coloration.

[16] Orange fruits are a rare treat that fall into streams where the guppies live. The ability to find these fruits quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context.

Most animals that live in the arctic snow are white. Being white helps them blend in with the snow and hide from predators. An example of a physiological adaptation that increases the likelihood of survival is the kangaroo rat's metabolism. Kangaroo rats live in the desert of the North American Southwest. It is extremely hot and dry there, and very little water is available. The kangaroo rat never needs to drink water because its metabolism has changed and adapted to conserve water; it gets all the water it needs from seeds it eats. Humans are the opposite; we must drink water daily because our metabolism uses lots of water. An example of a behavioral adaptation that increases reproduction is the croaking and calling of male frogs, which gets female frogs to come to the males for mating. Those frogs that call end up mating with more females and have more offspring than frogs that do not call.",1.4071542024612427],["Adaptive coloration in animals.",1.4045250415802002],["Insects have adaptations (specialized body parts, colorations) to help them find food, escape danger, communicate or find a mate.",1.3680084943771362],["Insects have adaptations (specialized body parts, colorations) to help them find food, escape danger, communicate or find a mate.",1.3680084943771362],["(Endler 1983, 173–190) We may refer to this pattern of coloration as a complex adaptation that serves the functions of predator avoidance and mate attraction.",1.3603038787841797],["3)  In most animal species, albinos look abnormal and are often rejected by others of the same species.  It may be picked on until it dies or until it leaves the group to live alone.  In the wild, an albino is much less likely to find a mate and have offspring.  Male animals tend to be more colorful than females of the same kind.  The male often uses his coloration to attract a female.  Lacking the necessary coloration, albino males cannot beat out the competition.",1.3369743824005127]]
