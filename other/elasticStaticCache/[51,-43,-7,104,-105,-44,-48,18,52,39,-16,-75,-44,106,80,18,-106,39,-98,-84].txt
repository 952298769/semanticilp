Analyze physical patterns in terms of the processes that created them, as exemplified by being able to Construct and analyze climate graphs for selected places and suggest reasons for similarities and differences in climates Compare regions of the world with similar physical features (e.g., desert regions in Nevada and western China, subarctic regions in Russia and Canada) Use appropriate maps to generalize about the relationships between physical processes (e.g., the relationships between ocean currents, prevailing winds, and atmospheric pressure cells) C.
