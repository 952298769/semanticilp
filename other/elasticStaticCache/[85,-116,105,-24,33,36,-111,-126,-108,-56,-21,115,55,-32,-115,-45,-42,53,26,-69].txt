Much has been said about the poor state in which these foxes live. Indeed, a quick Internet search will bring up as many fur farmers extolling the quality of the living arrangements of their animals as animal welfare websites describing soiled battery conditions. One thing is for sure: much work has been done -- and still continues -- to establish how to improve the living environment (both in terms of the impact it has on the fox’s physical health and its ‘emotional’ well-being) for the animals and we have learnt much about fox behaviour and biology in the process. During 1980s the anti-fur movement became organised and their campaigns are considered partly responsible for a decline in the popularity of fur during the 1990s. However, Wallen, -- who appears generally anti-fur farming based on the tone of his book -- makes an interesting point that boycotts of fur by animal rights often overlook the impact this can have on indigenous communities, which are often heavily reliant upon the revenue generated from the trapping. It is certainly a complicated and contentious issue and I should point out that the foregoing does not mean that I endorse the farming of animals for their fur.

Environmental accidents can be kept to a minimum under these conditions, and survival is almost complete during the major part of the life span. In all known cases, however, the early stages of the life span are characterized by a noticeable contribution of the selection–acclimation pattern.
