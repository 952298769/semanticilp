[["When a dog gets hot, it opens its mouth and lets its tongue hang out of it.",2.0612635612487793],["Hello Archskeptic, A dog?s tongue is not the only body part that helps dissipate heat: you may be surprised to lean the spleen is plays a role! ?Environmental scientists call dogs and humans homeotherms because they can maintain constant body temperatures, even in the face of extreme outside temperatures. Snakes and lizards' body temperature changes with the outside temperature - they are called poikilotherms. In people, normal body temperature is approximately 98.6_ F. While this temperature varies during the day; it stays relatively constant, regardless of whether it is 50_ or 90_ outside. The body's regulates temperature in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This brain center has several sensors that are critical for temperature regulation. In humans, the most important center for controlling heat is the sweating center. This center, which stimulates the sweat glands to release sweat, is less important in dogs. Each gram of sweat that evaporates gets rid of half a calorie of heat. In dogs, the panting center, which stimulates panting, helps the animal get rid of heat. Panting involves rapid shallow breathing that causes evaporation of fluid on the tongue. Dogs have a rich blood supply in their tongues. Heat produced in the dog's muscles and tissues enter the blood and is transported to the tongue, where it is eliminated through panting. The blood stream is critically important for regulating temperature in both dogs and humans. Water is the most plentiful substance in our bodies. Water is important for temperature control because it can hold a lot of heat; it can also carry heat to the surface via the blood stream. The spleen is a blood storage organ that helps control heat, particularly during physical activity. When you or your dog exercise, the spleen contracts, releasing blood into the blood stream. This blood is then available to help carry excess heat to the surface. Relative to body size, dogs have larger spleens than humans do. The relatively greater release of blood from the spleen during exercise is one reason why dogs usually have better endurance than people.? http://k9power.com/don'tget.htm Even though dogs have sweat glands in their feet and ears, they are not very efficient, and play a small role in thermoregulation. A dog?s fur protects not only against cold, but heat too! ?A dog's skin is made up of the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is an outer layer of cells that constantly gets replaced. The dermis is found under the epidermis and supplies it with nerves and blood. Sweat glands are found in the dermis along with sebaceous glands which feed oil into hair follicles in the epidermis to lubricate the skin. Hair grows up through follicles from papillae in the lower epidermis. More than one hair grows through the same follicle in dogs and one hair from each follicle, the guard hair, is usually longer than the others. Dogs can achieve piloerection, raising of the guard hairs, by contracting or lengthening muscle fibers in the dermis (Whitehead et al. 1999). A dog's fur insulates it against cold and heat (Johnson 1977) with the degree of insulation increasing with fur thickness (Schmidt-Nielson 1997). Dogs normally shed twice a year, in the spring and in the autumn. Shedding in the spring gets rid of hair that is not needed for the summer and shedding in the autumn is in preparation for growing a thicker coat for the winter.? http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/anphys/2000/Hatfield/Hatfield3.htm This site begins by discussing the opposite, heat maintenance, but moves onto heat dissipation in dogs: ?Anyone who has dealt with dogs knows that the dog pants when he is hot. It is his panting mechanism that allows the dog to lose heat he does not need when the weather is hot. The mechanism functions on the principle of evaporation. As I have said before, evaporation is extremely effective because you can lose almost five-hundred and forty times as much heat without changing the temperature of the air at all. This evaporation takes place in the dog's nose and is enhanced by the fact that there are many folds of tissue in the nose which increase the surface area that the air is in contact with. In addition, this tissue actually perspires and has a large blood supply, thereby acting much like the radiator in the car. This makes a good mechanism of heat loss, but one needs some way in which to shut it off when one does not want to lose heat. Since the animal must breathe and must take in a pretty constant volume of air at all times, because varying this volume of air would interfere with other bodily functions, people have often been concerned as to how this is controlled. A recent study, just published, has looked into this problem and has come to this conclusion. The air is brought in through the dog's nose and in the case of panting is exhaled through the mouth. In doing this, the air picks up much moisture and heat from the nose, this cooling the nose and drying it. When it is exhaled, it is exhaled through the mouth and since there is much less blood supply to the area around the mouth and the surface area is much less, almost all of the moisture is absorbed and the heat will leave the dog's mouth and be lost. When the dog does not wish to lose body heat, he simply exhales the air that he has brought in through the nose back out the nose, in which case a great proportion of the moisture and heat will be returned to the large surface area and the membranes in the nose thus minimizing the loss of heat. Therefore, when an animal is hot, the hotter the animal is the more of the air he brings in through his nose will be exhaled through the mouth, thus the wide open, tongue out position. If he does not wish to lose heat when it is cold out, he will breathe in and out through his nose and keep his mouth closed. The provides a quite sensitive means of temperature control, particularly in the case of the animal who has other means of protecting himself from the cold and from the outside temperature as do the long-haired Northern breeds. The animal, therefore, in general has developed enough capacity of heat loss through his panting mechanism to compensate for the very wide swings in temperature.? http://www.samoyed.org/heat.html ?Major changes in body fluids and tissues associated with over heating is known as Hyperthermin. This condition may be influenced by the dog?s muscular exertion, physical condition, hair coat, and surrounding factors like relative humidity and ventilation. The severity and duration of hyperthermia is influenced by 3 separate but often interrelated syndromes. http://www.webheads.co.uk/sleddog/ezine/pdf/Heat_Stress.pdf ?A special circulatory adaptation called countercurrent heat exchange enables both species to maintain the appropriate body temperature in their extremities. Countercurrent heat exchange is only one of many clever adaptations mammals have to help them to deal with variable temperatures. All mammals are endothermic: they maintain and regulate their own body temperature. Living in widespread environments around the world, mammals face daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperatures and some--for example those living in harsh arctic or tropical habitats--face extreme cold or heat. To maintain their correct body temperature, mammals must be able to produce and conserve body heat in colder temperatures as well as dissipate excess body heat in warmer temperatures.? Please see this site (and all the others posted) for more information. http://animals.about.com/cs/mammals/a/aa061601a.htm Do humans count as another species? ??the temperature of warm-blooded animals is maintained with but slight variation. In health under normal conditions the temperature of man varies between 36 _C and 38 _C, or if the thermometer be placed in the axilla, between 36.25 _C and 37.5 _C In the mouth the reading would be from 0.25 _C to 1.5 _C higher than this; and in the rectum some 0.9 _C higher still. The temperature of infants and young children has a much greater range than this, and is susceptible of wide divergencies from comparatively slight causes. Of the lower warm-blooded animals, there are some that appear to be cold-blooded at birth. Kittens, rabbits and puppies, if removed from their surroundings shortly after birth, lose their body heat until their temperature has fallen to within a few degrees of that of the surrounding air. But such animals are at birth blind, helpless and in some cases naked. Animals who are born when in a condition of greater development can maintain their temperature fairly constant. In strong, healthy infants a day or two old the temperature rises slightly, but in that of weakly, ill-developed children it either remains stationary or falls. The cause of the variable temperature in infants and young immature animals is the imperfect development of the nervous regulating mechanism.? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation#Variations_in_the_temperature_of_man_and_some_other_animals http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation#Variations_in_the_temperature_of_man_and_some_other_animals Dogs CAN suffer from hyperthermia: ?Heatstroke occurs when normal body mechanisms cannot keep the body's temperature in a safe range. Animals do not have efficient cooling systems (like humans who sweat) and get overheated easily. A dog with moderate heatstroke (body temperature from 104_ to 106_F) can recover within an hour if given prompt first aid and veterinary care (normal body temperature is 100-102.5_F). Severe heatstroke (body temperature over 106_F) can be deadly and immediate veterinary assistance is needed.? http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid=1683 ?Some causes of hyperthermia include exercise, being left in a parked car, a thick coat, short faces (such as with bulldogs and boxers), inadequate outdoor shelter, prolonged seizures, lung and heart diseases and a history of having hyperthermal episodes. Dogs have few ways to eliminate heat. When they pant, the tongue surface enlarges in order to dissipate as much heat as possible. Dogs sweat on the pads of their feet. http://www.ehow.com/how_3025_detect-treat-hyperthermia.html ?Before we leave this general consideration of the subject, it may be of interest to note that animals have numerous ways of keeping themselves cool. Some small rodents are supplied with ample spittle and wash themselves thoroughly if they are feeling too warm, the evaporation of the spittle providing them with sufficient cooling. Some other small animals are supplied with a specially structured tail which acts as a heat exchanger when positioned in a certain way and allows them to reduce body heat. The sweat glands of dogs and similar creatures are in the mouth, and the rapid exchange of air in panting provides them with sufficient evaporative cooling. Prehistoric animals, like the dimetrodon, were equipped with a sail-like structure on the back which served probably as a heat exchanger, acting in two ways: to remove body heat in hot weather and to gain solar heat in the cold. Some animals make the adjustment by reducing basal metabolism, while others immerse themselves in water or burrow into the cool ground. Birds lift their wings slightly. Whatever the means, the fact remains that there are limitations which generally restrict the species to a certain temperature zone. Man is virtually free of such restrictions, partly by reason of his ability to produce an artificial environment by clothing and shelter, but also because of his ability to resist a temperature rise by copious sweating and the consequent evaporative cooling. Not infrequently this copiousness may seem to be wasteful. But a considerable body of evidence exists to show that the few elements which do exist in the sweat are of importance to man, since his body is thereby washed with a slightly acid solution which serves to protect him against bacteria and fungi. Unevaporated sweat, which seems to be an overcompensation and a pure waste of body fluid, turns out to have a value of its own. In the one area of the body where the acid might be dangerous to himself, namely, in the forehead region, the sweat is prevented from running down into his eyes by the eyebrows.? http://custance.org/old/flood/5ch1.html You may find these sites interesting: This one is a great explanation of thermoregulation: ?Thermoregulation, or the maintenance of a fairly steady body temperature even under a variety of external conditions, is important to all animals because each species has a preferred body temperature at which functioning is optimal. These external conditions can include changes in temperature, vapor pressure, air velocity, and insulation among other factors that affect the temperature of the skin. Cold-blooded animals regulate their body temperature by selecting an appropriate external environment. Warm-blooded animals also rely on physiological mechanisms which can produce or dissipate heat? http://www.deas.harvard.edu/courses/es96/spring1997/web_page/health/thermreg.htm http://www.the-aps.org/publications/classics/mack.pdf http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/5/R1012 I hope this has answered your question .
