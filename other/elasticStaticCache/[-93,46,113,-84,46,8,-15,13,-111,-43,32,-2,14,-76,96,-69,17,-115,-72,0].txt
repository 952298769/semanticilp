softwoods thin layer 0.5-0.15 mm pathway for photosynthate (sap) down the tree Outer bark young stems primary &amp; secondary phloem inside epidermis with diameter growth epidermis ruptures peels away prior to this a new meristem forms in the phloem produces new protective cells meristem comes from parenchyma cells new meristem=phellogen=cork cambium phellogen divides periclinally produces phellem to outside phelloderm to inside phelloderm-phellogen-phellem=periderm tissues produced are different from phloem phellem cells are radially flattened short square-hexagonal cells variable in thickness thin walled cells impregnated with suberin (wax like material) thick walled cells are lignified (not suberinized) phellem protects plant from water loss phelloderm cells are also square to hexagonal (tangentially) usually flattened in radial direction some cells have large cross section-thermal insulation Periderms may function for several years retained in annual ring type arrangement New phellogen arises from parenchyma in phloem During growth phelloderm and phloem are crushed against each other Outer bark thickness 1.3-2.5cm aspen &gt;0.3 m redwood and Douglas-fir Chemical content of bark lignin content higher than wood carbohydrate content lower than wood minerals concentrated in bark ash content is higher 0.5% wood, 2-5% bark can cause problems in use as fuel extractives much higher in bark 15-26% bark, 2-9% wood bark extractives starches resins, waxes 25-50% by weight &quot;tannic acid&quot; viscosity control agents leather tanning, additives in inks and dye water extracts acidic may cause problems in utilization As value increases, determination of amounts is more important Volume of bark is a function of species stem diameter bark thickness can be measured directly or estimated by regression equations For a given species double bark thickness (inches) = constant + (regression coefficient * DOB) The constant and regression coefficient come from Table 7.5 in Haygreen and Bowyer DOB=diameter outside bark in inches for example: 10&quot; loblolly pine constant=0.642 regression coefficient=0.086 0.642 + (0.086 * 10)=1.502&quot; Next, double bark thickness can be used to determine bark volume as a % of total volume (i.e. wood +bark) bark volume as % of total= [(DOB 2 - DIB 2 )/ DOB 2 ]* 100 using the previous example of 10&quot; loblolly pine DOB=10&quot; DIB= 10-1.502=8.498&quot; ((10 2 - 8.498 2 )/10 2 )*100=27.784% bark can also be determined as a percentage of wood volume [(DOB 2 - DIB 2 )/ DIB 2 ]* 100 again using the 10&quot; pine as an example ((10 2 - 8.498 2 )/8.498 2 )*100=38.473% Bark is porous Bark volume must be adjusted to account for void volume adjusted bark volume bark as a % of total volume*(1-(% void volume/100)) =adjusted volume assuming a 25% void volume (guess based on Table 7.6) 27.784 * ( 1 - (25/100)) = 20.838%=adjusted bark \nvolume Specific gravity (density) highly variable depending on species if all voids are removed, bark is uniform specific gravity ~ 1.5 Strength low in comparison to wood inclusion in forest products must be done carefully since total strength can be
