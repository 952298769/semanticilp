energy from heat coming from within the Earth heat is generated by radioactive decay, friction (plate boundaries), and convection in the mantle (spreading centers) potential is not huge (currently less than 1% of global energy supply), but is potentially significant (about 10% of electrical energy needs could be met with geothermal energy...) 3 Types -- hydrothermal convection systems : circulation of steam or hot water (geysers) -- hot igneous systems : hot, dry rocks often associated with volcanic activity -- geopressurized systems : where heat flux from the Earth is trapped by a heat absorbing material (water) Geothermal Energy: Groundwater systems ground water systems can also be used as cooling and heating sources... ground water is usually isothermal (constant temperature), while air changes temperatures seasonally... because water holds heat more effectively than air idea is to draw heat from water in the winter to warm homes and offices and pumping heat
