Mark plants A, B and C. 2. Put cardboard pieces at the bottom of each bag. 3. Put plant A in one bag with one 250mL beaker half filled with water. Place Alka- Seltzer in water, twist close. 4. Put plant B in one bag. Put 50mL of Soda Lime in a Petri dish and place in bag with plant B, twist close. 5. Put plant C in one bag. Twist close. (This is the \"control\" plant.) 6. Find a sunny place in your classroom to place all three plants. (The plants must have same amount of sunlight and water.) The plants are to set for one day. 7. After one day, remove plants from bags.
