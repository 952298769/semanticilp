NITE Thursday is a big event for me it starts at noon and ends sometime late saturday morning If I hadn't fallen down the stairs and sullied myself I'd still be at it tonight but sometimes mental incontinence is not a good thing I was saying things like I want a blue drink I want a green drink and the last clear memory I had was a dim voice down a long dark hall saying--don't drink that so I was being belligerent with a big guy It's the kind of thing that happens when things are not happening well and I'm the king of things that aren't happening I kind of came to when I was fucking my neighbor in the flower bed beauty strikes deep and then truth chases her naked across the street someone called the police but they said it was a domestic matter and that's what I like about New Orleans you can chase your girlfriend naked across the street and not get arrested and in the morning you can talk about it to someone who knows what you're talking about but I move in a magic circle with magic friends and I know that god has pulled us out of the hat to entertain a world full of people who don't know the trick and no matter how many steering wheels go to sleep in our arms we always wake up in our own cars in our own clothes in a city that's still on a map with a phone number and an address in our pocket we've all got powers that no one knows about and even when they're weak they work but my best days were spent in a crossfire between a coma and a photoflash long slow afternoons next to a girl with makeup on her panties and all her cruelties mysteriously spent elswhere I don't know where so don't interupt me sometimes my only goal is not to let a blackout last for more than 10 seconds and sometimes it's two days before I find out my car keys were in my shoes I'm 44 which is 17 in Yoda years It took me a long time to figure out the trick because it's not just one trick we need a suitcase of tricks to get by but it's hard to catch yourself in the middle of it that's why we try catch each other because everything has it's own velocity sometimes it's vertical and sometimes it's earth speed which is undetectable but static is like a glaze thorn in my head and sometimes waiting in a room is unforgivable and I'm tired of writing I'm bored I'm armed I don't feel like talking I've smuggled the secrets out of the bad place but I'm not sure whose side is who so I'll go down any street just see what's there because it's never a walk about what's here it's always about what's there and there's some guy talking on a cell phone with an audible dial tone and he's saying \" I'd give you a ride in my jet but it's in Columbia right now\" so maybe if he came in on a donkey with palm leaves in his beard I'd give him a free drink but that's the moment when suddenly god becomes temporary and I realize No he's not fucking with me he's just being stupid and it's my own personal Heck so maybe it's not going to be great maybe it's just gonna be crazy this way who cares so much for philosophy it's all gone soft and this's gettin too close to heaven I need to take a break I might be bitter but I'm not pissy and we're gonna keep on getting crazy VODKA, GRACE &amp; CHAKRAS I want to be the Yoda of cash --feel the money Luke I want a little vodka grace and kisses to fuel the chakras I want to see my hands when I dream I'm tired of all the cautious sorcery I want to trade in my righteousness for an ashtray or some other famous mystery apocalypse is the only game I'll play or I won't play at all it's a repetition of unpredictables a vacation from explanations just one big fat whatever designed to be erased so I called on the saint of self destruction I pushed the joy buzzer in the funhouse and got caught between floors in a chrome and glass elevator with a post-traumatic tele-pathetic tune-in turn-on \nand beam me up stomp-down king-daddy eye of god I wanted to go to Hollywood but this part of the plane doesn't go there I just want to take a gradual look at the beautiful I don't know that there's a god out there but if there is I'd appreciate her help I always imagine her to be some kind of lock-down goddess like the butter lady on the butter box I just want to get stupid up in california roll up a left-hander and revolve right back into the fucking wack-fucked primal fucking ooze no clock no phone no light until I'm done that'll put a nice little slant on your DNA --don't do it if you want to keep it but I can't hang on to everything I'll just keep it up until my ability to see patterns gets a little too amped and everything gets so omenistic I just keep thinkin' about it matter of fact I'm afraid that something paranormal could be putting its landing gear down in my naked neo-cortex even as we speak but it's not gettin' done by my head because I'm not thinking I'm not learning I'm remembering I'm enlightened but I don't know how correct I am there are maps of the enormous submerged in every moment and when they perpetrate the brilliance and I want it all to be stupid because I'm amazed by how assured everyone is such a beautiful collection of faces for each other fresh young minds in a fine young world, yeah, that'll last about half a block it's all the strangled hysterics of a culture emptied of its magic a people whose rituals no longer resonate with the unseen sleep walking in that bare oblivion something so furiously empty it's always been devouring itself a blast pit mandala in a circle of souls on an empty night that became empty afternoons again angel of oppression I know who I am I've been saved all-to-hell by a phone voice on hold and I've been looking through a window propped open with a clock ticking down to zero and I've been slamming the receiver down relentlessly tell me what's art so I can stop doing it how long will my soul have to be inside out before it can be outside in I can feel my reflection move like a secret equator around one of my immensely dangerous selves angels fly away from the blast but I can't to say which one is coming and which one is going away I got a whole precarious sartori situation goin' on I still have a language I just don't have the words and today no longer feels like any day matter of fact it doesn't feel like anything at all It feels like one of those days in between days first beginnings are always the same always in excess there isn't much more so let me go on it's 3 in the afternoon and I'm drunk as fucking mardi-gras with a bunch of strangers who love me and I'm losing my shit to a sad song on a jukebox in a bar I don't even know I'm just in it and I know that the fate that left me here will come back to pick me up this city is temptation at it's finest and sometimes you got to put a hole in the wall just to see what's going on no bad about it I've had strange environments before but I'm safe in New Orleans now just bring me presents and call me daddy because time flies when we're having fun and it stops when we say stop but time just keeps passing us by and doesn't talk to anyone and we can't say stop we can't say anything at all and time never turns off NO TITLE NO NAME \"the loneliness is sating\" -- Rilke I think too much My mind is constantly banking from thought to thought in a long graceful slur toward a more distant orbit swarming with the mystic and insane and floating among the rusted spines of angels but my mind is a beautiful engine that will always take me places even long after it breaks down there's an aloneness that comes with intelligence but it's not an emptiness it's a solitude that fills everything and there's a terror that comes with knowing but it's a terror without paranoia or conspiracy and there's the pain with great knowledge comes great pain but that great pain is constantly stretching its fingertips across the skin of great pleasure in the most beautiful and most final form of S &amp; M but those whom the gods would destroy they must first drive mad those whom they drive mad they must first haunt those whom they haunt they must first talk to and the tongues of gods speak in all things both great and small and all things count in big amounts but those who've been destroyed are no longer haunted -- to those who've been destroyed the voices simply talk and so we're left somewhere between the answers that gather and the answers that float always drifting sideways between the past stretched out into a gray light behind us and the future falling away into that invisible and uneasy space of silent and mysterious escapes but even when we release the old ghosts from old places and allow all things to be right We still slip in a thin vapor between the constellating sky and the crystallizing ground between the stars they say are above us and the so-called dirt they say is beneath us I \ndon't really know I just keep talking I don't know if I'm a guru a little down on his luck or a street clown with a limp going broke on decateur street truth is I'm probably still slipping somewhere between the two of them so maybe it's that moment between an unplanned kiss and the moment you think about it or maybe its that moment between that one thing about how you're both really different and the other thing when you're both really drunk we're nothing but mirrors of each other but until you've seen a thing empty you'll never know what it's filled with the eyes are the window of the soul if you don't see what you want in the window go inside and ask THE BOOK OF FEVERS it's 7:56 on a second floor Sunday morning in New Orleans I lean back in my chair on the balcony bottom of my feet up on the cool metal rail just cool enough to let me know I'm still alive and my body is still warm and the sun shines on the bottom of my feet just hot enough to let me know that my body has cooled down to the heat of life and not death just enough to let me know I'm back in the world of warmth and light tiny birds shadowed but not quite blue or black snap erratically through the air swinging their tiny yoyo lives around that invisible string whose other end is firmly looped around god's middle finger my left ball rolls down through the huge rip in my shorts slow and easy until it touches down on the cold metal chair and draws back up into the persistant warmth of the body skin and hair still damp and sticky from two days of fever and hallucinations unconcious and alone I peal off my shirt and let my belly buddha in the sun let the sweet beeze from the top branches in the trees lift away what's left of two days of urinous sweat five times I've had these fevers alone unconcious in a bed or on a floor for days with no one around waking thin and weak shaking like a baby and I know what the earth is doing she's been getting me ready she's preparing me to undergo a complicated alchemy where I won't have the words or hear the voices and I won't see the hands or feel the faces and she's teaching me how to die the way it's always done alone my first fever came when I was seven and when it was over my eyes were blurred hearing numbed the finger tips moved without me and after that came all the other crazy fevers fevers in flophouses and rotten rooms sweating it all out uncontrollably soaked in purities and impurities ruining sheets and beds while the real part of me abstracted itself into the world elsewhere branding my mind with visions and then there were the biochem fevers the bad acid that left me cramped and shaking fingernails cold an blue and the good acid that took me out of my mind and then took my mind out of my body and left me float on that invisible blue tether fragile as a kite in the electric current of this collosal universe where faces fade into smoke and the smoke fades into twilight and the twilight fades into deep space as the stars go out one at a time and then suddenly all at once as it all falls into the void but after I had gone there once every journey back into this world is somehow more than just being born again and somehow less because a fever is a starship that burns the spirit for fuel but God's just getting messy with me and he's made me the poster child for spirtiual birth defects freshly awakened from that burned out vision but everything that didn't quit kill me off in this world left me more insane and airborne in the next left the rest of me more alive in that unbearable grace across the street an old lady is pushing a cart of groceries her body is frail and wieghted down she stops for a moment looks up at me and we both nod to each other and when she lifts up her head her smile just floats in the air like a little girl and for a moment of no particular time or length I see her face as a young woman and the humanity of it all overwhelms me and I have the great tears inside until I feel my left ball on cold metal again and I realize my balls are still hanging out but sometimes it's like that I'm with a friend or a total stranger and we both nod at the same time about anythng or nothing at all and what it is doesn't matter it never matters all that matters is that we both wanted the other to be right at the same time everyone wants to be the exception but there are no exceptions the years go by in the billions and we don't I'm not saying this because it happens I'm saying \"this\" because many things happen and I don't want the answer I don't need to know the answer all I need is something that will make me stop asking the question GOODBYE in a goodbye to some rare blue our sleep is taken out of context floating quietly in place without us beneath our dark and silent arms any dream of knowing winds aimlessly away under the twisting stars and their alcohols aching with unfinished happinesses our eyes are \nslowly filling with a drowned light the old photographs overflow and endure the old dream of dying alone in the weather beneath the pursuing forms the moon sings lightly in a black sleepless dress as it leans against a bare woman swaying down and farther down beyond any dream of knowing just let the rain come in in between here and when we left an old photoflash will empty the heart as it shrinks back into place and the days will grow roomy which is just \"too bad\" in a long line of \"too bad\"s. issues 5 &amp; 6 home | ec chair | broken news | celine | critical urgencies | burning

punched out paychecks like black and white southerners had never seen in their lives, when the air raid sirens would go off every night for drills--worrying the Germans or Japs would bomb us, when the fire from the steel mills lit up the sky every night and colored it pink and gray each day, when Sarah would walk down Broadway and all the men would stop, hold their breath and stare--when Horse would take me riding on Highway 20 about 90 miles an hour, when old Griffin would put away his police badge, take few drinks at the bar then take me fishing for perch--but we'd always catch Carp and Cats--when old Smith lived down the cellar by the furnace with his gray and blue coveralls smelling like coal and sweat, always wanting to come with my dad so he could go out into Clark Woods to dig up Goldenseal and other herbs and potions so he could make his medicines, for his ladies, for his people, and Maggie, she was big and strong, but had a way and a smell like the men who chased from the time she came in until she decided who she wanted--and Ali M'Zaham, called him Ali Ceekee because he talked so much and walked like a duck, and my father, not that tall, but a man larger because he was imposing with the intensity of his look, intensity of his way, and there I was 4, maybe 5 or 6, my mother is dead so I can't resurrect the dates, and we'd go down every night, the joint was jumpin', jammed like sardines, rubbing up against and laughing with each other, music banging from the bandstand, and in the bar we had a booth where my mother would bring food for my father--he'd sit and eat, I'd drink cokes and eat Mrs. Klein's potato chips--the waitresses would come by and say &quot; looks like little Sam&quot; and &quot;when you comin' to work, rather work for you than your daddy&quot; and &quot;you looking just like yo' daddy, watch out&quot; and there was always Rosie, sometimes she'd come down from upstairs and sit with us-she worked for us at our hotel on 3rd and Jefferson--she was older than my folks, and she was like my mother's older sister, or maybe like her mother, because she knew my mother's mother had died when my mother was l2--so she had so much to learn in this strange place, this place so far from the farmlands, from the small town of Fort Dodge, Iowa, so far away from her father and her brothers and sisters, so far away on 2 lane roads that wound through small towns and took forever to travel, small towns with one gas station and a little restaurant and post-office-now she was here in the midst of this noise, fast bar, gray smoke of steel mills, a bar full of people all way from Chicago and Detroit and heavy cigarette din and music from another world, I know now that only Rosie understood how she felt, but always the people saw her innocence and ease with everyone, no one was foreign to her, no one was an enemy, she had no fear, she just drove the old truck, that red panel l935 Chevy each night, and I'd be with her, later Buddea came wrapped in baby blankets and Rosie would have to help her more and Sarah would come to say, &quot;I want me one of these&quot; and we'd hear Horse's laughter when he'd come and grab Sarah, I'd never seen so much love in anyone's eyes until I saw yours --now I know of these different kinds of love--the kind of everloving, open, without reservation type of love you feel from your mother, the demanding type you feel from your father, the protective \ntype you feel from Rosie, the uncle type from old Smith and Griffin, my uncles Abudee and M'humed, and Horse would pick me up some time and put me over his head, but I knew he'd never drop me, I was his and Sarah's and my mother and dad's, and my grandfather's, he who used to come visit, with his big shoulders from digging in his garden and carrying white goods in suitcases for 8 and l0 days at a time selling to farm wives, from Iowa, and in the old days when I was 2 and 3 and we lived at the old hotel in a single room, he'd take me out in the morning, we'd stop at the store and get bananas, then we'd walk down Broadway across the bridge to the Pennsy or the B &amp; O Lines, we'd stand there, next to the huge black freight engines, or we'd go down to see the New York Central engines, sleek and silver, with big rods extending from wheel to wheel, steam hissing out of the huge barrels on the sides of the engines, the engineers leaning out with their red kerchiefs, waving to us, yelling for a banana, they always waved to us kids and we'd wave back, and we knew some of the switchers who rode in the caboose, some lived in my old man's hotel, 3rd and Jefferson--we had the hotel before we had the bar-- that's where I met Rosie, Nellie who did the cleaning, Mexican John, old Bushy, Nick of the apple cider, Wagner, who I used to think was the famous Honus Wagner who had gone to drink and was living in our hotel, Schenley who used to get drunk every night, sit on the steps of my dad's hotel and swim the Atlantic to get to England and the war, Sam Grimmit who'd argue with you from afternoon until the next morning that a Ford was better than a Chevy and he knew that from all the years of moonshine running in Tennessee, John who'd been to Hollwood and had a photo with his face like John Barrymore standing beside a Greek column shooting a bow and arrow, and William who'd been rich, a shriner/mason, lost his money,lost his wife and left his suitcases in storage at The Ambassador East and ended up living in a single room at our hotel, a man who kept the Masonic Bible in his zipped suitcase, a beautiful Bancroft bamboo tennis racquet he gave me for taking him to Chicago and waiting for him while he wore his sportcoat and nice slacks in to get his stuff from storage and to talk with the hotel people he knew, he had lost his suite or apartment at the hotel--I never understood it all, but I felt sad and told him to keep the tennis racquet, that he'd play again, he said he wouldn't, said he wished he could, said a lot of things, I can't remember them all, but I knew they were full of regrets and sorrow about his wife and his life and his drinking, but he wanted me to have the racquet because he saw the cheap racquet I had and that I couldn't play a decent game with it-and he even gave me the silk zipper cover that came with it, the type of cover they made for only the very expensive racquets in those days.",0.44582003355026245],["UNIT 7 - DATA INPUT Compiled with assistance from Jeffrey L. Star, University of California at Santa Barbara, and Holly Dickinson, SUNY Buffalo A. INTRODUCTION need to have tools to transform spatial data of various types into digital format data input is a major bottleneck in application of GIS technology costs of input often consume 80% or more of project costs data input is labor intensive, tedious, error-prone there is a danger that construction of the database may become an end in itself and the project may not move on to analysis of the data collected essential to find ways to reduce costs, maximize accuracy need to automate the input process as much as possible, but: automated input often creates bigger editing problems later source documents (maps) may often have to be redrafted to meet rigid quality requirements of automated input because of the costs involved, much research has gone into devising better input methods - however, few reductions in cost have been realized sharing of digital data is one way around the input bottleneck more and more spatial data is becoming available in digital form data input to a GIS involves encoding both the locational and attribute data the locational data is encoded as coordinates on a particular cartesian coordinate system source maps may have different projections, scales several stages of data transformation may be needed to bring all data to a common coordinate system attribute data is often obtained and stored in tables Modes of data input keyboard entry for non-spatial attributes and occasionally locational data manual locating devices user directly manipulates a device whose location is recognized by the computer e.g. digitizing automated devices automatically extract spatial data from maps and photography e.g. scanning conversion directly from other digital sources voice input has been tried, particularly for controlling digitizer operations not very successful - machine needs to be recalibrated for each operator, after coffee breaks, etc. B. DIGITIZERS digitizers are the most common device for extracting spatial information from maps and photographs the map, photo, or other document is placed on the flat surface of the digitizing tablet Hardware the position of an indicator as it is moved over the surface of the digitizing tablet is detected by the computer and interpreted as pairs of x,y coordinates the indicator may be a pen-like stylus or a cursor (a small flat plate the size of a hockey puck with a cross-hair) frequently, there are control buttons on the cursor which permit control of the system without having to turn attention from the digitizing tablet to a computer terminal digitizing tablets can be purchased in sizes from 25x25 cm to 200x150 cm, at approximate costs from $500 to $5,000 early digitizers (ca. 1965) were backlit glass tables a magnetic field generated by the cursor was tracked mechanically by an arm located behind the table the arm's motion was encoded, coordinates computed and sent to a host processor some early low-cost systems had mechanically linked cursors - the free-cursor digitizer was initially much more expensive the first solid-state systems used a spark generated by the cursor and detected by linear microphones problems with errors generated by ambient noise contemporary tablets use a grid of wires embedded in the tablet to generate a magnetic field which is detected by the cursor accuracies are typically better than 0.1 mm this is better than the accuracy with which the average operator can position the cursor functions for transforming coordinates are sometimes built into the tablet and used to process data before it is sent to the host The digitizing operation the map is affixed to a digitizing table three or more control points (\"reference points\", \"tics\", etc.) are digitized for each map sheet these will be easily identified points (intersections of major streets, major peaks, points on coastline) the coordinates of these points will \nbe known in the coordinate system to be used in the final database, e.g. lat/long, State Plane Coordinates, military grid the control points are used by the system to calculate the necessary mathematical transformations to convert all coordinates to the final system the more control points, the better digitizing the map contents can be done in two different modes: in point mode, the operator identifies the points to be captured explicitly by pressing a button in stream mode points are captured at set time intervals (typically 10 per second) or on movement of the cursor by a fixed amount advantages and disadvantages: in point mode the operator selects points subjectively two point mode operators will not code a line in the same way stream mode generates large numbers of points, many of which may be redundant stream mode is more demanding on the user while point mode requires some judgement about how to represent the line most digitizing is currently done in point mode Problems with digitizing maps arise since most maps were not drafted for the purpose of digitizing paper maps are unstable: each time the map is removed from the digitizing table, the reference points must be re-entered when the map is affixed to the table again if the map has stretched or shrunk in the interim, the newly digitized points will be slightly off in their location when compared to previously digitized points errors occur on these maps, and these errors are entered into the GIS database as well the level of error in the GIS database is directly related to the error level of the source maps maps are meant to display information, and do not always accurately record locational information for example, when a railroad, stream and road all go through a narrow mountain pass, the pass may actually be depicted wider than its actual size to allow for the three symbols to be drafted in the pass discrepancies across map sheet boundaries can cause discrepancies in the total GIS database e.g. roads or streams that do not meet exactly when two map sheets are placed next to each other user error causes overshoots, undershoots (gaps) and spikes at intersection of lines diagram user fatigue and boredom for a complete discussion on the manual digitizing process, see Marble et al, 1984 Editing errors from digitizing some errors can be corrected automatically small gaps at line junctions overshoots and sudden spikes in lines error rates depend on the complexity of the map, are high for small scale, complex maps these topics are explored in greater detail in later Units Unit 13 looks at the process of editing digitized data Units 45 and 46 discuss digitizing error Digitizing costs a common rule of thumb in the industry is one digitized boundary per minute e.g. it would take 99/60 = 1.65 hours to digitize the boundaries of the 99 counties of Iowa C. SCANNERS Video scanner essentially television cameras, with appropriate interface electronics to create a computer-readable dataset available in either black and white or color extremely fast (scan times of under 1 second) relatively inexpensive ($500 - $10,000) produce a raster array of brightness (or color) values, which are then processed much like any other raster array typical data arrays from video scanners are of the order of 250 to 1000 pixels on a side typically have poor geometrical and radiometrical characteristics, including various kinds of spatial distortions and uneven sensitivity to brightness across the scanned field video scanners are difficult to use for map input because of problems with distortion and interpretation of features Electromechanical scanner unlike the video scanning systems, electromechanical systems are typically more expensive ($10,000 to 100,000) and slower, but can create better quality products one common class of scanners involves attaching the graphic to a drum as the drum rotates about its axis, a scanner head containing a light source and photodetector reads the reflectivity of the target graphic, and digitizing this signal, creates a single column of pixels from the graphic the scanner head moves along the axis of the drum to create the next column of pixels, and so on through the entire scan compare the action of a lathe in a machine shop this controls distortion by bringing the single light source and detector to position on a regular grid of locations on the graphic systems may have a scan spot size of as little as 25 micrometers, and be able to scan graphics of the order of 1 meter on a side an alternative mechanism involves an array of photodetectors which extract data from several rows of the raster simultaneously the detector moves across the document in a swath when all the columns have been scanned, the detector moves to a new swath of rows for an in-depth discussion scanning techniques, see Peuquet and Boyle (1984) Requirements for scanning documents must be clean (no smudges or extra markings) lines should be at least 0.1 mm wide complex line work provides greater chance of error in scanning text may be accidently scanned as line features contour lines cannot be broken with text automatic feature recognition is not easy (two contour lines vs. road symbols) diagram special symbols (e.g. marsh symbols) must be recognized and dealt with if good source documents are available, scanning can be an efficient time saving mode of data input D. CONVERSION FROM OTHER DIGITAL SOURCES involves transferring data from one system to another by means of a conversion program more and more data is becoming available in magnetic media USGS digital cartographic data (DLGs - Digital Line Graphs) digital elevation models (DEMs) TIGER and other census related data data from CAD/CAM systems (AutoCAD, DXF) data from other GIS these data generally are supplied on digital tapes that must be read into the computer however, CD-ROM is becoming increasingly popular for this purpose provides better standards CD-ROM hardware is much less expensive - CD-ROM drive $ \n1000, tape drive $14,000 Automated Surveying directly determines the actual horizontal and vertical positions of objects two kinds of measurements are made: distance and direction traditionally, distance measuring involved pacing, chains and tapes of various materials direction measurements were made with transits and theodolites modern surveyors have a number of automated tools to make distance and direction measurements easier electronic systems measure distance using the time of travel of beams of light or radio waves by measuring the round-trip time of travel, from the observing instrument to the object in question and back, we can use the relationship (d = v x t) to determine the distance an instrument based on timing the travel of a pulse of infrared light can measure distances on the order of 10 km with a standard deviation of +/- 15 mm the total station (cost about $30,000) captures distance and direction data in digital form the data is downloaded to a host computer at the end of each session for direct input to GIS and other programs Global Positioning System (GPS) a new tool for determining accurate positions on the surface of the earth computes positions from signals received from a series of satellites (NAVSTAR) as of April, 1990 there are 20 in orbit, by 1991 there should be the full set of 24 are currently 7 active but eventually will be 21 depends on precise information about the orbits of the satellites a radio receiver with appropriate electronics is connected to a small antenna, and depending on the method used, in one hour to less than 1 second, the system is able to determine its location in 3-",0.43982377648353577],["X1014305702-00173-36372</DOCNO> Idiom Definition Index C Wayne Magnuson: English Idioms Idiom Definition

Wilkins Martin Wignall, normally a man of great inner strength, known among his neighborhood and his town as one of those people whose mere presence brings peace to those struggling with conflict and whose insights were universally regarded as a blessing to those given the gift of hearing them, known as a man always well-dressed and forever in perfect form, nails manicured, hair just so, conservative wire-rimmed eyeglasses always exactly in place and never prone to slip down his nose, known as the father of eight perfect little girls all ten years old and themselves always precisely poised, known as a man whose only ignominious moment had been at the age of twenty-three when, seized by a terrible impure fit of jealousy completely unlike him, he had struck with a tremendous 1948 Ford pickup truck and repeatedly backed over again and again his best friend Phil Kardass who in a moment of passion had defiled the fidelity of Martin's one true love, a strange, quiet young lady named June, June for whom the flowers would sing and whose tears over the premature death of Phil would stain the hitherto perfect pattern of Martin's soul for all eternity, Martin, known as a man who managed to fight off with remarkable persistence the unfortunately periodic urge to fondle his daughters, only slipping his hands where they didn't belong on the unusual day when his inner strength was not exactly so great as perhaps it should have been had his steeled resistance to temptation been godlike rather than merely human, though occasionally, just between you and me, those few unusual days on which he would touch his daughters would sometimes feature in Martin's behavior the extremes of human perversity to an extent that the general knowledge of his behavior would perhaps not have been quite so flattering had the story gotten out among his peers, a group of people whose tolerance of fathers fondling their little girls was, shall we say, low, lower in fact than in many small towns which already share a much higher ethical and moral standard than, say, Los Angeles, in which I dare say you could find a neighborhood in which it probably is considered, heaven forbid, almost normal to cop a feel with one's daughter once in a while, not that I'm suggesting that you move there or anything should you be inclined to such things, and certainly not that I'm suggesting that such neighborhoods should not be burned to the ground as decent men would were they marked clearly in flaming red letters on the street maps, was much surprised to find himself called upon by society as he had been, as a man of such character would have to be, especially growing up in such a town as he did in which children, except his own young girls, of course, who did not experience the benefit of their parents assiduously protecting their innocence by declining to fondle \nthem every single time the temptation arose rather than only the vast majority of the time, were sheltered from the knowledge of the big, wide adult world out there, the world which many adults would love to forget and be children again if only they did not know that they would be assaulted by that adult world in their nightmares even if spared the day-to-day exposure to horror and perversity which marks adulthood, fearing even the walk to the parking lot, as sadly many adults of today do, fearing the occasional black man who walks down the street, although God knows there are a few black men who are alright and it is the responsibility of every Christian to give the odd black man the benefit of the doubt, even if it is most likely that the black man is unemployed, living on the handouts provided by those damned bleeding- heart liberals whose high-minded ideals are bleeding our own hearts dry, or worse, that the black man is a murderer who has yet to be caught, or perhaps a murderer at heart who has yet to murder, and perhaps should be dispatched immediately to spare his victim the pain of acting out the performance which will make the black man fulfill his destiny, even though the liberal courts could not support such a thing, even if Martin Wignall, in the midst of fondling his daughters, would, yes, Martin was surprised enough that it took him uncomfortable minutes to find his bags, minutes which would have been much more difficult to spare, had he known of the surveillance, the call on the radio of the police car, the plump, balding man setting aside his jelly doughnut carefully so as not to stain his bright blue uniform shirt, his shiny badge which he loved so much, his stylish yet classic hat which sat on the seat beside him, or his beautiful, yet more classic, Beretta 9mm pistol which would come unusually handy in a very short while, to the plump man's great surprise, or had Martin even known of the call his wife had made a week before, crying in the dark, hoping that her husband would not awaken to find her out of bed, but since he knew none of these things Martin remained willing to look for the bags despite his surprise at the Lieutenant's phone call, and though the car pulled up as he started to throw his clothing, half of it dirty, into the bags, since the plump man did not run the siren Martin did not see the car and continued at a measured, methodical pace, to pack, the kind of pace at which you see paramedics work to rescue a victim, a kind of controlled rush which allows them to calmly take all the necessary steps without going so fast that they will skip the essential, for the manner in which society had expressed its needs to Martin was in the form of the Lieutenant's phone call, which stated that he was to give himself up peacefully and that a car would be dispatched to fetch him some thirty minutes hence, when in fact the car was dispatched much sooner with instructions to wait outside Martin's door to prevent his attempt to flee, as is sometimes done when kind police lieutenants wish to spare their apprehendee the embarrassment of having to prepare their personal effects with an officer watching, but usually only of course when the police lieutenant does not know about such ignominious moments as Martin's backing over Phil again and again and again to drive the image in his head of Phil and June pursuing their own ignominious moment of human joy away, as the police lieutenant presiding in Martin's town on the day of his attempted apprehension did not, \"attempted,\" I say, because as Martin heard the crack of a twig outside and peered out the window he realized the trap which had been set for him and searched for his own beloved 9mm Beretta, a tool which for moments of desperation many of those who fondle their eight daughters all the same age might very well be advised to hide away, as did Martin, posessed of the gift of foresight, but when he found the pistol he discovered it to be bereft of cartridges, a sad comment on the state of Martin's preparation considering how truly inexpensive a box of the things can be if you look in the right place, so Martin was left with no other option than to attempt to sneak out the back, an attempt in which Martin was thwarted by the simple and depressing fact that he had welded the back door shut to keep unwanted visitors away, especially during private trysts with his daughters, and having had his one option taken from him he searched his head for the option which really was no option at all, to seize his wife and hold the pistol to her head as he walked down the front steps, comically trying to carry his bags over his shoulders, a course of action which left his emotionally destroyed wife in a foggy state of psychological disrepair, as the frozen image of the bag over Martin's shoulder swinging beneath her eyes recalled to her the romantic trip, taken in younger, more carefree days, the trip on which she and Martin had fallen in love all over again for the first time since her true love Phil had been run over again and again and again by Martin's 1948 Ford pickup, and on which six of the eight daughters had been conceived, the other two daughters having been the product of two minor infidelities which were such small trifles as not to have formed a real mark on Martin's record, for even good Christians enjoy a little trifle with someone on the side, if you know what I mean, and \neven so June had forgiven Martin because on the trip she'd fallen so much in love again, and besides, it's hard to run out on the man whose virile tendencies have just been the cause of sextuplets growing within you, especially when you yourself have no real means by which to support yourself, let alone six children, but the warm memory of the trip floating through June's mind was not enough to blot out the harsh sound of a gunshot which echoed through the air or the warm feeling of blood on her shoulder from the awful gaping wound in Martin's head, for as all good Christians know an unloaded Beretta with no clip has a big hole in the handle and it can be very hard, in the haste of a difficult emotional situation, to remember to protect such a detail from an attentive police officer such as the plump man was, especially if the sugar with which the jelly doughnut was laced had heightened the officer's otherwise adrenaline-pumped senses of awareness to the point at which he would see that there were no danger to killing Martin even if there were in fact such danger, but fortunately there was not, and before Martin had even dropped to the ground unconscious the officer had shaken off his panic with the ease of the righteous killer and had reached for the jelly doughnut, which yielded up to him with just the right amount of resistance another chewy, sweet, succulent bite, ripe with the flavor of cherry, a flavor so perfect as to even overwhelm the plump man's flush of success.",0.40721839666366577]]
