Merwin CHAPTER ONE CEREMONY AFTER AN AMPUTATION Spirits of the place who were here before I saw it to whom I have made such offerings as I have known how to make wanting from the first to approach you with recognition bringing for your swept ridge trees lining the wind with seedlings that have grown now to become these long wings in chorus where the birds assemble and settle their flying lives you have taught me without meaning and have lifted me up without talk or promise and again and again reappeared to me unmistakable and changing and unpronounceable as a face dust of the time a day in late spring after the silk of rain had fallen softly through the night and after the green morning the afternoon floating brushed with gold and then the sounds of machines erupting across the valley and elbowing up the slopes pushing themselves forward to occupy you to be more of you who remain the untouched silence through which they are passing I try to hear you remembering that we are not separate to find you who cannot be lost or elsewhere or incomplete nature of the solitary machine coming into the story from the minds that conceived you and the hands that first conjured up the phantom of you in fine lines on the drawing board you for whom function is all the good that exists you to whom I have come with nothing but purpose a purpose of my own as though it was something we shared you that were pried from the earth without anyone consulting you and were carried off burned beaten metamorphosed according to plans and lives to which you owed nothing let us be at peace with each other let peace be what is between us and you now single vanished part of my left hand bit of bone finger- end index who began with me in the dark that was already my mother you who touched whatever I could touch of the beginning and were how I touched and who remembered the sense of it when I thought I had forgotten it you in whom it waited under your only map of one untrodden mountain you who did as well as we could through all the hours at the piano and who helped undo the bras and found our way to the treasure and who held the fruit and the pages and knew how to button my right cuff and to wash my left ear and had taken in heart beats of birds and beloved faces and hair by day and by night fur of dogs ears of horses tongues and the latches of doors so that I still feel them clearly long after they are gone and lake water beside the boat one evening of an ancient summer and the vibration of a string over which a bow was moving as though the sound of the note were still playing and the hand of my wife found in the shallows of waking you who in a flicker of my inattention signalled to me once only my error telling me of the sudden blow from the side so that I looked down to see not you any longer but instead a mouth full of blood calling after you who had already gone gone gone ahead into what I cannot know or reach or touch leaving in your place only the cloud of pain rising into the day filling the light possessing every sound becoming the single color and taste and direction yet as the pain recedes and the moment of it you remain with me even in the missing of you small boat moving before me on the current under the daylight whatever you had touched and had known and took with you is with me now as you are when you are already there unseen part of me reminding me warning me pointing to what I cannot see never letting me forget you are my own speaking only to me going with me all \nthe rest of the way telling me what is still here THE STRANGER (After a Guarani legend recorded by Ernesto Morales) One day in the forest there was somebody who had never been there before it was somebody like the monkeys but taller and without a tail and without so much hair standing up and walking on only two feet and as he went he heard a voice calling Save me as the stranger looked he could see a snake a very big snake with a circle of fire that was dancing all around it and the snake was trying to get out but every way it turned the fire was there so the stranger bent the mink of a young tree and climbed out over the fire until he could hold a branch down to the snake and the snake wrapped himself around the branch and the stranger pulled the snake up out of the fire and as soon as the snake saw that he was free he twined himself around the stranger and started to crush the life out of him but the stranger shouted No No I am the one who has just saved your life and you pay me back by trying to kill me but the snake said I am keeping the law it is the law that whoever does good receives evil in return and he drew his coils tight around the stranger but the stranger kept on saying No No I do not believe that is the law so the snake said I will show you I will show you three times and you will see and he kept his coils tight around the stranger's neck and all around his arms and body but he let go of the stranger's legs Now walk he said to the stranger Keep going so they started out that way and they came to a river and the river said to them I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I save them from dying of thirst and all they do is stir up the mud and fill my water with dead things the snake said One the stranger said Let us go on and they did and they came to a carand&#225;-i palm there were wounds running with sap on its trunk and the palm tree was moaning I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I give them my fruit and my shade and they cut me and drink from my body until I die the snake said Two the stranger said Let us go on and they did and came to a place where they heard whimpering and saw a dog with his paw in a basket and the dog said I did a good thing and this is what came of it I found a jaguar who had been hurt and I took care of him and he got better and as soon as he had his strength again he sprang at me wanting to eat me up I managed to get away but he tore my paw I hid in a cave until he was gone and here in this basket I have a calabash full of milk for my wound but now I have pushed it too far down to reach will you help me he said to the snake and the snake liked milk better than anything so he slid off the stranger and into the basket and when he was inside the dog snapped it shut and swung it against a tree with all his might again and again until the snake was dead and after the snake was dead in there the dog said to the stranger Friend I have saved your life and the stranger took the dog home with him and treated him the way the stranger would treat a dog THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES At what moment can it be said to occur the grand stillness of this symmetry whose horizons become the horizon and whose designer's name seems to be Ours even when the designer has long since vanished and the king his master whom they called The Sun in his day is nobody again here are the avenues of light reflected and magnified and here the form's vast claim to have been true forever as the law of a universe in which nothing appears to change and there was nothing before this except defects of Nature and a waste of marshes a lake a chaos of birds and wild things a river making its undirected way it was always the water that was motion even while thirty six thousand men and six thousand horses for more than three decades diverted it into a thousand fountains and when all those men and horses had gone the water flowed on and the sound of water falling echoes in the dream the dream of water in which the avenues all of them are the river on its own way CHORUS The wet bamboo clacking in the night rain crying in the darkness whimpering softly as the hollow columns touch and slide along each other swaying with the empty air these are sounds from before there were voices gestures older than grief from before there was pain as we know it the impossibly tall stems are reaching out groping and waving before longing as we think of it or loss as we are acquainted with it or feelings able to recognize the syllables that might be their own calling out to them like names in the dark telling them nothing about loss or about longing nothing ever about all that has yet to answer WHAT IS A GARDEN All day working happily down near the stream bed the light passing into the remote opalescence it \nreturns to as the year wakes toward winter a season of rain in a year already rich in rain with masked light emerging on all sides in the new leaves of the palms quietly waving time of mud and slipping and of overhearing the water under the sloped ground going on whispering as it travels time of rain thundering at night and of rocks rolling and echoing in the torrent and of looking up after noon through the high branches to see fine rain drifting across the sunlight over the valley that was abused and at last left to fill with thickets of rampant aliens bringing habits but no stories under the mango trees already vast as clouds there I keep discovering beneath the tangle the ancient shaping of water to which the light of an hour comes back as to a secret and there I planted young palms in places I had not pondered until then I imagined their roots setting out in the dark knowing without knowledge I kept trying to see them standing in that bend of the valley in the light that would come A NIGHT FRAGRANCE Now I am old enough to remember people speaking of immortality as though it were something known to exist a tangible substance that might be acquired to be used perhaps in the kitchen every day in whatever was made there forever after and they applied the word to literature and the names of things names of persons and the naming of other things for them and no doubt they repeated that word with some element of belief when they named a genus of somewhat more than a hundred species of tropical trees and shrubs some with flowers most fragrant at night for James Theodore Tabernaemontanus of Heidelberg physician and botanist highly regarded in his day over four centuries ago immortality might be like that with the scattered species continuing their various evolutions the flowers opening by day or night with no knowledge of bearing a name of anyone and their fragrance if it reminds at all not reminding of him By W.S.

he knows What's in the heart of man There's a time to sleep time to be awake There's a time to work there's a time to play Time to laugh a time to cry Time to be born were all going to die Better watch \nwhat you say Cause you know he knows what's in the heart of man We all have sinned came short of the glory There's none righteous no not one If I say I have no sin call me a liar Better watch what you do cause he knows where you been Hand me down Religion He'd been saved all his life Been brought up on the lie His Father's Father reserved him a place On the front row of saving grace Said he couldn't kneel Cause his suit was too tight He been heard praying sometimes But he's never saw the light He got hand me down, hand me down Hand me down religion He said the church has no business Tampering with a man's soul Cause he swears their ain't no devil Down in no big black hole If the devil doesn't exist If he's a creation of man Then man created the devil In his own image with his own hands Had a cigar in his mouth But he said he didn't smoke Had shoes on his feet But you didn't see him walk Slung cards like throwing knives But you never saw them stick Carried a pearl handled pistol But you never heard the hammer click Said he don't go to church to be preached at He got hand me down religion Business as usual His mouth as dry as a sack of flour Dusty as a lizards back Sitting on the davenport Fishing a cufflinks from a crack He sported two bellies One high one low Held his pants with a diaper pen Never let his pride show Chorus Some say he had his own teeth But I seen him slip'em in and out Jackolantern smile With a head full of cabbage in his mouth Played his nose like harmonica Hair in need of an oil change Smoked ox blood through chicken bones Used god's name in vain Chorus birds nest portland hair He knew she was trailer park trash Barley sky gave him a Pumpernickel rash Chorus Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Heard the sound of rain Dripping from a tin roof into a can of lard Like a tad pole on a dry rivers bed Took a swim to the nearest star I would be president but I'm not without sin You rode the bus while I jumped the fence Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Lived in a shotgun house Close to the tracks Spray painted your name On the over pass Is there grace without gravity faith for the blind The barns are raising the devils killing time I was a writer before I could speak And I spoke before I could think I've stopped to hear a still small voice Giving me freedom Giving me a choice Between the devil and the deep blue sea With jaundiced eyes on the road to perdition Always kept his powder dry All is fair in love and war Pursuing the apple of his eye Between you, me and the lamppost She was dressed to the nines But she tired men with her idle chit chat Not one word worth a cold thin dime Between the devil and the deep blue sea Every cloud has a silver lining Every ocean has a green eyed monster Dyed in the wool and still shinning Feet of clay and a pair of purple valentines Gave him the slip on weaver's run She's running with the hair hunting with the hounds With a slender reed the cat's on the prowl She became penny wise and pound foolish Couldn't make a silk purse out of a sows ear Living in clover squeezing blood from a turnip In a blue funk crying crocodile tears Left no stone unturned smart as a whip More than one way to skin a cat Spit and polish spic and span Bull in the china shop is wearing a brass hat He bought her love for a song She couldn't see the forest for the tree's Half a loaf is better than none Bought a pig in a poke with a head full of steam Action speaks louder than words Cut off her nose with a fish hook to spit her face Heaping coals of fire upon her head She's a millstone around his neck She threw the baby out with the bath water And put bats in the belfry Hell is paved with good intentions And a month of sunday's Don't you judge the preacher Don't call me good, there's only one that's good Jesus came to save sinners of which I am the worst (Drums kick in) Don't you judge the preacher The preacher he is judge God called preaching folly So don't you hold a grudge If you don't have the faith You can't understand it If you have the faith Nothing left to explain I have died to sin Used to walk in these ways Truth are in the headlines At the bottom of a bird cage Had my oxen in a ditch Jesus wept Sunday's turning black The rocks cry out Road Less Traveled The snow fell like butterflies The air was bitter cold I crossed the sugar tree field Warmed my bones in a worm hole Fire by night cloud by day I don't regret one minute along the way When the evening sun Starts sinking low I count my many blessings upon the road Many lay by the way side Cuz the journey is long Lost in their aching heart is desire to move on Road less traveled Jesus lead me home Good morning mule skinner I'm going to move on Mocking bird be singing That I'm not alone When I enter that city paved with gold Pearly gates going to \nopen take me to my home Sky opened up Latter rain began to fall Ushering in the crops As the willows are tall Down by the waters course Remember from where I came Dip my hat in the pool I must be on my way The Last Song Make the Mississippi run backwards Flood waters are going to crest Going to flood the old devil Can't give him no rest The devil going to be running Like a Jack Rabbit out of New Orleans High tail'n it up north That's where he outta be Got to resist his temptations Stomp him under your feet Sun is going to shine on the cotton fields The day that ol' serpent leaves Don't drink from the devils troft He's the father of lies Leaving a trail on the river banks Swore I seen mud in his eye Greater is He that is in me Than he that is in the world Who'll bell the cat A boon companion Promised a chicken in every pot Feast or famine deep six or starve Burning the candle at both ends Crossed the rubicon Nervous tic pulled at the corner of his mouth Jumping like a big mouth bass down south Chorus Light at the end of the tunnel Became a runaway train Wearing jack boots like a gestapo When it pours it rains Fall on stony ground trampled under foot The fats in the fire cats on a hot tin roof Chorus Down at the beauty parlor They gave her a permanent fit Her hair looks like something You'd pound meat with Her hub cap eyes looked at him like a t-bone Like a wild horse stampede But he had loosed his demons And his spirit been set free One Man's Opinion Lost in the Canopy of tree's he never had horse sense Oaks and Pines cap off the skies he wandered through the circus tent Before the eyes of God tried squeezing through a needles eye The world is a small place every face tells a lie He drank a gallon of embalming fluid which kept him in the stir When your full of Helium best keep your shoes on and your thoughts pure Forest is a poachers paridise and the squirrels jumping from the tree's Nose as red as a tomato livers spotted with disease The way he plays the game it's never a game of chance Took him many a year to learn this side step dance It's a nice day but that's just One Man's Opinion Nosey Parker with her little acorn going to plant a mighty oak tree in her neighbors yard Weed benders always ready to run him out on the rail But the checker players like the tales he tells They seem to want bad news and they always want more He said he'll sleep it off and in the morning shove it under the door Who walked over his tongue with their muddy shoes Bending and twisting to shake the snapping turtle loose Never met Jesus the Son of man waking up civilized In the pine cones in Birmingham Concert in the Park recorded live 8-22-96 Ain't no Devil The fellow was familiar with Bulldogs and Water hoses With coat hanger shoulders and a silver spoon in his mouth With a pocket of fools gold Ingenuity and elbow grease He got a $50 Erie Root Canal Killed the pain with a bottle dipped from the Hudson Gave his liver an eviction note With corn rolls on his head like a big black widow He rode the stick horse derby mounted on a goat Readers Digest and a T.V. guide is all the bible he ever read Captain Marvel and Wonder Women the mom and dad he never had On a dark Kentucky night about to take a bullet in the back He saw Jesus standing there by the caution sign Ain't no devil in the fiery furnace in the burning bush In the lions den pushing this pen Going to raise the dead sleeping in my bed Going to open blind eyes can satisfy At the pearly gates walking on the lake On the mountain top going to steal and rob By the river side going to baptize Going to dry those eyes ain't no devil going to crash them skies It all came crashing down timber tumbled to the ground With a tobacco tan he climbed thin air Life's too short to box with God promised he would not spare the rod Surrendered to Jesus in the back of a Corvair Ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's all I have But sometimes she makes me sad When i'm tempted by her skin I got a girl she looks so fine But she wants too much of my time When i'm tempted by her hair Chorus I love Jesus more than I love you Cause he ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's first class But sometimes she goes too fast When i'm tempted by the speed If I plant a tree If I plant a tree today I may never sit under its shade But I look at the dirt on my hands And I wonder why God made man I hold my sons in my arms Could I send them away to war I see the trust in their eyes And I wander if God cries I look up at the stars And I wonder where you are Are you looking back down at me Your as far as the eye can see It must have been some sacrifice Ask your son to give his life There is no greater love that I know Cause a father don't want to let go Bombay taxi horn Looking classy in \nhis zoot suit Passing counterfeit bills and paste Backside numb in a water melon truck Couldn't wipe that smile off of his face He was as thin as a dollar bill Like a

only two ways to come out from the front on a stretcher or stiff in a flag draped trunk He was a fugitive long shore sailor Drifting with a bald headed friend Taking the jitney down broadway Trying to hide the whiskers on his chin The motel The day was long like a servant of hell Couldn't keep the flies away sweat dripping from the window seal Someone is coveting his brother's spanish wife Better cut the barrel short and sleep with a knife There are no picket fences in this dreary town Only bad guys, dirty cops, and dice throwing blood hounds Kiss the gunners daughter I heard someone scream A
