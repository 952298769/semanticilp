get more food per acre But you get less food per hour of work In economic terms, agriculture increases the returns to land, but decreases the returns to labor In a given area, agriculture can produce more food overall, and so feed more people But they have to work harder than before to survive There is an old idea that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of civilization Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around stored food, fields, canals, etc. may need to be defended In some particularly good environments, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places agriculture, on the other hand, allows people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Less mobile mothers don't have to carry their small children constantly, encouraging them to stop breast feeding sooner this shortens the period of reduced fertility due to breast feeding Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Agriculture also provides economic incentives to have more children Farming creates a greater demand for labor, that is, kids to help with the work So farmers tend to have large families, and the population tends to grow Soon they are locked in: people can't give up farming without causing hardship or starvation because there are more people than the available land could support by foraging So the shift to farming is to some extent a one-way change there is no going back without unacceptable disaster Agriculture and sedentism have surprising effects on nutrition and health agriculture, especially in its early stages, often focuses on one or a small number of the most productive crops this results in a less varied diet than foragers eat and often poorer nutrition overall more carbohydrates lead to more dental caries (cavities), abscesses, etc. - a serious matter before modern dentistry more labor leads to more arthritis and other wear-and-tear ailments living in permanent villages creates new problems of sanitation (waste disposal, insect infestation, etc.) that encourage disease living in larger groups aids the spread of epidemic diseases ovarall, settled agricultural lifestyles typically increase biological stress on people and often decrease lifespan more children are produced, but they have a shorter life expectancy in theory, these two trends could cancel each other out but the observed pattern is that in most or all cases, the net effect is still a population increase Agriculture and sedentism have cultural effects, too: Agriculture requires investment of labor to make a plot of land productive land that has been cleared, tilled, etc. is more valuable than the rest of the countryside so people will tend to claim ownership of improved land, and become tied to it for at least a season, and often longer Sedentism allows accumulation of material goods: storage of goods and food thus the origins of rich and poor people and classes so sedentism makes economic stratification possible accumulation is not limited to a single generation,

time, the likelihood that the dieter will gain weight is high Physiological defenses against weight loss, such as a lowering of basal metabolic rate, a slowing of gastric motility, and fatigue, are aimed at decreasing the body's need for energy and enhancing its ability to absorb energy from food Dieting can lead to weight gain due to reduced need for energy and increased ability to absorb energy from food The problem with frequent dieting Frequent dieting attempts may further complicate weight management Research shows that regained weight is often fat If the dieter is attempting to weigh a particular number, the increase in fat stores may be at the expense of muscle tissue, which is more metabolically active than fat tissue As a result, the metabolic needs of the frequent dieter decrease over time due to the numerous dieting attempts and weight cycles, and this can result in weight gain Weight management: An alternative to dieting Adopting more effective and reasonable approaches to weight management offers the best outlook for physical and psychological health Learning to reduce health risk by engaging in weight management, not dieting, seems the most appropriate course of action According to the American Dietetic Association, &quot;weight management&quot; is defined as the adoption of healthful and sustainable eating and exercise behaviors indicated for reduced disease risk and improved feelings of energy and well-being Modest changes regarding eating and exercise habits can result in small, maintainable weight change These changes, when maintained

Rework costs increased because production problems were caught Increased downtime to investigate and correct production problems Company is more diligent in finding cost effective ways to manage the program Employees work more efficiently and have greater awareness of food safety There are tighter food safety controls and more reliable product quality There are a reduced number of customer complaints B Training costs include teaching English and underwriting Graduate Equivalence Degree programs because HACCP requires reading, writing, and communicating in English Capital costs associated with improved control measures (but these costs are low) Time added for HACCP verification audits and reports Plant is more efficient, has better control over its process, can trace back problems faster, and has fewer hold-ups in the work line which result in less down time and less product being discarded Employees have greater awareness of the reasons for various process control procedures Improved on-time delivery because of fewer production hold-ups Less likelihood of recalls and lawsuits, and better protection for the brand name Satisfy customers who insist upon HACCP

600 person-hours of additional management time required Three-fold reduction in customer complaints \nindicating greater customer satisfaction Improved employee awareness of food safety needs Program
