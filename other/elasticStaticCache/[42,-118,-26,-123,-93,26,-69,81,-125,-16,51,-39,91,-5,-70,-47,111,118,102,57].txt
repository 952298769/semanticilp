respiration is to supply the body with adequate oxygen and to remove CO 2 This process is achieved through 3 distinct mechanisms Ventilation The delivery of ambient air to the alveoli where it is exposed to blood Diffusion The movement of O 2 and CO 2 across the alveolar capillary wall barriers Circulation The method by which O 2 is carried from the site of gas exchange to the cells of the body where active metabolism occurs The accomplish these tasks, the respiratory system functions as a pump for effective ventilation and as an area of gas exhange (Figure 1) Respiratory failure is best described as the inability of the respiratory system to maintain adequate gas exhange Failure of the respiratory system to perform optimally in either of these two roles as a pump or as an area of gas exhange will result in hypercarbia and hypoxemia, respectively, as parameters of system failure Hence respiratory failure is defined as impaired gas exchange;",1.2065808773040771],["It relates
