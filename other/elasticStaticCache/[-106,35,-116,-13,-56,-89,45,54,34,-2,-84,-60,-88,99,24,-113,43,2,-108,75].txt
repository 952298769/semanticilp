Climate is the general term for the long-term pattern of weather conditions Continental Climate is a type of climate which has a large range between the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures, and is usually found toward the center of large land masses Convectional Precipitation is a type of precipitation that occurs when moist air, warmed by the surface of the ground, rises, cools, and cannot hold the moisture which falls as precipitation Convergence Zone is an area of the Earth at which air masses converge in the lower atmosphere, such as the Polar Front and the Intertropical Convergence Zone Coriolis Effect is a force which deflects moving ojects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, and which is brought on by the rotation of the earth from west to east Degree Days is an indicator for the growing season for plants measured by the difference between the mean daily temperature and the plant growth temperature of 5.5 degrees C Fahrenheit is a type of temperature scale which uses 212 degrees for boiling and 32 degrees for freezing of water Frost Free Period is a value which indictaes the total number of days between the last expected frost in the spring and the first expected frost in the fall Growing Season is an indicator for the number of days in the year with an average temperature above 5.5 degrees C Hythergraph is a type of graph which has monthly temperatures plotted on a grid against monthly precipitation Isotherm is a type of isoline which joins points of equal temperature Maritime Climate is a type of climate which is strongly influenced by closeness to the ocean, with an annual temperature range that tends to be small and a precipitation that is high Monsoon is a term for seasonal winds which reverse their direction with the seasons bringing wet and dry conditions depending on their directions Polar Climatic Zone is an area of the earth which is north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle, having cool or cold temperatures all year Rainshadow is a climatic term for the dry area on the leeward side of a land mass Temperate Climatic Zone is an area of the earth which is between 23 1/2 degrees and 66 1/2 degrees north and south, having warm or hot summers and cool or cold winters Temperature is an element of climate which measures the degree of heat or cold in the atmosphere Temperature Index is a comparative value which indicates the number of degrees above or below a base temperature, such as a long-term average Tropical Climatic Zone is an area of the earth
