[["ImportanceAll living things need materials to live. These materials come from the environment.Organisms get nutrients, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and energy from their environments.Nutrients are used for growth, repair, and energy. Plants get their nutrients and water from thesoil. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air. They obtain energy directly from the sun. Sunlightis the source of energy that fuels most life on Earth. They then use sunlight and carbon dioxide tomake food for energy. Animals get nutrients and energy from eating plants. Some animals alsoobtain energy by eating other animals.

Organisms use energy to move, grow, reproduce, and more. Organisms also need materials to build and repair their bodies. In almost all ecosystems, the energy in the ecosystem comes from sunlight. Producers, such as plants and algae, get their energy directly from sunlight, and get the materials they need from air and water. Consumers get their energy and materials by eating other organisms. Ecologists classify consumers based on what kinds of organisms they eat: herbivores eat producers; carnivores eat other animals; omnivores eat both producers and animals; decomposers get their energy and materials from droppings and dead organisms. When a consumer eats another organism, it never gets all of the energy that organism has taken in. Some of the energy has already been used by the organism being eaten and some is left in body parts that canâ€™t be eaten. For this reason, there is less and less energy available as you move up in an ecosystem from producers, to herbivores, to omnivores and carnivores. Because of this, in almost any ecosystem there are fewer herbivores than producers, and fewer carnivores than herbivores. Ecologists make diagrams such as food chains and food webs to help make clear what eats what in an ecosystem.",1.6144918203353882],["We get that energy from food, from water, from air, etc.",1.4888577461242676],["We get that  energy  from food , from water , from air , etc.",1.4888577461242676],["Repair leaky faucets and toilets Moderately priced solutions = moderate energy savings: Get a professional energy audit to determine sources of air infiltration.",1.477283239364624],["X1021440477-00121-28123</DOCNO> Peak Reductions from Duct and Appliance Repairs - Energy Efficiency Project Report Getting It Right the Second Time: Measured Savings and Peak Reduction From Duct and Appliance Repairs Paper Presented at ACEEE 1992 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings Report Dated: 1992 By: John Proctor and Ronald Pernick Abstract This paper reports on potential energy and peak savings in residential air conditioners, heat pumps and gas forced air furnaces.",1.471953272819519],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Animals essentially receive their energy from the air they breathe, the water they drink, and from the plants and other animals they eat.",1.4457870721817017],["Regional mass transit systems provide convenient, reliable transportation within urban growth regions and dramatically reduce energy consumption, air pollution and the cost of getting to and from work.",1.425066590309143],["Regional mass transit systems provide convenient, reliable transportation within urban growth regions and dramatically reduce energy consumption, air pollution and the cost of getting to and from work.",1.425066590309143],["Duct maintenance and repair Typical duct systems lose energy from your heating and air-conditioning equipment.",1.4153167009353638],["Energy efficient upgrades run the gamut from repairs to the air conditioning unit to double-glazed windows.",1.4153167009353638],["We welcome questions ranging from mechanical repairs to indoor air quality and energy conservation.",1.4153167009353638]]
