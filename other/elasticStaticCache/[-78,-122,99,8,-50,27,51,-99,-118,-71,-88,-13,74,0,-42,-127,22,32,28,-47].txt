here and new homeowners are very enthused about beautifying their new home with trees, shrubs and a lawn. Developing a home landscape plan can be fun but requires a lot of hard labor and patience as plants, especially trees, grow to maturity.  When it comes to trees for new home yards and farmsteads we tend to prefer those that grow fast. Years ago, we looked to the Siberian Elm to fulfill growth expectations. Many were planted in field shelterbelts, around farmsteads and homes. It took about 20 years to realize this tree does not live very long. Although it has some drought tolerance, its life span is reduced when little moisture is received. Those who planted this tree also found it was susceptible to attacks of certain insects and very susceptible to phenoxy herbicides like 2,4-D and canker.  After we learned Siberian Elm was not the tree we thought it should be, we turned to the hybrid poplars for that fast growth. Indeed, it did grow very well for about 10 years but we learned most will be dead before they reach 20 years of age. Upon moving to our new home 20+ years ago, we hand planted many northwest poplar trees, occasionally giving them supplemental water.  As the trees approached 15-20 feet their leaves began to turn color and drop pre-maturely. By late August many were devoid of leaves. Attempts were made to provide water but we could not keep up. Today, just a few remain but they too are struggling. By the end of this summer I expect only two of the original 24 trees will be around to experience next winter.  Besides the high water requirement, hybrid poplars are often attacked by gall mites, cytospora canker, stem decay, and wetwood.  When folds ask for my thoughts or suggestions on fast growing trees, hybrid poplars usually become part of the discussion. Obviously they are not popular with me. However, they do have a place in situations where other longer-living trees that have lower water requirements can be planted nearby and the property owner is prepared to remove the declining poplars as they reach 10-20 years of age.  The Extension Service of North Dakota State University has published a neat handbook “Trees and Shrubs for Northern Great Plains Landscapes”. It contains pictures, descriptions, etc. of the major species of trees and shrubs to consider for planting in the Northern Great Plains.

Some plants, such as the Canada thistle and most bamboos, send out long underground stems that produce new plants, often at considerable distances from the original plant. Such plants can form enormous colonies of new plants within a relatively few years. Many trees, such as the beech and aspen, send up root sprouts, and large colonies of new trees thus arise. In other trees, the lower branches may produce roots where they rest upon the ground, and new trees are produced. The leaves of some plants produce buds at their edges, which develop in turn into miniature plants that fall off and take root. Specialists in the fields of agriculture and horticulture take advantage of the regenerative ability of plants through such techniques as the rooting of cuttings; grafting and budding of fruit trees; layering, or inducing the tips of branches to produce new plants; the cutting apart of clusters of perennials perennial, any plant that under natural conditions lives for several to many growing seasons, as contrasted to an annual or a biennial. Botanically, the term perennial Advantages and Disadvantages of Vegetative Propagation Advantages The offsprings are genetically identical and therefore advantageous traits can be preserved. Only one parent is required which eliminates the need for special mechanisms such as pollination, etc. It is faster. For example, bacteria can multiply every 20 minutes. This helps the organisms to increase in number at a rapid rate that balances the loss in number due to various causes. Many plants are able to tide over unfavourable conditions. This is because of the presence of organs of asexual reproduction like the tubers, corm, bulbs, etc. Vegetative propagation is especially beneficial to the agriculturists and horticulturists. They can raise crops like bananas, sugarcane, potato, etc that do not produce viable seeds. The seedless varieties of fruits are also a result of vegetative propagation. The modern technique of tissue culture can be used to grow virus-free plants. Disadvantages The plants gradually lose their vigour as there is no genetic variation. They are more prone to diseases that are specific to the species. This can result in the destruction of an entire crop. Since many plants are produced, it results in overcrowding and lack of nutrients.",1.302310585975647],["Most springtails feed on funguses, organisms that include mushrooms, mold, and yeast.
