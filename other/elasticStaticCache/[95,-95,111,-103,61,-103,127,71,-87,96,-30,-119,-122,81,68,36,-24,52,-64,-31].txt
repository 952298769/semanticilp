couldn't do today Black Celebration Black Celebration Tonight To celebrate the fact That we've seen the back Of another black day I look to you And your strong belief Me, I want relief Tonight Consolation I want so much Want to feel your touch Tonight Take me in your arms Forgetting all you couldn't do today Black Celebration I'll drink to that Black Celebration Tonight Fly on the Windscreen Death is everywhere There are flies on the windscreen For a start Reminding us We could be torn apart Tonight Death is everywhere There are lambs for the slaughter Waiting to die And I can sense The hours slipping by Tonight Come here Kiss me Now Come here Kiss me Now Death is everywhere The more I look The more I see The more I feel A sense of urgency Tonight Come here (touch me) Kiss me (touch me) Now (touch me) (touch me) There are flies on the windscreen There are lambs for the slaughter There are flies on the windscreen Come here (touch me) Kiss me (touch me) Now (touch me) (touch me) Come here (touch me) Kiss me (touch me) Now (touch me) (touch me) A Question of Lust Fragile Like a baby in your arms Be gentle with me I'd never willingly Do you harm Apologies Are all you seem to get from me But just like a child You make me smile When you care for me And you know It's a question of lust It's a question of trust It's a question of not letting What we've built up Crumble to dust It is all of these things and more That keep us together Independence Is still important for us though (we realise) It's easy to make The stupid mistake Of letting go (do you know what I mean) My weaknesses You know each and every one (it frightens me) But I need to drink More than you seem to think Before I'm anyone's And you know It's a question of lust It's a question of trust It's a question of not letting What we've built up Crumble to dust It is all of these things and more That keep us together Kiss me goodbye When I'm on my own But you know that I'd Rather be home It's a question of lust Sometimes Sometimes Only sometimes I question everything And I'm the first to admit If you catch me in a mood like this I can be tiring Even embarrassing But you must Feel the same When you look around You can't tell me honestly You're happy with what you see Oh sometimes Only sometimes You must be You must be As embarrassing as me Sometimes It Doesn't Matter Two As I lay here with you The shame lies with us We talk of love and trust That doesn't matter Though we may be the last in the world We feel like pioneers Telling hopes and fears To one another And oh what a feeling Inside of me It might last for an hour Wounds aren't healing Inside of me Though it feel good now I know it's only for now The feeling is intense You grip me with your eyes And then I realise It doesn't matter A Question of Time I've got to get to you first Before they do It's just a question of time Before they lay their hands on you And make you just like the rest I've got to get to you first It's just a question of time Well now you're only fifteen And you look good I'll take you under my wing Somebody should They've persuasive ways And you'll believe what they say It's just a question of time \nIt's running out for you It won't be long until you'll do Exactly what they want you to I can see them now Hanging around To mess you up To strip you down And have their fun With my little one It's just a question of time It's running out for you It won't be long until you'll do Exactly what they want you to Sometimes I don't blame them For wanting you You look good And they need something to do Until I look at you And then I condemn them I know my kind What goes on in our minds It's just a question of time It should be better It's just a question of time It should be better with you It's just a question of time Stripped Come with me Into the trees We'll lay on the grass And let the hours pass Take my hand Come back to the land Let's get away Just for one day Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Metropolis Has nothing on this You're breathing in fumes I taste when we kiss Take my hand Come back to the land Where everything's ours For a few hours Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Let me hear you Make decisions Without your television Let me hear you speaking Just for me Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Let me hear you speaking Just for me Let me see you Stripped down to the bone Let me hear you crying Just for me Here is the House Here is the house
