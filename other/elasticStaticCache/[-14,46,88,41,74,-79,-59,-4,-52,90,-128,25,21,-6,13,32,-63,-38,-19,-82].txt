to African green monkey virus Etiology of the disease Affected individuals have no resistance to infection Rarely survive more than a few years, die of otherwise nonlethal diseases Transfer of body fluids poses most significant threat Incidence growing rapidly Clinical symptoms do not develop until after long period \nof latency How HIV compromises the immune system Normally a series of cells patrols bloodstream for invaders These cells are destroyed in AIDS patients, most specifically T4 cells The HIV infection cycle fig 30.9 Attachment HIV infects only T4 cells fig 30.10 Infects T4 cell by recognizing glycoprotein surface marker HIV glycoprotein precisely fits CD4 protein on T4 surface Cells lacking CD4 cannot be infected Entry Penetrates cell membrane, enters cell via endocytosis Protein coat shed Replication Single strand RNA with reverse transcriptase enzyme inside cell Viral RNA made into double-stranded DNA via reverse transcriptase Double-stranded DNA inserts itself into chromosomes of T4 cell Infected cell can remain latent or become active Latent cell: incorporates viral DNA into cell genome Active cell: virus directs production of copies of its genome Cell dies and

Ultraviolet radiation Chemicals and carcinogens Other kinds of viruses Retroviruses (HIV) contain both RNA and reverse transcriptase Other viruses (cold virus) contain RNA but not reverse transcriptase Work without enzyme by using host's ribosomes and using RNA like mRNA Other viruses contain DNA: herpesviruses (cold sores and genital herpes), papillomaviruses (warts) Viruses: Particles of Genomes Origin as fragments of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes explains diversity New forms of viruses are evolving continuously THE BACTERIA Bacteria Are a Unique Group of Living Organisms Represent the oldest form of life fig 4.11 Only representatives of the prokaryotes Used to be classified as the only member of the kingdom Monera Present classification identifies two kingdoms of bacteria Archaebacteria Eubacteria Bacteria Are an Extremely Diverse Group of Organisms fig 30.11 Few major structural differences Species differentiation based on metabolic processes Characterized by growth on certain defined media Activities altered by growth conditions and chemicals Role of Bacteria Responsible for creating properties of atmosphere and soils Are autotrophic, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic, contribute to world carbon balance Are heterotrophic and break down organic compounds Only a few genera of bacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen Involved in industrial processes and chemical syntheses Produce acetic acid, vinegar, amino acids, enzymes Production of various milk products, bread and ethanol Antibiotics derived from bacterial sources Genetic engineering applications PROKARYOTES VERSUS EUKARYOTES Structural Differences Multicellularity: bacteria are fundamentally single-celled fig 30.11e, 12 May adhere within matrix, some form filaments Few integrated activities between cells Primitive colonial forms include gliding bacteria fig 30.11d Cell size: extremely small individual cell size Chromosomes: non-membrane bound DNA is circular and lacks proteins Cell division and genetic recombination Simple division via binary fission True sexual reproduction absent, genetic recombination irregular Internal compartmentalization: Lack membrane-bound organelles Enzymes are bound to cell membrane Only organelles present are ribosomes Flagella: possess simple flagella fig 30.1a,c,13 Composed of single flagellin fiber Lack 9 + 2 structure of eukaryotic flagella and cilia fig 5.26 Flagellar motion resembles spinning propeller, not whip-like motion Metabolic Diversity: Eukaryotes exhibit only one form of photosynthesis Bacteria exhibit several patterns of photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic Bacteria undergo chemosynthesis and fix atmospheric nitrogen BACTERIAL STRUCTURE Cell Wall Structure Polysaccharide network with polypeptide crosslinks fig 30.14 Classed as gram-positive or gram-negative Gram-positive composed of polysaccharide network Gram-negative have additional lipopolysaccharide chains Gram-negative are less susceptible to antibiotics May be surrounded by gelatinous capsule General Morphology Cell shape Rod-shaped: bacilli Spherical: cocci Spirally coiled: spirilla Some form stalked structures that give rise to spores fig 30.11d After division individual cells may adhere forming chains Cyanobacteria regularly form large filamentous masses fig 30.12 Connected by outer walls or gelatinous sheaths May exhibit coordinated gliding or rotational movements Rigid, helical flagella composed of flagellin protein fig 5.8 Hairlike pili function in attachment and identification fig 30.13 Thick-walled endospores fig 30.15 Resistant to desiccation Resistant to heat, killed only by extremely high temperatures BACTERIAL VARIATION Mutation One in 200 bacteria will have mutant characteristics fig 30.16 Many mutants result from great number of individual cells Rapid multiplication in short time period Increase number with favorable mutations Rapidly changes characteristics of a population Plays important role in genetic diversity Example: development of antibiotic resistance Genetic Recombination Transfer of genes via viruses, plasmids, other DNA fragments Examples Rapid transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids Transfer of pathogenic characteristics among enteric bacteria Rapid generation time is an alternative evolutionary strategy BACTERIA AS PLANT PATHOGENS Cause Costly Plant Diseases Symptoms are generally spots on stems, leaves or fruit Include blights, soft rots and wilts Most pathogens are rod-shaped pseudomonads fig 30.11a Example: Citrus Canker Caused by pseudomonad Xanthomonas campestris Introduced from abroad, causes serious economical damage in Florida BACTERIA AS HUMAN PATHOGENS Cause Many Human Diseases tbl 30.1 Examples: cholera, leprosy, tetanus, bacterial pneumonia, whooping cough, diphtheria Generally related to one of several genera Streptococcus: pneumonia, scarlet and rheumatic fevers fig 30.1b Staphylococcus: cause widespread infections Many bacterial diseases spread through food or water Insect vectors spread diseases like typhus Humans can contract disease from drinking cow milk, causes brucellosis in animals Tuberculosis One-third of all people worldwide infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Eight million new cases each year, three million deaths Leading cause of death from a single infectious agent Eradication programs dismantled in U.S. in 1980's Experiencing a dramatic resurgence of the disease Complicated by social factors, declining public health infrastructure Associated with prevalence of HIV Multidrug resistant strains of TB are developing Dental Caries Causes tooth decay and cavities Dental plaque composed of bacteria and polysaccharide matrix Involves many species of bacteria High sugar diets harmful Bacteria convert sugars to lactic acid Acid destroys hard tissue of tooth Control via fluoride by retarding loss of calcium Sexually Transmitted Diseases STDs caused by bacteria and viruses Viral STDs have no cure Bacterial STDs \nfrequently mutate to drug-resistant strains Gonorrhea Most prevalent communicable disease, cause by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium Transmitted during sexual activities through transfer of body fluids Can spread to eyes (conjunctivitis) and internal organs, cause arthritic meningitis Symptoms in women and men are generally mild and go unnoticed Treatment via combination of antibiotics Syphilis Less common as a result of blood-screening procedures and antibiotic treatment Caused by spirochaete bacterium, Treponema palladum Transmitted during intercourse, direct contact with sore or from mother to fetus Disease progresses in four distinct stages Primary stage characterized by chancre sore, highly infectious stage Secondary stage distinguished by body rash Third stage shows no symptoms, may last years Fourth stage is heart disease, mental deficiency, nerve damage, loss of motor functions, blindness Treated via antibiotics Genital herpes Caused by two types of closely related viruses Herpes simplex Type 1 causes cold sores and fever blisters Herpes simplex type 2 causes genital lesions of genital herpes Transmitted through sexual contact when open sores are evident Herpes virus in body travels along nerve endings to base of spine May remain dormant with no symptoms May become active and produce painful symptoms Initial outbreak produces measle-like lesions, flu-like symptoms May become dormant, outbreaks reappear with stress or exposure to sun Antiviral drugs can lessen severity of outbreaks, not a cure Transmission possible during outbreaks Chlamydia \"Silent STD\" caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium Has both bacterial and viral characteristics Susceptible to antibiotics like bacterium Depends on host cell to replicate, like virus Transmitted via sexual intercourse Women usually do not experience symptoms until infection is established Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease Can lead to sterility, increase risk of acquiring HIV Symptoms in men include watery discharge, burning or itching Tests exist to identify bacteria in discharge Treatment via antibiotics mostly tetracycline, penicillin not effective Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Transmission through contact with infected person fig 30.17 More than 30 strains, three known to cause cervical cancer Warts appear in genital region three weeks to three months after exposure Treatment through various agents to remove warts Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Archaebacteria are distinctly different from all other bacteria Base sequences of rRNA virtually identical in all members Differ from sequences in other bacteria and eukaryotes Cell walls lack muramic acid Have distinctive membranes, unusual cell walls, unique metabolic cofactors Capable of living in anaerobic atmosphere rich in CO2 and H2 Include oldest life forms, ancestral to Eubacteria and eukaryotes Independent evolution of each group Some have ribosomes similar to eukaryotes Others have smaller ribosomes like Eubacteria Include methanogens that produce methane gas Produce marsh gas, natural gas and reduce elemental sulfur Produce own anaerobic environment, cannot function in presence of oxygen Include other bacteria able to survive in inhospitable environments Thermoacidophiles Hot springs, deep sea thermal vents Use hydrogen sulfide as energy source Halophiles Salt-loving bacteria Use salt to generate ATP SIMPLE BUT VERSATILE ORGANISMS Simple Organisms with Diverse Metabolisms First
