circumscribes the continents accounts for less than 10% of the earth's land surface but about 2/3 of the population Swell waves in the offshore, created as wind shear stress is applied to the ocean, represent the transmission of energy but not mass, i.e. the ocean surface swells as the crests of waves pass by wave length and height depend on wind velocity duration of wind from a constant direction fetch: the length of water over which the wind is passing therefore the large, long duration storms produce the largest waves, typically 15 m in height , but up to 34 m Surf breaking waves in the shorezone (foreshore) as waves drag on the sea floor in the foreshore, the waves decelerate becoming asymmetric , with short wave length and greater height ( i.e. ), until they are unstable and break to form surf Coastal processes erosion hydraulic action force of waves and trapped air rock is plucked from headlands attrition reduction of particle size as clasts bounce in the surf abrasion (corrasion) erosion as clasts as cast against headlands longshore drift movement of nearshore sediment parallel to the shore wave refraction waves conform to the sea bottom topography , that is, decelerate first opposite the headlands and bend around them into the bays wave energy is concentrated on headlands and diverges in the bays wave refraction also generates a longshore drift of water and sediment from the breaking waves at the headlands to the lower water in the adjacent bays erosion on headlands and deposition in bays causes coastlines to become less irregular over geologic time storm surges thus during storms (high wind shear), large waves pass through elevated sea levels (low atmospheric pressure) and break in the backshore low pressure is common over the oceans in winter (the water is warmer than land), so winter wave erosion can remove the sand from beaches, where it is stored offshore and returned to shore with lower wave energy that favours deposition seismic (not
