identify the parts and materials that comprise simple objects and how they are connected (e.g. disassemble common household objects) Predict the effect of removing or exchanging parts of an object (e.g. a mechanical toy, a jigsaw puzzle) Discuss how parts when put together can do things that they could not do by themselves Assemble a commercial product using manufacturer's instructions (e.g. Legos, plastic models) Design and build a simple device with a desired function from accessible materials Describe or demonstrate how something may not work well if a part is missing, broken, worn
