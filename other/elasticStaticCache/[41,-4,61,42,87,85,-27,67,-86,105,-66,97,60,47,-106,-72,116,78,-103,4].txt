development is direct to a juvenile form - doesn&#146;t go through a larval form and metamorphosis order Caudata - salamanders, newts (with tail) lizard-like in appearance many are entirely aquatic never having a terrestrial phase some retain juvenile characteristics (gills) even as reproductively mature adults - condition known as paedomorphosis most salamanders use internal fertilization, lay eggs and have external development with a larval stage the larval stage looks like the adult, there isn&#146;t a prevalent tadpole stage of development the larva have external gills and a finned tail - the gills are lost upon metamorphosis order Anura - frogs and toads (no tail) the typical amphibian life cycle is exemplified most often in frogs eggs are laid and fertilized externally and develop rapidly into tadpole larvae tadpoles live and grow from 6 months to 2 years before metamorphosing into young froglets which will continue to grow and become sexually mature adults within 1-2 years tadpoles are omnivorous - eat insects, insect larvae, other aquatic eggs, smaller fish and amphibian larvae and plants - algae, mosses, aquatic plants frogs have developed hind limbs specialized for swimming (webbed feet) and leaping most frogs and toads secrete thick mucus from glands in their skin when alarmed many times these secretions smell and taste bad to predators many are poisonous - poison arrow frog of the tropics most secretions contain antimicrobial compounds - magainins (studied in our chem dept many frogs and salamanders too, have chromatophores which allow them to darken or lighten their skin tone which helps with camouflage against stream/pond bottoms or in terrestrial settings - leaves etc. studies of frog and axolotl (salamander) embryos have been the most instrumental in understanding how vertebrate embryogenesis works eggs are large and easily accessible and manipulated have learned how the mesodermal germ layer is specified by the interactions of ectoderm and endoderm have learned how the A-P, D-V and L-R axis form in vertebrates have learned how neurulation takes place have learned how many organ systems originate back to top Chordata Part IV: Reptiles Prevention of egg desiccation critical to leaving aquatic environment completely alteration in development to form special membranes around the developing embryo these membranes are called the amnion, chorion and allantois reptile, bird and mammal embryos form these membranes during embryogenesis these animals are collectively known as amniotes anatomical characteristics allowing division of the amniotes (especially important for paleontology) anatomical structures of the skull allow us to identify three early offshoots from the first amniotic animals anapsids skull has only a depression for the eye socket synapsids skull has a single depression in addition to the eye socket posterior to eye diapsids two additional cavities in the skull posterior and dorsally to eye socket reptiles are represented by two of these divisions - the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta) and the shell itself this advancement allowed the early amniotes to become independent of water for reproduction and successfully invade a terrestrial environment Characteristics of a reptile - distinction from amphibians dermis produces a scaly epidermis which is sometimes shed in some bony plates are produced (turtles, crocodilians) 5 digits on limbs respiration totally by lungs - no gills during development direct development - no larval stage a copulatory organ for internal fertilization all but crocodilians have 3 chambered hearts Class Reptilia Subclass Anapsida - Order Testudines - turtles little changed since they first appear in the fossil record - later Triassic - before the large dinosaurs only living example of anapsids shell is formed from outgrowth of the vertebrae, ribs and sternum dorsal part is carapace, ventral is plastron turtles are one of the few reptiles which have gone back to a marine environment they in fact must go back to land to lay their eggs \nsex determination in turtles is temperature dependent low temperature produces males, high females female can regulate this by depth she buries eggs Subclass Diapsida - order Squamata - squame is a skin scale - lizards and snakes suborder Sauria - lizards lizards show the most modifications and adaptations to their body forms to suit their ecological niche there are legless lizards chameleons use chromatophores to change color for camouflage and moods chameleons also have turret eyes, which can be controlled independently the non-glandular, scaly epidermis which prevents water loss has allowed lizards and snakes to thrive in many arid environments suborder Serpentes - snakes limbs and limb girdles have been lost except for in some of the boa constrictors and pythons many have evolve poisonous venom for use in capturing prey also evolved fangs for delivery of that venom poisonous snakes 2 types with or without fangs with long retractable fangs - viperidae - vipers (adders), pit vipers (rattlesnake, cottonmouth) with short stationary fangs - elapidae - cobras, coral snakes 2 type of venoms neurotoxins - paralyze hemolytic toxins - degrade blood, blood vessels and tissue causing hemorrhaging snakes can not hear sound,
