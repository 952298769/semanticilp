simply along a gentle curve&#44; which emphasises the form of their bodies&#46; As it is a circular panel&#44; the background is laid to the circumference which echoes the composition of the fish circling around each other&#46; When designing mosaics to be seen underwater we take into consideration the effects that reflection from the water surface will have on the piece&#46; The movement of the water will add to the animation of the design but it is important that the execution is bold and contains high contrast so that it will read clearly under water&#46; Another property of water to consider is the way in which the side walls of a pool appear to shrink to a fraction of their size&#46; This makes them unsuitable areas for decoration as a design would be distorted beyond recognition Please click here for a larger image Cones Commission This mosaic has two main areas of interest &#45; surface and balance&#46; The textural surface does the same thing across the whole design&#46; Marble cubes have been cut an used for their riven face to echo the shape of smalti&#46; The design is divided into two halves&#46; One half shows an intensely coloured pair of cones&#44; while the other is divided into two sets of cones&#44; one on top of an another&#46; This shape is potentially clumsy and weighty and couild easily become overbearing&#46; The mosaic is really an exercise in making these two sides balance&#46; The complex shapes on one side are balanced by the brightness of colour on the other&#46; The intense shininess of the red and orange smalti is counterweighted by the light&#45;absorbent&#44; black marble&#46; The lively linear top to the orange cone is balanced by the pattern of white and grey marble which runs in a band across the centre of the more complex form Please click here for a larger image Zogu Commission This is a portrait of Zogu&#44; an Albanian warlord who was the father of King Zog&#46; It was taken from a 19th century

echoes the intense stares of the Byzantine mosaic portraits&#46; Please click here for a larger image Mosaic Fireplace An unused domestic fireplace is here enlivened by the use of intensely coloured glass mosaic&#46; The piece is about pattern and colour and refers to the type of distortions and colour variations seen in woven textiles&#46; Although it is not symmetrical&#44; pattern emerges from the repetition of forms&#44; colours and shapes&#46; With no formula for the way the pattern is laid&#44; care has been taken to ensure that the shapes&#44; tones and colours balance throughout&#46;

an important element in both the design and execution of a piece&#46; Grout lines set up pattern and rhythm &#59; straight ones create a structured formal effect&#44; while curved lines suggest
