like mid-latitude cyclones, hurricanes develop around depressions in the pressure surface, but in this case the depression is deeper and spread out over a smaller area - this results in an especially steep slope for the air to descend, thus causing extremely high wind speeds ( in excess of 150 km/hour ) - the high wind speeds in themselves are sufficient reason to obey warnings to leave an area which may be in the path of a hurricane, particularly in view of the fact that one of the lessons learned from Hurricane Andrew ( South Florida, July 1992 ) is that tornadoes are often carried within a hurricane system - tornado winds are strong enough to drive solid objects through solid objects: for a number of years after Hurricane Andrew, a palm tree near Homestead, Florida was observed to have a piece of wood stuck through the centre of its trunk, a trunk which could just as easily have been a human body - another reason to leave the area, particulary a coastal area, is the set-up of water along the coastline by hurricane winds, which results in wave damage and extensive flooding - considerable loss of life has resulted in countries like Bangladesh due to the inability to move large numbers of people away from coastal areas during times of hurricane or, as they are called in that part of the world, cyclones, typhoons and willie willies ( the latter is Australian, mate ) - on October 16, 1954 Hurricane Hazel struck Toronto - actually, it was not a hurricane so much as a reinforced mid-latitude cyclone, a phenomenon which was identified in a recent popular movie The Perfect Storm - Hurricane Hazel had landed along the North Carolina coast and was already in the process of dying, as hurricanes do once they move inland to be cut off from the heat and moisture of the ocean, or as happens when they move toward the cold waters of the Labrador Current, which flows over the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap, off Newfoundland - however, this dying tropical cyclone met up with a vigorous mid-latitude cyclone and, in so doing, found new life as a kind of super mid-latitude storm: Toronto s own version of the perfect storm - it wasn t the wind so much as the rain: within the space of 48 hours, the equivalent of two months of rain had fallen in the Humber River Valley and the Humber River could not handle it - extensive valley flooding literally wiped out people who were settled there, accounting for the loss of 60 lives, far more than were lost in the sinking of the Andrea Gayle, though equally trajic - one of the legacies of that storm has been to discourage settlement of river valley bottom lands in the Toronto area, designating them instead as park and conservation land;",1.1620357036590576],["As they move ashore, they bring with them a storm surge of ocean water along the coastline, high winds, tornadoes, torrential rains and flooding.",1.1409046649932861],["The county has a history of tornadoes, direct line winds and a term used to describe a storm in March 1997, as a gust-tornado.",1.13892662525177],["There will be floods, strong winds, tornadoes and severe storms in America.",1.1379708051681519],["Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspout * Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspouts Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that \nform over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["There is a tornado called a waterspout that is weak and forms over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Waterspout * Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.",1.1206789016723633],["Advices will describe the most likely weather phenomena (i.e. large hail, strong winds, tornadoes or torrential rain) that will accompany the storms.",1.0967755317687988],["Tornado damage is caused by extremely strong winds and by the reduced pressure in the funnel's center, which has been known to cause structures to explode.",1.0876319408416748],["X1014302287-00220-47317</DOCNO> Page Title National Weather Service, Newport, NC Volume 8, Number1 (&#35;30) February-May, 2001 Tornado Facts A tornado is a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground The average forward speed is 30 mph but may vary from nearly stationary to 70 mph The strongest tornadoes have rotating winds of more than 250 mph Tornadoes can accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land Waterspouts are similar to tornadoes and form over warm water.",1.0791362524032593],["These storms produced strong winds (tornadoes and water spouts in western Oregon on Friday) and heavy amounts of precipitation to the above mentioned areas.",1.0777156352996826],["A tornado formed over water.",1.0752906799316406],["Tornadoes form as winds change direction during a storm.",1.072627305984497],["Excessively strong storms in the form of spiraling winds, called tornadoes, have sometimes occurred in the Chicago area.",1.0567176342010498],["Excessively strong storms in the form of spiralling winds, called tornadoes, have sometimes occurred in the area.",1.0567176342010498],["(ROCK) SALT FACT OR FICTION FEMA employees who are on stand-by to respond to a disaster are known as Disaster Assistance Employees -
