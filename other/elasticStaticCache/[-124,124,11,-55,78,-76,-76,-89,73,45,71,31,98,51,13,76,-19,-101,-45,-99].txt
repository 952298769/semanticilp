revolution and assumed that: Humans became better able to control nature Increased productivity created more free time Greater time available for cultural innovations, that is to create civilization (writing, art, wheel, monumental architecture, etc.) Domestication Early assumptions not supported by current data, but clearly food production did have critical effect on the course of human history Domestication=production of new species of plant and animals that owe their existence to human intervention Active interference in the life cycles of plants and animals by humans such that subsequent generations are of greater utility for and in more intimate contact with humans For species, domestication demands increased dependence on humans Domesticate defined as new species, having undergone some morphological change from wild species, but domestication as process more complicated than this Domestication as Process Domestication was not an event or invention, but the end point of a gradual process Foraging and unintentional influence on diversity, frequency, and distribution of wild plants and animals Plant/animal management (Intentional influence): cultivation, domestication, intensified food production Foraging and Unintentional Consequences Process began as byproduct of exploitation Selective harvesting of species whose range of genetic variation includes individuals of great value to humans (selects for certain individuals and skews genetics) Or, transplanting selected individuals into habitat not conducive to natural reproduction Also, altering habitat to promote certain plants or certain traits of plants Cultivation deliberate care afforded the propagation of a species (Ford 1985) Weeding, pruning, watering, protecting from predators A step further with deliberate transplanting Next step: sowing Cultivation helped to concentrate harvest and provide a more reliable seasonal supplement, but not a high-yield, storable resource Plant Domestication Final stage: intentional selection for useful traits leads to plant species dependent on humans for survival and reproduction Higher-yield, storable Early Centers in the Old World: Near-Middle East: wheat and barley Far East: rice and millet Evidence of Early Plant Domestication Wild cereal \ngrasses, such as wheat, barley, and corn, have fragile (brittle) stems (rachis) Under natural conditions, grasses have brittle rachis and seeds fall off easily and are widely scattered for effective reproduction Domesticated grasses have a tough rachis and seeds stay on, facilitating harvesting It also increases the dependency of the plant on human intervention to reproduce Origins of Agriculture: Near East The Fertile Crescent Arc of territory from the Jordan Valley and eastern Mediterranean to lower Mesopotamia (Tigris and Euphrates Rivers) Agriculture began as by-product of exploiting wild grasses in late Pleistocene Cradle of Civilization : 6,000 years ago the first state-level civilization, Sumer, evolved after 4,000 year process of plant domestication Natufian Hunters-Gatherers From 13,000-10,000 BP, hunters-gatherers known as Natufian culture collected wild wheat and barley for food Mobile settlement, using wild plant resources seasonally (not focused on any resource though) Shift from simple to complex foraging Limiting Properties of Wild Wheat and Barley Brittle rachis portion to which kernel was attached became brittle when ripe for seed dispersal, so had to be there at precise moment Thick husks difficult to remove edible kernel (required roasting or soaking, then winnowing) Only two-row kernels, not a lot of food potential per plant Dispersed occurrence scattered distribution of wild plants limited yield Intensification Despite shortcomings, wild plants formed a significant and important resource Populations sought the densest stands of wheat and barley and came up with innovations to improve returns Sickles and containers for harvesting, storage facilities, grinding basins, plant roasting pits Wild wheat (left) from Mureybat, Syria compared to domesticated variety from Greece some 2-3,000 years later Childe s Oasis Theory As Pleistocene glaciers melted, world s climate became hotter and drier In desert areas, the few well watered areas became oases People, animals, and plants became more densely concentrated near oases
