Waited for 20 years to publish-contacted by Alfred Wallace in 1858, who had independently come to the same conclusions Basis of theory limited food and space variety within a species (variations are inherited and passed on) success of some individuals due to individual variation, some are more successful than others at leaving offspring Darwinian \"fitness\" or success is limited to production of offspring Inheritance of successful traits successful organisms have inherited traits that help them survive traits carried by individuals that produce no offspring will die out natural selection environment determines which individuals are most successful and will reproduce Artificial selection goes on all the time Nature selects for or against traits Populations change with time Changes in population are shaped by natural selection over time a population changes to the point that it is a different species Definitions Population=individuals of the same species in a defined area Species=actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations (production of viable offspring) Evolution=genetic changes with time Populations evolve, individuals do not Individual's genetic composition is set at conception Genes, located on chromosomes code for various traits Genes exist in two or more forms called alleles Genotype=genetic makeup Phenotype=physical appearance Variability (or genetic diversity) is critical Problems with lack of variabiliy (disease can wipe out populations without enough variable resistance) Variability can be effected by factors that produce new alleles mutations-occur randomly-some good-most bad-may be selected for or against resuffling of existing alleles recombination offspring differ from parents through random recombination of alleles random combinations may make individuals more or less fit (or have no effect) increases variability genetic drift separation of populations smaller group=less \nvariability interbreeding causes more homogeneous populations e.g. reproductive isolation of european royal families resulted in expression of hemophilia migration introduction of new individuals into populations exit of existing members of population the impact varies depending on the size of the population selection pressures anything that systematically alters the genotypes of a population in natural selection, nature does the selecting in artificial selection humans do the selection selection is based on phenotypic characteristics examples peppered moth cows grazing in pasture Evidence for Evolution Evidence from Fossil Record shows what extinct life forms looked like gaps occur in fossil record newer layers of rock (and fossils) are deposited on older layers show that different organisms lived at different times organisms from the past are different than those today fossils found close to each other are similar (those distant from each other are more different) sometimes intermediate forms are found generally, older rocks have more simple fossils than more recent Evidence from Comparative Anatomy natural selection can only use existing structures and gradually modify them homologous structures-related structures in related organisms e.g. forelimbs of mammals same bones exist but forms change man to bat to whale vestigal organs-basic organs with no apparent use in the current form, but string resemblance to ancestral forms humans retain vertebrae that wiggle tails whales retain hipbones Evidence from Embryology embryos of many organisms are very similar human embryos pass through stage with gill slits and tails Evidence from Biochemistry All living organisms use DNA and the same amino acids Patterns of Evolution Gradual change populations change slowly over many years, gradually producing new species Divergent evolution single populations split and differences gradually accumulate Adaptive radiation simultaneous divergent evolution Convergent evolution dissimilar or distantly related organisms begin to look alike (whales and porpoises look like fish) Rates of Evolution Phyletic gradualism divided populations change at about the same gradual rate Punctuated equilibrium gradual changes should result in lots of intermediate forms intermediates can be hard to find Gould and Eldredge proposed mechanism by which little change over long period of time large changes occur in short period of time (accounting for scarcity of intermediate forms)",1.0055787563323975],["18 It is now necessary to look at the historical evidence to see whether the particular
