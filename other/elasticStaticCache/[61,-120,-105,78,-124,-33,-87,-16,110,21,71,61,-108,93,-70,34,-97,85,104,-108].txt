Content: Waves, wind, water, and ice shape and reshape the earth's land surface BENCHMARKS As a basis for understanding this concept, students know: 5.1 some changes in the earth are due to slow processes, such as erosion, and some changes are due to rapid processes, such as landslides, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes 5.2 natural processes, including freezing/thawing and growth of roots, cause rocks to break down into smaller pieces 5.3 moving water erodes land forms, reshaping the land by taking away from some places and depositing it as pebbles, sand, silt, and mud in other places
