telolecithal : yolk concentrated in one part of the egg - the area with less yolk and prominent haploid nucleus as the animal pole and the area with more yolk as the vegetal pole At fertilization, enzymes in the acrosome of the sperm help to penetrate the egg requires that the sperm break through the plasma and vitelline membrane surrounding the egg to prevent more than one sperm from penetrating the egg ( polyspermy ), the egg undergoes a cortical reaction to bring the sperm head into the interior of the egg and change the vitelline envelope to form the fertilization membrane Just after fertilization the zygote (fertilized egg) undergoes cleavage (mitotic cell divisions) and becomes subdivided into smaller cells - the gross arrangement of cells differs greatly among vertebrates, depending on the amount of yolk in the egg: Holoblastic cleavage occurs when the cleavage furrows pass through the entire egg cleavage can either be equal, where the resulting cells contain the same amount of yolk, or unequal, in which some cells contain more yolk than others: - equal cleavage occurs in microlecithal eggs - unequal cleavage occurs in mesolecithal eggs cleavage results in the formation of a ball of cells ( blastomeres ) surrounding an internal cavity ( blastocoel ) Meroblastic cleavage occurs more in macrolecithal eggs cleavage takes place only in a disk at the animal pole the cleavage furrows do not extend into the yolk results in the formation of the blastodisk that lies on the top of the yolk Gastrulation is characterized by cell movement and

around the developing embryo these membranes are called the amnion, chorion and allantois reptile, bird and mammal embryos form these membranes during embryogenesis these animals are collectively known as amniotes anatomical characteristics allowing division of the amniotes (especially important for paleontology) anatomical structures of the skull allow us to identify three early offshoots from the first amniotic animals anapsids skull has only a depression for the eye socket synapsids skull has a single depression in addition to the eye socket posterior to eye diapsids two additional cavities in the skull posterior and dorsally to eye socket reptiles are represented by two of these divisions - the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta)
