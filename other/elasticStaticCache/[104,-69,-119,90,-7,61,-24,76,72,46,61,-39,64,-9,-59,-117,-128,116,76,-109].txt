[7] For example, in the picture on the bottom of the page, a 100mL graduated cylinder was used to measure the liquid. The cylinder contains 60mL liquid volume. The main reason as to why the reading of the volume is done via meniscus is due to the nature of the liquid in a closed surrounded space. By nature, liquid in the cylinder would be attracted to the wall around it through molecular forces. This forces the liquid surface to develop either a convex or concave shape, depending on the type of the liquid in the cylinder. Reading the liquid at the bottom part of a concave or the top part of the convex liquid is equivalent to reading the liquid at its meniscus . [8] From the picture, the level of the liquid will be read at the bottom of the meniscus , which is the concave. The most accurate of the reading that could be done here is reduced down to 1 mL due to the given means of measurement on the cylinder. From this, the derived error would be one tenth of the least figure. For instance, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 36.5 mL. The error, give or take 0.1 mL, must be included too. Therefore, the more precise value equates to 36.5",0.8933137655258179],["A small graduated cylinder or beaker.<br>graduated cylinder<br>A measuring cylinder, a volumetric flask, a pipette, a burette.
