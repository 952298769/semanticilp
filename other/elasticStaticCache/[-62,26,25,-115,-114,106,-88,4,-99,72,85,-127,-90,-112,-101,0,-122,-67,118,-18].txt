of the roof the forest birds made their Nest A soft cottage with a gentle touch Painted in fairy tales The windows adorned in white lace curtains With squares of glass to let in the sun To warm the air inside the dainty house A flower box filled with the pretties of spring Beneath the window slightly raised so the Breeze can bring their beauty in Tall oak trees and their lofty branches Formed an umbrella over the cottage below In autumn months the playful squirrels Gather acorns for the winter to come Dropping acorns to the cottage roof Scampering down the nearest tree to retrieve The ones they lost on the ground below The modest furnishing of a simple life Provide the comforts of a home The forest green from its rebirth in spring Wild flowers displaying their riches for all to see Spring's aroma fills the air with smells of fresh new living things that came to life in spring The flowers growing around the cottage displayed Their beauty in a joyful way A kettle hangs in the fire place on a hook embedded In stone A fireplace with sand stone in brown And red and a hearth of granite stone A path well worn by years of travel winding Over a brook and under the trees beginning where The forest does and ending at the cottage door A happy home in its niche under the trees Colors so happy they dance in a breeze And the brook laughs all the way to the sea The wooden bucket many years old on the ground Outside the door filled with the spring fresh water Each morning day for anyone needing to quench Their thirst Inside the cottage preparing her meal As she watches the spring time grow She talks to the birds with her quiet voice Adding the rich tones of her own to spring's mellow symphony The trees and the flowers know her too As she calls each by name Urging them to grow in beauty Coaxing them with her voice Her slender body hides only the years That developed her kindly smile Her dark brown hair with strands of grey Add to the maturity of her years The wrinkles that mark her lovely face Deepened by her many tears Emphasize the deep beauty of her eyes The vastness of infinity in the beauty Deepened by her many tears Emphasize the deep beauty of her eyes The vastness of infinity in the beauty Deep inside with her lived her favorite friend to Spend the time A cat, who too has seen his years His long grey hair and busy tail hide battle scars From fighting his peers Mellowed by age he's Made the cottage his home And through the Years his agile body has never lost its tone Any visitors stopping to rest are always Welcome here her meal made of the best The forest gives is shared with any who Stay Her lovely voice and gentle words Leave you inebriated with love she's not the First to use the cottage made hundreds of years ago A quaint happy home
