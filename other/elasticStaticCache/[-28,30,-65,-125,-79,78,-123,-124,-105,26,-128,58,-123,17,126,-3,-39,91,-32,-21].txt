Try to observe your turtle daily. Regularly look at its shell and skin for any abnormalities, cuts and lumps. Watch it when it eats, when it is in the water and as it walks around. You will begin to know your turtle and its normal behavior so when it does get sick, youll be able to notice the change in behavior and activity. Weigh the turtle, and do it often enough so you can tell if it begins to lose weight. Occasionally look at the turtles feces. Is it well formed and is the food being digested? Turtles dont get a fever, or start to moan or make faces. The first signs of illness are usually a change in eating pattern or activity levels. If the turtle has a respiratory infection, it may start to gasp or breathe with its mouth open. It may blow bubbles from its nose or it may have diarrhea. If it has worms, it will begin to lose weight or you might see white worms in the feces. None of these symptoms are very noticeable unless you are observant and make it a habit to check on the health of your turtle.",1.8173836469650269],["How Turtles Breathe",1.7528513669967651],["A Maldives Hawksbill Turtle Breathing",1.7528513669967651],["Leatherback Turtles Breathe in for Buoyancy",1.7528513669967651],["Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts",1.7528513669967651],["Stage 3: Turtle Breathing",1.7528513669967651],["The shell helps the turtle breathe.",1.7528513669967651],["A Maldives Hawksbill Turtle Breathing",1.7528513669967651],["How Turtles Breathe",1.7528513669967651],["Stage 3: Turtle Breathing",1.7528513669967651],["Leatherback Turtles Breathe in for Buoyancy",1.7528513669967651],["Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts",1.7528513669967651],["Turtles breathe air;",1.7528513669967651],["Tube worms breathe water but eat no organic foodstuffs in all the decades of their fast-growing, if sedentary, adult lives.",1.7260146141052246],["Tube worms breathe water but eat no organic foodstuffs in all the decades of their fast-growing, if sedentary, adult lives.",1.7260146141052246],["The worm-like creatures burrowed beneath the biomat, eating its decaying underside and breathing the oxygen produced by the algae.",1.7260146141052246],["Worms need moist bedding to breathe through their &quot;skin&quot; and they also eat the cellulose fiber.",1.7260146141052246],["Learn and teach how plants grow, how worms breathe, what beetles eat.",1.7260146141052246],["How Do Worms Breathe?",1.6919288635253906],["This allows the worm to breathe in oxygen.",1.6919288635253906],["How Do Worms Breathe?",1.6919288635253906],["While the presence of worms – and the breathing caused by such a presence – can be knocked out with a trip to the vet and a de-worming treatment, rapid breathing caused by excessive air intake will be neutralized by the pup learning how to eat at a proper pace.",1.6887221336364746],["Eating and breathing.",1.6857140064239502],["Examples of a whale&#146;s behavior include swimming, diving, breathing, and eating.",1.640926718711853],["(For example, all eat, sleep, need air to breathe) 3.",1.640926718711853],["examples include: a particular eating event, a particular breathing event, etc.",1.640926718711853],["Example: Have something to eat or do deep breathing exercises.",1.640926718711853]]
