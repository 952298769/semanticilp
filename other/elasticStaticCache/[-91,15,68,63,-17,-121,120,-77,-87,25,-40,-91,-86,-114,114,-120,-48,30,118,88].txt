Inherited traits can be a physical trait or a behavior. Examples of physical inherited traits include hair, eye and skin color, facial features, height, dimples, length of toes and muscle structures. Examples of behavioral traits include a terrier's instinct to chase small animals or a cat puffing out its hair in response to a threat. Although inherited traits are often associated with things we can see, these traits also play an important role in how the body develops and functions. For example, inherited traits can increase risks for heart disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma and diabetes.",1.4595216512680054],["Most cat owners like to provide their cats the opportunity to chase a toy or other artificial prey.",1.3177040815353394],["Give the cat chase toys.",1.1603903770446777],["Give the cat chase toys.",1.1603903770446777]]
