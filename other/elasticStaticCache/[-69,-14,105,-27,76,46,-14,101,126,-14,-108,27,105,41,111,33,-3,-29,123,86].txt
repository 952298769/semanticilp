generally quite different VERTISOLS Predominated by swelling clays Swell when wet and shrink when dry, forming large cracks Surface soil washes into cracks, &quot;inverting&quot; profile Found in Texas and large areas or third world No basements ALFISOLS Possess argillic horizon with &gt;35% base saturation Natric horizon if &gt;15% Na saturation Light colored, low OM, crusting (ochric)

MOLLISOLS Possess mollic epipedon Dark, thick, &gt;0.6% OC, &gt;50% base saturation Usually high OM in corn belt Soft and crumbly when dry Often have argillic B horizons Probably the most widespread soils in the world Form under grass or forest (wet spots) Good dirt, maybe the best for crop production Easy to work, high native fertility, good water holding capacity ULTISOLS Like alfisols, but &lt;35% BS in argillic horizon Common across SE US Not particularly fertile, and often acidic Productive if managed intensively, and weather cooperates OXISOLS Most highly weathered soils Subsurface oxic horizon, high in clay-sized particles of Al and Fe hydrous oxides Most weatherable primary mineral material leached away Very old and infertile (high nutrient fixation capacities) Most nutrients contained in vegetation overlying soil Found generally in humid tropics HISTOSOLS Soils with &gt; 12% OC (organic soils) Formed in very wet environments (bogs) Plant material decomposes rapidly upon drainage Very productive, but difficult to manage Groupings of soils in the field Associations-More than one soil occurring in a given area Complexes-Tightly intertwined associations, too intricate to map at normal scale Catenas or Toposequences-Sequences of soils occurring with changes in drainage or landscape position Many soils are related and tend to occur together Miamian-Celina-Crosby-Kokomo catena Morley-Glynwood-Blount-Pewamo catena Soil drainage classes Refer to the extent of seasonal wetness, not rate of water movement Position of water table Well-drained soils have deep water tables Somewhat poorly drained soils have fluctuating tables - mottles Poorly drained soils have shallow water tables for long periods Usually require tile drainage SOIL TEXTURE AND STRUCTURE Soil TEXTURE refers to the size distribution of soil particles Gives the soil a characteristic &quot;feel&quot; Texture influences Soil water relations - drainage, percolation, water holding Soil consistency and plasticity Soil density Response of soil to manipulation Ability to support desirable uses Sand-sized particles (0.05-2 mm) Generally composed of primary minerals Almost no surface reactivity Not sticky Often coated with clay or OM Pack loosely, leaving large pores Conducts water and air easily Holds little water against gravity Silt-sized particles (0.002-0.05 mm) Essentially small sand particles Often clay or OM coated Little surface activity Some stickiness, but generally feels floury Pack more tightly Slower water movement and more retention Responsible for formation of dense crusts on some soils Clay-sized particles (&lt;0.002 mm) Invisible to naked eye Very large surface to volume ratio (10-1000 m 2 per g) Often platelike with layers Strong reactive properties Water and ion adsorption Shrink-swell tendencies Sticky when wet Usually secondary minerals Pack very tightly Very slow water movement Good water retention but poor availability Help to give soil structure OM binding and cation bridging (flocculation) TEXTURAL CLASSES Groupings of soils according to relative percentages of sand silt and clay Extremely useful piece of basic soils information Often used as phase descriptor Loams - soils exhibiting approximately equal characteristics of three fractions Good water movement, retention, and availability Reasonably good aggregation Textural triangle Note predominance of textural classes named &quot;clay&quot; Most Ohio soils in the silt loam and silty clay loam categories Changing textural class is extremely difficult due to amount of material involved SOIL STRUCTURE Grouping or arrangement of individual particles Individual structural units are called &quot;aggregates&quot; or &quot;peds&quot; Hold together but separate from one another along planes of weakness Structure provides much of the soil's porosity (micro and macro) Allows soil to transmit water and air rapidly Allows for better root development Nutrients and MOs often concentrated along structural boundaries Granular or Crumb structure (Spheroidal) Soil exists in small rounded aggregates Characteristic of surface soils Favored by high OM and mechanical action Good for root development Plate-like structure Soil aggregates into thin horizontal plates Often seen in forest soils Can slow water and air movement Block-like structure Soil aggregates into 6-sided blocks of some size Common in subsurface horizons &quot;Blocky&quot; - rectangular faces &quot;Subangular blocky&quot; - irregular faces Prism-like structure Soil aggregates into columns taller than wide Often seen in subsurface horizons &quot;Prismatic&quot; - level tops &quot;Columnar&quot; - rounded tops More than one type of \naggregation usually exists in a given profile Structure can be temporarily altered, or destroyed by mechanical interference Cause of natural structure not well understood Takes time, OM and/or cations, and external forces Aggregate formation and stabilization Formation Mechanical action (freezing and thawing) bring particles together and orient them for maximum interaction Flocculation by multivalent cations Binding by fungal mycelia during initial OM decomposition Binding by sticky organic exudates None of this provides permanent stability Stabilization Orientation of clay particles in OM Decomposition of OM into more permanent binding compounds Binding by Al and Fe oxides Formation of clay, oxide and humic skins around existing aggregates Farmers often promote structural desirability by fall tillage on &quot;heavier&quot; soils in Western Ohio Freezing and thawing of loosened soil promotes formation of easily worked and desirable crumb structure SOIL DENSITY AND PORESPACE Particle density = (mass of solids)/(volume of solids) Determined only by mass of solid fraction Mineral material density - 2.60-2.75 g/cc Organic matter density - 1.1-1.4 g/cc General average particle density for mineral soils - 2.65 g/cc Bulk density = (mass of soil)/(volume of soil) Porespace included in volume BD &lt; PD because air and water have lower density than soil solids Amount of porespace is major determinant of bulk density More porespace produces lower density BD generally lower in finer than coarser textured soils Better structure in former produce more PS More but smaller pores Finer-textured soils, however, can often be compacted more severely than coarser-textured ones Smaller particles can be packed more closely BD generally varies - 1.0-1.5 g/cc in most soils BD can be increased abnormally by trafficking Squeezes out porespace BD can be increased by land clearing or tillage Removes OM, physically or by oxidation Destroys aggregation BD generally increases with depth Less OM deeper in profile Less mechanical

areas near buildings or sidewalks Apply water sparingly to heavy soils, low lying areas and shaded areas For strong grass and deep rooting, make sure your lawn gets one inch of water per week during the growing season To gauge the amount of water you are using on your yard, place a pie pan or small can in your lawn to collect and measure water Mowing Make sure your lawn mower blade is sharp for an even cut Mow every five days under normal conditions Mow only when grass is dry, wet grass causes clumping Cut no more than one-third of your grass height Fertilizing Know your fertilizer types: Granular Fertilizers -- best for a year-round, systematic lawn treatment Water Soluble Fertilizers -- best for spot treatments on smaller areas To apply granular fertilizer evenly, choose either a rotary-type spreader or drop-type spreader Use a rotary spreader for large areas that need wide disbursement of fertilizer Use a drop spreader in areas that require controlled placement of fertilizer (i.e. around flowerbeds) Be sure to sweep fertilizer off sidewalks and driveways to avoid staining Try to maintain a soil pH level of about 6.5 To measure pH, you can purchase a pH testing kit at your local lawn and garden center or contact your County Extension agent Use a lime product on your lawn to raise soil pH Use a gypsum or sulfur product on your lawn to lower soil pH Insect Protection To
