[["or egg to larva to pupa to butterfly) Energy: (CS 5) Light Students will be able to: Explore the relationships between shadow size and shape, and the position of a light source Investigate light as it comes from a source, travels through air, and bounces off objects Create and describe the spectrum produced by light passing through a prism Sound Students will be able to: Investigate sound as it comes from a source, travels through air, and bounces off objects Observe that sound is created in musical instruments by parts that vibrate (e.g. see and feel the vibrating strings, drums, cymbals, loudspeakers) Heat Students will be able to: Observe how the sun warms the land, air, water, and other objects Observe how their body feels warmer as they increase their level of activity Identify natural and manufactured objects that produce heat Explore how rubbing various things together will produce different amounts of heat Energy Students will be able to: Explore (by touch) how the outside temperatures of containers made of various materials (e.g. aluminum can, paper cup, Styrofoam, glass, thermos) change when filled with hot water Observe that most things that produce light also produce heat Science as Inquiry (CS 1) Students will be able to: Observe and describe objects in their environment in order to organize information and make comparisons (e.g. cats have fur, fish live in water, rocks are hard) Manipulate an object to discover characteristics not apparent by observation alone Science, Technology, and Society (CS 2) Students will be able to: Invent their own unit of measurement (e.g. the room is nine \"Nancy's\" wide) Use rulers, thermometers, and balances to observe and measure objects Use simple tools in a safe and responsible manner Share data Use age appropriate instructional software Unifying Themes and Concepts (CS 6) Students will be able to: Predict the effect of removing or exchanging parts of an object (e.g. a mechanical toy, a jigsaw puzzle) Discuss how parts when put together can do things that they could not do by themselves Assemble a commercial product using manufacturer's instructions (e.g. Legos, plastic models) Describe or demonstrate how something may not work well if a part is missing, broken, worn out, mismatched, or misconnected Suggest several possible uses for a simple object (e.g. a washer on a string, a balance beam) Observe the movement of people or objects (e.g. record traffic patterns of students moving in the school building)",0.9428123235702515],["Illicit from students that air and water will be the
