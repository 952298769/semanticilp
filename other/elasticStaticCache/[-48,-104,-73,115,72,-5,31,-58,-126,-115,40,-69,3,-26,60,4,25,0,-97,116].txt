to become Moon, separating ever more from Earth because of tidal forces Major objection is that primitive Earth could not have spun rapidly enough to promote fission through rotational instability Second objection is that, compared with Earth rocks, lunar rocks have slightly greater proportions of those elements that are difficult to vaporize and slightly less of the easily-vaporized elements which suggests that Moon formed from material somewhat hotter than that from which Earth formed Second concept is condensation or co-accretion theory Essence of this idea is Earth and Moon are actually a double planet system with colliding debris trapped in orbit around growing Earth accreting to form Moon Supports comes from fact that the two bodies are of comparable ages (4.6 billion years) Since chemical analysis of lunar rock samples shows some chemical disparities between Earth and Moon, they may or may not have evolved from same parent material If it was the same parent material for both bodies, then some aspect of formation process permitted chemical disparities to arise Third concept is capture theory Postulates that proto-Moon originally was moving in a highly eccentric orbit around Sun Approaches Earth on an almost collision course Moon is disrupted by strong tidal forces, and most or some portion of fragmented body became Earth's satellite Problem with this idea is that capture is not easy to accomplish, since some physical mechanism must occur to remove some kinetic energy of captured body so that it moves from solar to Earth orbit Just passing by a more massive body does not automatically lead to capture In post-Apollo era, lunar samples impose strict restrictions on three classical origin theories such that all three are deficient Unfortunately Apollo samples in themselves do not provide answer, they provide boundaries within which any serious theory is constrained to lie Post-Apollo theory called collisional-ejection theory

millions of years and forms Moon Chief advantages is its ability to account for the near similarities, but distinct differences, in the chemical composition of Earth and Moon Jovian Planets' Formation Within outer cooler regions of solar nebula, icy planetesimals collided, building larger bodies of icy and rocky materials As these bodies grew to a mass a few times that of Earth, they attracted gravitationally hydrogen and helium from surrounding gas Capture and retention of gaseous materials was easier far from Sun, where temperatures were lower Because of their great masses, Jupiter and to
