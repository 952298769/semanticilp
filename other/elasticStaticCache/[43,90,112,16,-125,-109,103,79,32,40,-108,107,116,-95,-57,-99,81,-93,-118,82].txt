number of steps collaborate with others in scientific investigations suggest possible interpretations for a set of observations describe the similarities and differences between simple objects suggest questions for investigations identify international hazard symbols on common household products handle equipment and materials safely Grades 2 to 3 conduct simple tests and describe observations use simple magnifiers or microscopes to observe things suggest possible improvements to investigations formulate questions to guide observation and investigations use a variety of measuring instruments to gather accurate information identify patterns and groupings to draw conclusions from information communicate scientific observations to peers, teachers, and family construct models to represent ideas or concepts describe the ways people in the community use science use a variety of science equipment safely conserve resources in the school Grade 4 predict the results of an experiment perform an experiment by following a procedure use appropriate tools to assist in observation construct simple definitions based on their experiment demonstrate an ability to recognize a valid interpretation of their results present their interpretation of the results from an experiment use a variety of media to present information demonstrate responsible action \nwhen using the scientific information and skills they have developed Grade 5 design a scientific experiment identify relevant variables in an experiment identify and test a prediction classify and order based on a set of keys and criteria correctly state a hypothesis differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information use appropriate technologies to record, measure, save, and retrieve data describe technologies that allow humans to extend their natural abilities describe how technology has affected human health identify ways science is used responsibly in their communities Grade 6 design a scientific test and evaluate its fairness demonstrate the appropriate use of microscopes use instruments to make a variety of direct measurements draw reasonable conclusions from experiments organize and interpret information in simple tables and graphs write clear, step-by-step instructions for conducting investigations, operating something, or following a procedure compare ways of solving problems and finding explanations explain how hypotheses can be valuable, even if they turn out to be not true demonstrate an appreciation of the importance of keeping honest and unbiased scientific records discuss the contributions

useful quantitative and qualitative information investigate how models may be used to think about processes that cannot be observed directly evaluate conclusions in relation to other evidence and sources use graphs to summarize experimental data identify factors that have made possible or limited the work of particular scientists describe how technology and science are related propose and
