gravity is towards moon and decreases with distance away from moon On the moon-side of Earth net force is towards moon, gravity&gt;inertia On far side of Earth net force is away from moon, inertia&gt;gravity Net forces raise ocean water into a high tide, one each on the near and far side of the Earth Water drawn for bulge of high tide causes troughs (low tide) in other regions Heights of tide (bulge) small ~ 2 metres (6 ft) Wavelength ~12,000 miles, tries to travel at ~ 1,000 mph to keep up with the moon, usually fails Solar day is 24 hrs, lunar day is 24h 51 minutes so high tides are 51 minutes later each day Moon's monthly cycle from 28 N to 28 S of the equator affects height of high and low tides Effect of the Sun: Sun is 27 million times larger than the moon but is also 368 times further away Gravitational pull of the Sun raises tides, is ~ 46% strength of that of the moon Sun has an annual cycle from 23 N to 23 S Sun and Moon together: Sun and moon on the same side or opposite side of the Earth, forces add up get high, high tides, and low, low tides get Spring Tides When Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other forces cancel get low high tides etc. get Neap Tides Complete cycle takes 28 days (lunar month) Are other factors affecting tidal height such as Earth- Sun distance Altogether 150 factors affect tides, 7 have most effect Amplitude (height) of tide corresponds closely to Moon phases Real tidal patterns Expect two high and two low tides per lunar day (Semidiurnal tide) Tide is a very large wave, its progression is affected by shapes of ocean basins and presence of continents Get constructive and destructive interference of tidal waves Local tides affected by these factors Tide types Semidiurnal: 2 high and 2 low tides per day Diurnal: 1 high and 1 low tide per day Mixed tide: 2 \nhigh and 2 low tides per day but of unequal height Tidal heights are zero at Amphidronic points (points of destructive interference) Bay of Fundy (Canada) tides are up to 50 ft Honolulu has a mixed tide which is ~ 6 ft or less Effect of tides on day length Gravitational energy causing tides is dissipated as friction this is slowing the rotation of the Earth Day length is increasing, but number of days per year is decreasing 350 million years ago 22 hrs/day ~405 days per year 350 million years from now ~ 26 hrs/day ~ 320 days per year With fewer
