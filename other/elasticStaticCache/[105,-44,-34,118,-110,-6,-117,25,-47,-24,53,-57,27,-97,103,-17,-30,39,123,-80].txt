grown with that water too) the average precipitation in the US is about 30 inches but it varies from essentially nothing in the southwest to 200 inches or more in the east and northwest Runoff Effects of soil soil characteristics greatly affect the degree of runoff versus infiltration clay content reduces infiltration, especially after the ground is saturated with water (which swells the clay) sandy soil or friable loams, both of which have low clay content, have higher rates of infiltration more densely compacted soils have lower rates of infiltration note: rainfall can actually compact soil rainfalling directly on soil also tends to plug the opening in the ground with fines from near the surface (like espresso grind coffee in a melitta filter) waterlogged soil has a lower rate of infiltration than dry soil frozen soil has almost no infiltration (it may actually be coated with ice thus the timing and dynamics of a storm event can have a great influence on the proportion of runoff generally speaking, longer or repeated rains result in more runoff human development of an area usually has a dramatic effect on increasing runoff paving and roofs have essentially no infiltration one of the engineering calculations that must be done when planning a development is the excess flood flow--this must be taken into account diverted stormwater may have substantially poorer quality than native runoff (metals and oils etc from the streets and yards) commercial and industrial establishments that discharge stormwater at a point are now subject to the restrictions of categorical wastewater discharge permit Effects of vegetation vegetation can greatly increase the rate of infiltration hold water in place, buffer the release of water to the groundsurface shield the soil surface from some of the effects of compaction by rainfall clear cutting a forest can increase runoff and erosion disastrously, as can overgrazing and improper cropping proper management reduces the effects in fact, well conducted forestry (including some clear cutting) can increase the amount of snowmelt which is available for human use without dangerously increasing erosion plowing along hillside contours (conservation tillage) tends to slowdown runoff and thus decrease erosion and increase infiltration bare soil is bad Erosion and rivers water flow in streams is often turbulent (ie, not laminar or in smooth lines parallel to the stream bed) different flow velocities will lift particles of different sizes generally, smaller particles will be lifted by lower velocities but, clay and silt (&lt;0.06 mm) can be harder to erode can be tightly packed (consolidated) may not stick up into the flow enough suspended matter abrades rocks etc as the river cuts a \nstream channel, the some material is dissolved by surface water passing over it the process of erosion gives rise to stream beds a drainage pattern develops like the veins on a leaf (assuming the surface is uniformly erodable-irregularities change the pattern (trellis or rectangular) the entire area from which a river and its tributaries draw runoff is called a drainage basin or watershed the divisions between drainage basins are ridges called topographic divides these can be drawn on topo maps by always drawing at right angles to the contours a fast young stream cuts rapidly and sharply into the rock (V-shaped cross section) these narrow valleyed rivers have waterfalls and rapids caused by sudden drops in elevation along the stream bed may be caused by erosion (Niagara) or glaciation (Yosemite) slope wash and mass movement (collapse) of the valley walls tend to flatten the walls of the valley a more mature river cuts more laterally, increasing the number and size of side canyons deposits some eroded material in the base of the valley alternatively, the valley itself can be broadly eroded to form a plain an old river has a broad floodplain at the base of the valley, the channel of the river can meander across it the periodic flooding of the river enriches the floodplain with nutrients carried by the swollen river the bed of the river can actually sit above the surrounding floodplain, with the stream channel separated by natural levees the low-lying flood plains are also popular for housing, which can be a problem in the rainy season building dikes can make the problem worse downstream the base flow of a river is fed by springs in a rain storm flow increases, the more widespread a storm is (over the drainage basin) the more flow increases the plot of flow of a river is called the hydrograph Flood protection planning based on the 100 year (or other) flood flood control or management measures: reducing peak flows dams land use controls early warning systems insurance (often from Uncle Sam) Lakes Stratification the slow moving water of lakes is not necessarily mixed by turbulence, thus there is an opportunity for layers to form cool water sinks, warm rises in summer (if the lake is deep enough), the lake separates into the warm epilimnion and the cool hypolimnion the two layers are separated by a thermocline you have felt this with your toes when swimming sometimes you can pick it up with a fishfinder the hypolimnion is isolated from the surface, ie oxygen thus the bottom of the lake can become anoxic due to aerobic decomposition this condition is deadly to fish the anaerobic environment favors reduction reactions sulfide can form solubility of metals and nutrients is affected in winter, the stratification is slightly different with ice and cold water on top and water at 4 C on the bottom if photosynthesis stops due to snow and ice cover, there can be anoxia under the ice in spring and fall, lakes turnover important in the seasonal changes in the lake ecosystem have affects on the distribution and movement of nutrients and metals Groundwater infiltrating water sinks through the permeable substrate until it reaches impermeable material (bedrock or clay) underground, essentially everywhere, there is a layer of permeable soil or rock saturated with water this groundwater is more than 98% of the freshwater on earth such a layer is called an aquifer water table or unconfined artesian or confined flow of water in an aquifer is determined by the permeability (ft/day) and porosity (percent) of the substrate material and the hydraulic head or gradient that the water is under water is drawn for human use from aquifers by wells if water is drawn faster than it can be replenished the aquifer can be depleted (so-called mining of water) subsidence saltwater intrusion (can be counteracted with wastewater injection) groundwater not withdrawn by humans eventually emerges at springs (or underwater discharge zones in streams) where it rejoins runoff to the oceans Limestone &amp; Sinkholes groundwater can \"erode\" soluble rocks like limestone (calcium carbonate) an underground chamber so eroded is called a cavern the ground above such erosion can collapse and form a sinkhole the underground channels in a limestone area can contribute to rapid underground spread of pollutants groundwater movement is difficult to model in Karst areas (as it is in ordinary fractured rock) Glaciers when more snow falls in the winter than melts in the summer, the level of snow rises when the wet of snow and ice gets great enough, they start to flow (very slowly) as a glacier the river of ice has its own erosional characteristics huge boulders and massive quantities of lighter material are carried along when they melt or recede they leave behind fields full of boulders and sandy morraines (like Long Island or Cape Cod) the polar glaciers seem to extend toward the equator in some sort of cycle (peaking at the ice ages) the volume of water frozen in glaciers effects sea level dramatic increase in rate of rise in the last 70 years or so Water Supply the most readily available water is the scarcest (rivers

twigs, etc.) in top layer (= O 1 layer) - dominated by unrecognizable organic matter in next lower layer where some decomposition has occurred (O 2 layer) - sub-surface soil layers (A layers) have

colored, low OM, crusting (ochric) epipedon Thin A horizon Generally an E horizon Develop mainly under forests Predominate in northern and western Ohio Very productive and important agricultural soils OK for other development, also MOLLISOLS Possess mollic epipedon Dark, thick, &gt;0.6% OC, &gt;50% base saturation Usually high OM in corn belt Soft and crumbly when dry Often have argillic B horizons Probably the most widespread soils in the world Form under grass or forest (wet spots) Good dirt, maybe the best for crop production Easy to work, high native fertility, good water holding capacity ULTISOLS Like alfisols, but &lt;35% BS in argillic horizon Common across SE US Not particularly fertile, and often acidic Productive if managed intensively, and weather cooperates OXISOLS Most highly weathered soils Subsurface oxic horizon, high in clay-sized particles of Al and Fe hydrous oxides Most weatherable primary mineral material leached away Very old and infertile (high nutrient fixation capacities) Most nutrients contained in vegetation overlying soil Found generally in humid tropics HISTOSOLS Soils with &gt; 12% OC (organic soils) Formed in very wet environments (bogs) Plant material decomposes rapidly upon drainage Very productive, but difficult to manage Groupings of soils in the field Associations-More than one soil occurring in a given area Complexes-Tightly intertwined associations, too intricate to map at normal scale Catenas or Toposequences-Sequences of soils occurring with changes in drainage or landscape position Many soils are related and tend to occur together Miamian-Celina-Crosby-Kokomo catena Morley-Glynwood-Blount-Pewamo catena Soil drainage classes Refer to the extent of seasonal wetness, not rate of water movement Position of water table Well-drained soils have deep water tables Somewhat poorly drained soils have fluctuating tables - mottles Poorly drained soils have shallow water tables for long periods Usually require tile drainage SOIL TEXTURE AND STRUCTURE Soil TEXTURE refers to the size distribution of soil particles Gives the soil a characteristic &quot;feel&quot; Texture influences Soil water relations - drainage, percolation, water holding Soil consistency and plasticity Soil density Response of soil to manipulation Ability to support desirable uses Sand-sized particles (0.05-2 mm) Generally composed of primary minerals Almost no surface reactivity Not sticky Often coated with clay or OM Pack loosely, leaving large pores Conducts water and air easily Holds little water against gravity Silt-sized particles (0.002-0.05 mm) Essentially small sand particles Often clay or OM coated Little surface activity Some stickiness, but generally feels floury Pack more tightly Slower water movement and more retention Responsible for formation of dense crusts on some soils Clay-sized particles (&lt;0.002 mm) Invisible to naked eye Very large surface to volume ratio (10-1000 m 2 per g) Often platelike with layers Strong reactive properties Water and ion adsorption Shrink-swell tendencies Sticky when wet Usually secondary minerals Pack very tightly Very slow water movement Good water retention but poor availability Help to give soil structure OM binding and cation bridging (flocculation) TEXTURAL CLASSES Groupings of soils according to relative percentages of sand silt and clay Extremely useful piece of basic soils information Often used as phase descriptor Loams - soils exhibiting approximately equal characteristics of three fractions Good water movement, retention, and availability Reasonably good aggregation Textural triangle Note predominance of textural classes named &quot;clay&quot; Most Ohio soils in the silt loam and silty clay loam categories Changing textural class is extremely difficult due to amount of material involved SOIL STRUCTURE Grouping or arrangement of individual particles Individual structural units are called &quot;aggregates&quot; or &quot;peds&quot; Hold together but separate from one another along planes of weakness Structure provides much of the soil's porosity (micro and macro) Allows soil to transmit water and air rapidly Allows for better root development Nutrients and MOs often concentrated along structural boundaries Granular or Crumb structure (Spheroidal) Soil exists in small rounded aggregates Characteristic of surface soils Favored by high OM and mechanical action Good for root development Plate-like structure Soil aggregates into thin horizontal plates Often seen in forest soils Can slow water and air movement Block-like structure Soil aggregates into 6-sided blocks of some size Common in subsurface horizons &quot;Blocky&quot; - rectangular faces &quot;Subangular blocky&quot; - irregular faces Prism-like structure Soil aggregates into columns taller than wide Often seen in subsurface horizons &quot;Prismatic&quot; - level tops &quot;Columnar&quot; - rounded tops More than one type of \naggregation usually exists in a given profile Structure can be temporarily altered, or destroyed by mechanical interference Cause of natural structure not well understood Takes time, OM and/or cations, and external forces Aggregate formation and stabilization Formation Mechanical action (freezing and thawing) bring particles together and orient them for maximum interaction Flocculation by multivalent cations Binding by fungal mycelia during initial OM decomposition Binding by sticky organic exudates None of this provides permanent stability Stabilization Orientation of clay particles in OM Decomposition of OM into more permanent binding compounds Binding by Al and Fe oxides Formation of clay, oxide and humic skins around existing aggregates Farmers often promote structural desirability by fall tillage on &quot;heavier&quot; soils in Western Ohio Freezing and thawing of loosened soil promotes formation of easily worked and desirable crumb structure SOIL DENSITY AND PORESPACE Particle density = (mass of solids)/(volume of solids) Determined only by mass of solid fraction Mineral material density - 2.60-2.75 g/cc Organic matter density - 1.1-1.4 g/cc General average particle density for mineral soils - 2.65 g/cc Bulk density = (mass of soil)/(volume of soil) Porespace included in volume BD &lt; PD because air and water have lower density than soil solids Amount of porespace is major determinant of bulk density More porespace produces lower density BD generally lower in finer than coarser textured soils Better structure in former produce more PS More but smaller pores Finer-textured soils, however, can often be compacted more severely than coarser-textured ones Smaller particles can be packed more closely BD generally varies - 1.0-1.5 g/cc in most soils BD can be increased abnormally by trafficking Squeezes out porespace BD can be increased by land clearing or tillage Removes OM, physically or by oxidation Destroys aggregation BD generally increases with depth

SQUARE FEET CORRECTLY 6 2/3 INCHES DEEP IN OHIO Porespace in soils Created by Incomplete interlocking of soil particles Spaces between structural units and aggregates Root and soil animal channels Micropores - retain water against gravity Macropores - allow water to flow freely Coarse textured soils dominated by macropores Fine textured soils (clays) dominated by micropores Good soils have a balance of both Compaction by excessive loads often results in increase in micropore space and loss of macropore space Larger pores squeezed out Air exchange reduced Water movement slowed considerably More runoff Less infiltration Slower drainage of excess water in soil A mix of pore sizes assures retention of adequate water for plant growth but also allows for drainage of excess A continuous pore

case: Sanmexia dam, Yellow River, China: filled up in 4 years it was rehabilitated, by digging tunnels into the base of the dam and flushing out the \nsediment --- a major expense Soil salinization The recipe for soil salinization is also easy (recall our previous discussion of Irrigation and Salinization in the lecture on Surface Water ) Begin with an arid climate Irrigate crops with water containing dissolved solids (river water or groundwater will do) Allow irrigation water to evaporate... leaving the dissolved solids behind in the soil AND/OR Allow irrigation water to infiltrate without drainage water table rises soil is exposed to groundwater with high dissolved solids Consequences of soil salinization loss of soil fertility in extreme cases, the land loses its ability to produce crops Soil pollution (recall our previous lecture on Water Pollution ) agricultural biocides and fertilizers industrial waste disposal, leaks, and spills Consequences of soil pollution damage to soil ecosystem loss of soil fertility pollution of crops soil acts as a source of pollutants which move to hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere Soil mining agriculture involves taking something out of the soil plant nutrients organic matter the obvious response is to put something back in the modern approach has been to use processed fertilizers that replace only a few major nutrients the result is that the soil becomes depleted in some nutrients and in organic matter in other words, the soil is being mined which has negative implications for long-term soil fertility and agricultural sustainability Soil problems as creeping environmental problems Develop slowly from year to year Manageable in the short-term Irreversible in the long-term Play an important role in human history

Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Ecosystems Are the Most Complex Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living Some form symbiotic relationships with plants Fix enough nitrogen to be of significance Plants can grow in soils with low amounts of nitrogen Bacteria and fungi rapidly decompose nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively insoluble and contained in only certain kinds of rocks Weather out of rocks, transported to oceans Brought up by natural uplift of land masses or by marine animals Form rich natural deposits of guano from sea birds Millions of tons of phosphates added to farm land each year Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is called superphosphate Made by treating calcium phosphate with sulfuric acid Biogeochemical Cycles Illustrated: Recycling in a Forested Ecosystem Evidence in studies of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Central stream of large temperate deciduous forest \nwatershed Measure water and nutrient flow made through concrete weirs Conclusions: undisturbed watershed efficiently retained nutrients Instructive with regard to loss of rainforest area to crops Experimental felling of trees and shrubs in one of six watersheds Amount of water runoff increased by 40% Amount of nutrients lost was greatly increased Conclusion: fertility lost, danger of flooding increased THE FLOW OF ENERGY Ecosystems Contain Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Autotrophs capture light energy and manufacture own food Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs Energy captured is slowly released through metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs, sugarcane fields = 3600 to 9100 grams/year Intertidal zone = 14,600 grams/year Trophic Levels Green plants convert 1% of the sun`s energy Less energy converted by the animals that eat plants Levels of consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids cannot be inverted ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION Succession: Ecosystems Have a Tendency to Change from Simple to Complex Cleared land becomes occupied by larger and more diverse plants Small pond becomes filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of autotrophs Organisms at later stages are more specialized than earlier organisms [Return to Chapter 26 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools

at surface may be chemical or mechanical Chemical weathering requires water especially water that is slightly acidic due to contact with atmospheric CO 2 works best with warmer temperatures feldspars become clays limestone dissolves quartz is unaffected dissolved constituents end up in water: Na+, Ca++, Mg++, (HCO3)- plants may secrete chemicals that enhance chemical weathering Mechanical weathering (= physical weathering) fractures frost fire salt crystallization plant roots and burrowing animals Chemical and mechanical weathering work together mechanical weathering provides pathways for water, enhancing chemical weathering chemical weathering weakens the rock, enhancing mechanical weathering Weathering is a function of: climate (14.7) rock type / structure topography hydrology vegetation time / geologic history Erosion the transport of material at the earth's surface Agents of erosion gravity (mass-wasting) water (streams and oceans) suspended material dissolved material ice (glaciers) wind Erosion is a natural process but erosion of soil can be greatly accelerated by human activities (see below) Weathering and erosion work together, but they are two completely different concepts: weathering = decomposition erosion = transport Soil-forming processes An amazing set of astro-geo-bio-atmo-hydro-logical processes create the world's second-most valuable
