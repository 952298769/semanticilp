--> Large muscle between thorax and abdomen diaphragm --> Trachea --> Another name for wind pipe from mouth to lungs trachea --> Active transport --> Energy is used to move molecules against a concentration gradient active transport --> Oxygen debt --> When muscles respire anaerobically and produce lactic acid oxygen debt --> Aerobic respiration --> Release of energy from glucose using oxygen aerobic respiration --> Anaerobic respiration --> Release of energy from glucose in absence of oxygen anaerobic respiration --> Molecule --> Lots of atoms joined together molecule --> Lactic acid --> Produced in muscles during anaerobic respiration lactic acid --> Cilia --> Tiny hairs in the bronchi and bronchioles which move sheets of mucus out of the breathing system cilia --> Diffusion --> Movement of particles in a gas or liquid diffusion --> Haemoglobin --> Pigment found in red blood cells haemoglobin --> Oxyhaemoglobin --> Pigment in red blood cells when combined with oxygen oxyhaemoglobin --> Alveoli --> Tiny air sacs at end of bronchioles in the lungs alveoli --> Fatigued --> Tired muscles get fatigued fatigued --> Thorax --> Upper body chest thorax --> Abdomen --> Lower part of body where intestines are abdomen --> Bronchi --> Two main branches after trachea splits enter the left and right lungs bronchi --> Bronchioles --> Small branches in lungs bronchioles
