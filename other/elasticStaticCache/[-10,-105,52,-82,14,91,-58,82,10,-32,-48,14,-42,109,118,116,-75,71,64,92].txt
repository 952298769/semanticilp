impulses Breathing muscles are skeletal, but are under involuntary control Can be voluntarily over-ridden in hypo- or hyperventilation Reflex Pathway Prevents Life Threatening Alterations in Breathing No breathing causes increase in blood P CO2 Causes increase in carbonic acid, lowers blood pH Peripheral chemoreceptors in aortic and carotid bodies are sensitive to pH Send impulses to respiratory control center to reinitiate breathing Central chemoreceptors detect changes in pH of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fig 46.19 Peripheral chemoreceptors are responsible for immediate changes Central chemoreceptors are responsible for sustained changes Indefinite hyperventilation also prevented by chemoreceptors THE EVOLUTION OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS All Organisms Must Capture Nutrients and Gases from the Environment Simple organisms transport materials across membrane of each cell fig 46.20a Interior of large organisms cannot communicate with environment Fluids within body cavity facilitate movement of materials fig 46.20b Circulation: transport of materials through an internal fluid Types of Circulatory Systems Closed system: blood enclosed within vessels Circulating fluid does not mix with other body fluids Materials pass across by diffusion through walls of vessels Annelids have a closed system fig 46.20c Movement of fluid in vessels assisted by muscle contraction All vertebrates have closed circulatory system Open system: no distinction between circulating fluid and body fluid Arthropods have an open system fig 46.20d Muscular tube in body cavity pumps fluid through network of channels Fluid drains back into central cavity Advantage of closed systems Can change diameter of individual muscle-encased vessels Regulate fluid flow in specific parts of body independently THE FUNCTIONS OF VERTEBRATE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS Nutrient and Waste Transport Nutrients enter blood through wall of small intestine Carried to liver for storage or metabolism Dissolved glucose and metabolites carried to all body cells Metabolizing cells release wastes into blood Wastes carried to kidney for removal Constitutes metabolic circuit or systemic circulation Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Transport Oxygen diffuses into blood through gills or lungs Oxygen accumulates in hemoglobin of red blood cells fig 46.21 Oxygen released at metabolizing cells Carbon dioxide, a metabolic product, is released by cells into blood Waste carbon dioxide carried back to gills or lungs and released Constitutes respiratory circuit or pulmonary circulation Temperature Regulation Most vertebrates are poikilotherms, body temperature varies with environmental temperature Mammals and birds are homeotherms, maintain constant body temperature Heat distributed by circulating blood Temperature adjusted by directing flow to interior or extremities Decrease body temperature by dissipating heat to environment fig 46.22 Retain heat by directing blood from extremities to interior Some animals use countercurrent heat exchange system fig 46.23 Hormone Circulation Body activities coordinated by hormones produced in endocrine glands Hormones transported to target tissues throughout body Hormones persist only a short time, are destroyed by body enzymes THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Three Elements in a Vertebrate Closed Circulatory System Heart: muscular pump Blood vessels: tubes located through the body Blood: fluid circulating within vessels Heart and blood vessels comprise cardiovascular system Arteries: direct blood away from heart Arterioles: large network of smaller vessels, lead away from heart Capillaries: exchange with cells occurs across this fine network Venules: small vessels that collect blood from capillaries Veins: large vessels carry blood back to heart Anatomy of a Blood Vessel Similar structures found in arteries, arterioles, veins and venules fig 46.24 Walls are composed of four layers of tissue Innermost endothelium: epithelial sheet of cells Thick layer of elastic fibers Layer of smooth muscle Encased in connective tissue Walls too thick to permit exchange of materials Exchange occurs in capillaries, have only endothelium Arteries and Arterioles Carry Blood Away from the Heart Elastic fibers allow large artery to expand and recoil when receiving blood from heart Smaller arteries and arterioles are less elastic, but have thicker smooth muscle Network of small vessels provides flow resistance Inversely proportional to radius of the tube to the fourth power Small diameter arteries and arterioles cause greatest resistance to blood flow Contraction of smooth muscle causes vasoconstriction Increases resistance Decreases flow Relaxation of smooth muscle causes vasodilation Decreases resistance Increases flow Blood around some organs regulated by precapillary sphincters fig 46.25 Rings of smooth muscle around arterioles where they empty into capillaries Close off specific capillary beds to all blood flow Exchange Takes Place in the Capillaries Heart provides sufficient pressure to pump against resistance of arterial tree and into capillaries Every cell within 100 &#181;m of a \ncapillary Average capillary 1 mm long, 8 &#181;m wide, just larger than red blood cell fig 46.7 Capillaries have greatest cross-sectional area of all types of vessels Blood velocity decreases in capillary beds fig 46.27 Provides greater time for exchange of materials with extracellular fluid Blood releases oxygen and nutrients, picks up carbon dioxide and wastes Blood pressure greatly reduced when blood enters veins Veins and Venules Return Blood to the Heart Two main veins return systemic blood to heart Four veins return pulmonary blood back to heart (two from each lung) Veins and venules have thinner layer of smooth muscle than arteries fig 46.28 Pressure one-tenth that of arteries Most blood in body held in veins Can expand to hold greater quantities Venous pressure not sufficient to return blood to heart from feet and legs Aided by contraction of skeletal muscles One-way venous valves direct flow toward heart fig 46.29 The Lymphatic System Recovers Lost Fluid Circulatory system open to diffusion through capillary walls Filtration driven by pressure of blood, supplies cells with oxygen and nutrients Most fluid returned by osmosis due to concentration of protein in blood fig 46.30 Open lymphatic system collects rest of fluid and returns it to blood fig 46.31 Composed of lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and lymphatic organs like spleen and thymus Fluid in tissues drains into open-ended lymph capillaries Lymph passes into progressively larger vessels Lymphatic vessels contain vein-like one-way valves fig 46.32 Right lymphatic duct and thoracic duct drain into veins on side of neck Blockage of lymphatic systems leads to edema Lymph fluid movement assisted by movement of muscles Some lymph vessels contract rhythmically Some animals have lymph hearts Lymph modified by phagocytic cells in nodes and lymphatic organs Contain germinal centers for production of lymphocytes Thymus plays central role in immune system BLOOD The Plasma Is the Blood`s Fluid Blood plasma is a complex solution of three major components in water Metabolites and wastes Dissolved within are glucose, amino acids, vitamins Also includes wastes and hormones Ions Plasma is a dilute salt solution Primarily sodium, chloride and bicarbonate Trace amounts of calcium, magnesium and metallic ions Proteins Liver produces most plasma proteins, including albumin Alpha and beta globin proteins are carriers of lipids and steroid hormones Fibrinogen associated with blood clotting Serum is blood fluid minus the fibrinogen Plasma protein concentration maintain osmotic balance Erythrocytes Transport Oxygen Each milliliter of blood contains 5 billion erythrocytes or red blood cells Hematocrit: volume of blood composed of red blood cells, 45% of blood volume Each cell is a flat disk with a central depression fig 46.34 Collection of polysaccharides on outer membrane identify blood groups Mature mammal cells lack nuclei and protein-synthesis machinery Can not repair selves, have short life span of four months Removed by spleen, bone marrow, liver Cells produced in bone marrow during erythropoiesis Leukocytes Defend the Body Less than 1% of total blood cells Larger than red cells, contain no hemoglobin, virtually colorless Circulate in blood, present in interstitial fluid Function to defend body against microbes and foreign substances Granular leukocytes include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils Nongranular leukocytes include monocytes and lymphocytes Role in inflammatory response Injured cells release histamine Dilation of arterioles increases blood flow, makes area red and warm Neutrophils leave capillaries, accumulate at site of injury Joined by monocytes which are converted into macrophages Neutrophil and macrophages entrap microorganisms and foreign particles Lymphocytes play key role in antibody production Eosinophils may help defend against parasitic infections Platelets Help Blood to Clot Platelets are cell fragments that pinch off from megakaryocytes, no nuclei Play important role in blood clotting Ruptured vessel constricts due to contraction of smooth muscle in wall Platelets accumulate and form plug with tissues Fibrin protein glues platelets together Plug of platelets, fibrin and trapped red cells constitutes a blood clot Injury to tissues causes inactive clotting proteins in blood to become active Activated proteins are called clotting factors Cause cascade of reactions that produces thrombin from prothrombin Thrombin catalyzes conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin fig 46.35 THE EVOLUTION OF THE VERTEBRATE HEART Reflects Two Transitions in History of Vertebrates Shift from filter feeding to active capture of prey Invasion of land Evolved new breathing apparatus Decrease of pressure from sea to air Development of homeothermy The Early Chordate Heart Was a Peristaltic Pump Peristaltic contractions of muscular wall of ventral artery Pumps blood in both directions, greater flow in direction of wave The Fish Heart Is a One-Cycle Chamber Pump Four consecutive chambers fig 46.36 Two collection chambers: sinus venosus and atrium Two pumping chambers: ventricle and conus arteriosus Heartbeat sequence: sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, conus arteriosus Blood delivered to body tissues is fully oxygenated Flow: heart 9 gills 9 tissues 9 heart fig 46.37a, 38a Circulation to body is sluggish due to resistance in gill capillaries Amphibian and Reptile Hearts Reflect the Evolution of Pulmonary Circulation Evolution of large veins from lungs called pulmonary veins Altered blood flow: blood from lungs returns to heart for repumping Advantage: blood pumped to tissues at higher pressure Disadvantage: oxygenated blood mixed with unoxygenated blood Structure of the amphibian heart fig 46.38b Atrium divided into right and left chambers Conus arteriosus partially separated by a septum Imperfect separation of blood flow into pulmonary and systemic circulations Deficiency partly compensated for by cutaneous respiration Structure of the reptile heart fig 46.38c Ventricle partially divided by a septum Conus arteriosus absent, fully subdivided into arteries leaving heart Greater separation of aerated/nonaerated blood, greater efficiency Complete separation in crocodiles Mammal and Bird Hearts Are True Two-Cycle Pumps Independent evolution in birds and mammals Advent of a double circulatory system Ventricular septum prevents mixing of aerated/nonaerated blood fig 46.17d Left side of heart pumps oxygenated blood to body tissues Right side of heart pumps unoxygenated blood to lungs Evolution related to development of \nendothermy Same volume of blood moves through each circuit Left ventricle pumps blood through higher resistance pathway than right Left ventricle is more muscular and generates more pressure than right one The Pacemaker of Mammalian and Bird Hearts is a Remnant of the Sinus Venosus Sinus venosus served as collection chamber and pacemaker in early vertebrates Remaining tissue is site of origin of the heartbeat in mammals Located in wall of right atrium Called sinoatrial node (SA node) THE HUMAN HEART Double Pump System Operates Within a Single Organ Right side sends blood to lungs Left side sends blood to rest of body fig 46.39 Circulation Through the Heart fig 46.21 Cardiac cycle: complete journey of blood through body and heart Oxygenated blood from lungs carried through pulmonary veins to left atrium Blood flows from atrium to opening in left ventricle Movement occurs while ventricle is relaxing Period called ventricular diastole Ventricle about 80% full Contraction of right atrium produces final 20 % of blood volume to ventricle Ventricle contracts, called ventricular systole Blood forced out of left ventricle Bicuspid or mitral valve prevents backflow Blood moves one-way through aortic valve to aorta Backpressure of aorta closes aortic valve Prevents blood from reentering ventricle Aorta branches into systemic arteries fig 46.40 Carry oxygen-rich blood to all parts of body Heart receives blood via coronary arteries, not through ventricle Blood from body returns to heart via systemic veins The superior and inferior vena cava are collecting vessels Empty oxygen-depleted blood into right atrium Blood moves from right atrium through tricuspid valve to right ventricle Blood moves out of contracting right ventricle through pulmonary valve Blood pumped to lungs through pulmonary arteries Blood returns from lungs to left side of heart to complete cycle How the Heart Is Stimulated to Contract fig 46.22 Contraction stimulated by membrane depolarization, reversal of electrical polarity Contraction triggered by SA node fig 46.41 SA node is pacemaker Membrane of cells depolarize spontaneously with regular rhythm Depolarization passes from one cardiac muscle cell to another Spreads because cardiac cells are electrically coupled by gap junctions Ventricular wave of depolarization delayed by nearly 0.1 second Atria and ventricles separated by connective tissue Connective tissue cannot propagate depolarization Wave passes via atrioventricular node (AV node) Delay permits atria to completely empty before ventricles contract Depolarization conducted over both ventricles via bundle of His Transmitted by Purkinje fibers that stimulate ventricle myocardial cells Right and left ventricles contract almost simultaneously Monitoring the Heart`s Performance Monitor heart sounds caused by closing of heart valves First (lub): closing of mitral and tricuspid valves at start of ventricular systole Second (dub): closing of pulmonary and aortic valves at start of ventricular diastole Turbulence from improper closing of valve causes heart murmur Can also monitor changes in blood pressure Ventricles are relaxed during diastole Pressure in arteries at lowest Called diastolic pressure Contraction of ventricle during systole Pressure in arteries at highest Called systolic pressure Normal values: diastolic/systolic = 70-90 mm Hg/110-130 mm Hg Monitor electrocardiogram that records waves of depolarization Human body conducts electricity quite well Depolarization in heart generates electrical signals that spread throughout body Recording of signals called electrocardiogram fig 46.42 First deflection (P wave): depolarization associated with atrial contraction Second deflection (QRS): depolarization of ventricles Last deflection (T wave): ventricular repolarization Cardiac Output Output is the volume pumped by each ventricle per minute Calculated by: rate of heart beat x volume of blood ejected (stroke volume) Cardiac output is increased with exercise Heart rate increases: SA node is less inhibited by parasympathetic nervous system Sympathetic division stimulates heart rate to increase further Skeletal muscles squeeze on veins,returning blood to heart more rapidly Increases rate at which heart fills and ejects blood Sympathetic division and epinephrine make ventricles contract more strongly Ventricles empty more completely REGULATION OF BLOOD FLOW, PRESSURE AND VOLUME Two Factors Control Arteriolar Smooth Muscle Tension Extrinsic control by autonomic nervous system Intrinsic control, autoregulation Each organ gets enough blood for its own activities Increases blow flow to heart and skeletal muscles during exercise Ensures brain has continuous supply of blood Baroreceptor Reflex Baroreceptors located in walls of carotic artery and aortic arch fig 46.43 Respond to changes in systemic arterial blood pressure Connected to cardiovascular control center in medulla Firing rate decreases when blood pressure falls Stimulates sympathetic activity, inhibits parasympathetic activity Results in increased rate and force of heart contraction Restores normal pressure and cardiac output Baroreceptors act to maintain blood flow to brain with rapid standing Changes venous pressure in lower body, reduces pressure above heart Increases volume of blood in lower body Pressure in veins at right side of heart decreased Decreases cardiac output and blood flow to brain = fainting Reflex rapidly increases heart rate, constricts arterioles Maintains normal blood pressure values Effects of hemorrhage Severe blood loss reduces venous return, cardiac output gets dangerously low Reflex causes faster heart rate, vasoconstriction in skin and viscera Diverts blood to heart and brain Reverse action of baroreceptor reflex Rise in blood pressure promotes slowing of heart and vasodilation Lowers blood pressure toward normal values Volume Receptors Blood pressure depends partly on blood volume Higher blood volume means higher blood pressure Volume regulation via three homeostatic systems fig 46.44 Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) system ADH secreted by posterior pituitary with increased osmotic concentration of blood plasma Example: dehydration decreases volume, increases plasma concentration Stimulated thirst and ADH secretion ADH stimulates kidneys to reduce amount of water lost in urine Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system Secretion of aldosterone controlled by cascade that begins in kidney When blood flow through kidney is decreased, endocrine cells secrete renin Renin initiates conversion of plasma proteins to angiotensin I Converted to angiotensin II by enzyme in walls of blood vessels Angiotensin II has two effects Promotes vasoconstriction (raises blood pressure) Stimulates production of aldosterone by adrenal cortex Aldosterone increases total body Na+, reduces water loss Atrial natriuretic hormone ( \nANH) system Responds to need to excrete Na+ and lower blood volume Inhibits aldosterone secretion ANH secreted by endocrine cells in atrial walls when atrium is stretched by high blood volume Inhibits secretion of renin by kidney, inhibits aldosterone release More Na+ excreted in urine, water follows, blood volume lowered THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF CIRCULATION Ability to Circulate Materials to All Cells in the Body Other Body Systems
