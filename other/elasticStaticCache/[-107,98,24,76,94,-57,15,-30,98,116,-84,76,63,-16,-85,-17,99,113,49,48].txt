5 Human Organ Systems Identify the cell as the basic unit of life Describe the basic structure and function of the major organs in the respiratory, circulatory, digestive, excretory, and nervous systems Describe ways in which the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems work together to produce movement Formulate questions about and identify the needs of humans, and explore possible answers to these questions and ways of meeting these needs Explain the importance of daily physical activity 8 Cells, Tissues, Organs and Systems Describe the organization of cells into tissues, organs, and systems Describe the needs and functions of various cells and organs in relationship to the needs of the human body as a whole Describe the basic factors that contribute to the efficient functioning of the human respiratory, circulatory, digestive, excretory, and nervous systems Describe some ways in which the various systems in the human body are interdependent Describe ways in which substances work by altering the ways cells function Describe ways in which various types of cells contribute to the healthy functioning of the human body Illustrate how blood is pushed by pressure throughout the body to carry oxygen and nutrients to cells, tissues, and organs Biology Grade Topic Expectations 11 Academic Internal System & Regulation Describe the process of ventilation and gas exchange from the environment Explain the role of transport or circulatory systems in the transport of substances in an organism Demonstrate an understanding of how fitness level is related to the efficiency of metabolism and of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems Science Grade Topic Expectations 11 Body Input & Body Function Identify factors that contribute to energy use in the body Health and Physical Education Grade 11 and 12 (to be implemented in 2001 and 2002) Strand: Exercise Science Grade Topic Expectations 12 Academic The Biological Basis of Movement Use correct anatomical terminology when describing human performance Describe the various parts of the skeletal and muscular systems, and the ways in which they relate to human performance Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between the cardiorespiratory system and the production of energy Describe the acute and chronic effects of physical activity on the body Educational Programs Home Page Version en
