Europe it was much warmer than it is now continental glaciers alternately advanced and retreated over large portions of North America and Europe tropical vegetation was growing over vast regions of the Central Plains of North America The Milankovitch Theory proposes that climatic changes are due to: variations in the Earth's orbit as it travels through space volcanic eruptions changing levels of CO 2 in the Earth's atmosphere particles suspended in the Earth's atmosphere A rainshadow desert is normally found: in the center of a large surface anticyclone on the back (western) side of a large thunderstorm in polar regions where the air is cold and dry in the center of the ITCZ on the downwind side of a mountain range Oxygen isotope analysis cannot be used to identify changes in temperature in: sea-shells ice cores ocean floor sediment cores rocks and minerals The end of the last Ice Age promoted the following changes to the landscape: melting of large amounts \nof ice rise of sea level prolonged rise of those land areas that had been weighted down by the masses of ice advances of forests to regions with tundra and grassy plains all of the above During the Little Ice Age: the climatic optimum occurred the Bering land Bridge formed alpine glaciers grew in size and advanced continental glaciers covered large portions of North America sea level lowered by about 280 ft A
