- shallow-focus earthquakes (&lt;70 km) due to the interaction of cold dense slabs of oceanic crust with the overriding lithosphere - intermediate-focus earthquakes (70-300 km) generated similar to shallow-focus earthquakes - deep-focus earthquakes (&gt;300 km) due to mineral phase transformation (olivine-spinel) which produces &quot;brittle&quot; response to stresses 24 CHAPTER 19 PLATE
