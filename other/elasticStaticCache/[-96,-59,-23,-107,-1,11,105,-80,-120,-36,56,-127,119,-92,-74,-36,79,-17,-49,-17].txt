that are not native to your area including red eared sliders, map turtles, and snapping turtles) The turtles will die from diseases that are very painful such as pneumonia, shell rot, and soft shell Turtles polute the wilderness and make it hard for native species such as ducks, and fish to survive, due to pollution and lack of food sources turtles are not used to hibernating during the winter, and being out in the wold forces them to do this, which causes bacterial infection, low immune system, and digestive difficulties turtles in the wild have no fear of natural predators, putting both the turtles and the predators at risk The overpopulation of red eared sliders in B.C causes problems with food shortage, and habitat loss for native species Turtle intoduce diseases to susceptible
