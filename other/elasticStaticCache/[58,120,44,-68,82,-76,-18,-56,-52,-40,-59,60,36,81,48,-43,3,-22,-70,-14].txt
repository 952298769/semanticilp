As they are most familiar, we will consider the life cycle of a pine tree. As an adult, mature tree, the pine produces two different types of cones, pollen cones (male) and ovulate cones (female). The male gametophytes exist within special sacs as pollen grains, while the female gametophytes, the eggs, are held within ovules, protected by a layer called the integument. The integument has a single opening, called the micropyle.  An ovule may hold one or more eggs.   When the pollen grains are mature they are released and borne by the wind to the ovules' micropyles. If they are accepted by the ovule, the pollen grains germinate and produce a tube leading into the integument. The sperm, held within the pollen grains, pass down these tubes and meet the eggs, which they fertilize. When the eggs are fertilized, the integument thickens into a seed coat, to protect the embryonic plant within. The seed also has nutritive tissues which supply food for the embryo until the seed can germinate and the plant can produce food for itself through photosynthesis. The seed, when developed and mature, is released in a variety of ways, including wind dispersal. If it finds suitable growing conditions where it lands, the seed will germinate and develop into a new plant, capable on maturity of producing more seeds and continuing the cycle.",2.117379665374756],["Does a seed have as much life as the \ntree it grows into?",2.107811689376831],["A female North Pacific Giant Octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) lives three to four years; it lays thousands of eggs in a single bout and then dies. By contrast, a mature Coast Redwood Tree (Sequoia sempervirens) lives for many hundreds of years and produces millions of seeds each year (Figure 1). As these two examples illustrate, organisms differ dramatically in how they develop, the time they take to grow, when they become mature, how many offspring of a particular size they produce, and how long they live.

Pollen is released and carried by wind to the female cone, where it lands and germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows into the female gametophyte. The sperm cell and egg cell fuse, forming the next generation sporophyte. The sporophyte develops into an embryo encased in a seed. The seed is later released to be transported by the wind to where (hopefully) it lands and germinates.
