Chapter 53 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Reproductive Process Two haploid gametes fuse to form diploid zygote Zygote grows into a multicellular individual fig 53.1 Events that Occur After Fertilization Comprise the Process of Development Process is fundamentally similar in all vertebrates Occurs in six stages tbl 53.1 INITIAL STAGE OF REPRODUCTION: FERTILIZATION Fertilization Is the Union of Male and Female Gametes External process in fish and amphibians \nInternal in other vertebrates Sperm: male gametes are small, motile cells Eggs: female gametes are very large cells Sperm introduced into female reproductive tract Encounter oocyte in fallopian tube, location of fertilization Penetration Egg released from fully developed Graafian follicle at ovulation Surrounded by several protective layers fig 53.2 Outer layer is granulosa cells that surrounded it in follicle Zona pellucida glycoprotein layer Egg plasma membrane Sperm advances through these layers Acrosome contains enzymes to digests way through two outer layers Sperm meets egg plasma membrane Egg cytoplasm bulges, engulfs head of sperm, permits entry of its nucleus fig 53.3 Activation Egg activation initiated by sperm penetration Frogs, reptiles, birds: many sperm enter egg, first one fertilizes it Mammals: penetration alters egg membrane, prevents further entry Completion of meiosis: produce haploid nucleus, second polar body Rearrangement of egg cytoplasm Movements establish bilateral symmetry of developing individual Example: formation of gray crescent in frogs fig 53.4 Egg can be activated with physical stimulation, development may continue parthenogenetically Fusion Fusion of sperm nucleus with egg nucleus Triggered by activation of the egg No fusion of nuclei if sperm nucleus injected without activation SETTING THE STAGE FOR DEVELOPMENT: CELL CLEAVAGE Rapid Division of Zygote into a Greater Number of Sequentially Smaller Cells Not accompanied by an increase in the size of the zygote Formation of the morula: 32 tightly packed cells Each cell called a blastomere Each blastomere contains a different component of cytoplasm Further divisions result in the formation of a hollow blastula Cells surround a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel Cell Cleavage Pattern Is Influenced by Presence of the Yolk fig 53.5 Primitive chordates fig 53.6 Egg has little or no yolk Holoblastic cleavage: occurs through the entire egg Example: lancets and agnathans Forms a symmetrical blastula with equally sized cells Amphibians and advanced fish fig 53.7 Egg has more yolk in one hemisphere, division of yolk-laden cells is slow Holoblastic cleavage forms asymmetrical blastula Large cells with yolk at one pole Mass of small yolk-poor cells at other pole Reptiles and birds fig 53.8 Egg almost entirely yolk, small amount of cytoplasm at one pole Meroblastic cleavage occurs in blastodisc of polar cytoplasm Blastoderm is not spherical, but like a thin cap upon the yolk Mammals fig 53.9 Egg contains little yolk, cleavage is holoblastic Inner cell mass localized at one pole, similar to reptile blastodisc Trophoblast: outer cell mass analogous to reptile egg covering, contributes to placenta The Blastula Regardless of appearance, cells of blastula differ from one another Sizes are different which effects rate of division Contain different portions of cytoplasm Contact with different sets of neighboring cells Cells contain signal substances that affect development Substances clustered at specific sites Sites genetically determined by maternal chromosomes Cytoplasm reoriented with respect to site of sperm entry Signals endow different daughter cells with developmental instructions Egg is prepatterned: pattern of cytoplasm determines developmental fate of embryonic cells THE ONSET OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGE: GASTRULATION Gastrulation: First Visible Result of Prepatterning Certain groups of cells move inward from surface Events determine basic developmental pattern of vertebrate embryo Results in formation of primary germ cell layers tbl 53.2 Ectoderm forms epidermis and neural tissue Mesoderm gives rise to connective tissue, muscle, vascular elements Endoderm forms lining of gut and its derivatives Mechanism of cell movement Cells creep over stationary cells by actin filament contraction Migrating cells adhere via similar genetic surface polysaccharides Alternative Patterns of Gastrulation Primitive chordates and most aquatic vertebrates Process in organisms that develop from symmetrical blastulas Surface of blastula bulges into blastocoel Half of blastula's cells move into interior Forms two-layered, cup-shaped gastrula Hollow crater is the archenteron which becomes the gut Opening of archenteron is the blastopore which becomes the anus Gastrulation produces an outer ectoderm and an inner endoderm Mesoderm forms from pouches pinched off the endoderm Primary tissues determine destiny of subsequent tissues and organs In organisms with symmetrical yolk distribution Invagination at vegetal pole not physically possible Layer of cells from animal pole folds over yolk-rich cells, invaginate inward Dorsal lip: site of invagination fig 53.10 Eliminates blastocoel Cavity called archenteron, opening is the blastopore Blastopore filled with yolk-rich cells, called yolk plug Outer layer of cells is the ectoderm, inner layer is the endoderm Mesoderm forms by migration of dorsal lip cells Reptiles, birds and mammals fig 53.11 Two sides of blastodisc not separated by yolk Cell layers differentiate without movement Lower layer becomes endoderm Upper layer becomes ectoderm Mesoderm arises from invagination of cells of upper layer fig 53.12 Site of invagination appears as a furrow on the blastodisc surface Called the primitive streak, analogous to elongated blastopore Formation of primitive streak constitutes gastrulation THE DETERMINATION OF BODY ARCHITECTURE: NEURULATION Neurulation: Formation of Notochord and Hollow Dorsal Nerve Cord Process occurs only in chordates First notochord forms from mesoderm along embryo midline Next neural groove forms from ectoderm above the notochord fig 53.13 Layer of ectoderm invaginates Edges of groove move together, fuse and form the neural tube Neural tube differentiates into spinal cord and brain Changes in Mesoderm Affect Whole Body Architecture Formation of blocks of tissue called somites Progressively more somites formed during development Give rise to muscles, vertebrae and connective tissue Some body organs develop within strip of mesoderm bordering the somites Remaining mesoderm moves around, surrounds inner endoderm layer Forms hollow tube of mesoderm within the endoderm Space within tube is the coelom Endoderm layers eventually form lining of digestive tact EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF THE VERTEBRATES: THE NEURAL CREST Formation of Neural Crest Occurs Only in Vertebrates Strip of Neural Crest Cells Become Incorporated into Roof of Neural Tube fig 53.13c,d Cells shift to sides of embryo Eventually develop into characteristic vertebrate structures Anterior portions merge with forebrain Clusters of associated ectodermal cells thicken into placodes Develop into parts of the sense organs located on the \nhead Sense organs occur in pairs as a result of the two lateral strips Remaining cells migrate from nerve tube, pass through tissues Structures Derived from the Neural Crest The gill chamber fig 53.14 Elaborated from pharyngeal slits Cells form cartilaginous bars, nerves, induces formation of muscle Greatly improved respiration, allowed active predation Elaboration of the nervous system Cells migrate to notochord Form sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia Become specialized as Schwann cells Form autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla Important to sympathetic nervous system Similarity of epinephrine and norepinephrine related to cell derivation Sensory organs and skull Olfactory and lateral line organs develop from placodes Teeth and cranial bones develop from neural crest cells The Role of the Neural Crest in Vertebrate Evolution fig 53.15 Adaptations of neural crest cells promoted predatorial activities Resultant increased metabolic rate allowed for greater activity THE EVOLUTION OF DEVELOPMENT Patterns of Development Reflect Patterns that Occur in Earlier Forms Bird and mammal development elaborate upon reptile development Reptile development elaborates upon amphibian development Traces of relic structures may be visible in early stages of development Patterns of Development Are Built upon One Another in Incremental Steps Instructions are layered upon other instructions Haeckel`s \"biogenic law\": ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny The course of vertebrate development involves the same changes that occurred over the course of vertebrate evolution Not literally a true phrase Embryonic stages reflect embryonic ancestors not adult ancestors HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Human Development Closely Resembles Chick Development Flattened blastodisk forms a primitive streak Gives rise to three primary cell types Takes a significantly longer time First Trimester The first month Cleavage divisions occur within 30 hours after fertilization Embryo continues to travel down fallopian tube to uterus Embryo in uterus is a blastula, blastocyst in mammals Inner mass of cells and surrounding layer of trophoblast cells fig 53.9 Embryo divides and initiates formation of two membranes Amnion encloses embryo Chorion develops from trophoblast Interacts with uterine tissue Forms placenta Blastocyst implants into endometrial lining of uterus Processes of second week Chorion forms branched extensions, chorionic frondosum Protrude into endometrium fig 53.16 Induce endometrial tissue to become decidua basalis Chorionic frondosum and decidua basalis form placenta Mother's and embryo's blood in close proximity, do not mix fig 53.17 Placenta and vascularization provides for Exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide Nourishment for embryo Detoxifies certain molecules in embryo Secretes hormones like chorionic gonadotropin, chorionic somatomammotropin Gastrulation occurs in second week, primary tissues differentiated Neurulation occurs in the third week, somites visible Organogenesis occurs in the fourth week fig 53.18a Pregnancy may not yet be detected The second month Morphogenesis occurs, body begins to take shape fig 53.18b Limbs and body organs are recognizable The third month Nervous system and sense organs develop fig 53.18c Limbs show movement, muscle activities begin All major organs established Developing individual called a fetus Hormonal events Placental secretion of CG declines, corpus luteum regresses No menstruation since placenta secretes estradiol and progesterone fig 53.19 Inhibit release of FSH and LH Prevent ovulation Maintain uterus, prepare for labor and delivery Stimulate development of mammary glands for lactation Second Trimester Growth occurs during the fourth and fifth months fig 53.18d Body covered with fine hair called lanugo Kicking and heartbeat detected Significant growth occurs in sixth month Third Trimester Predominantly a growth period, weight doubles several times Major nerve tracts of brain formed Neurological development continued after birth Birth must occur early to ensure passage through pelvis fig 53.20 Birth occurs as soon as survivability is high Nutrients supplied via placenta Birth In some mammals, changing hormone levels in the fetus initiate birth Have extra cell layer in adrenal cortex, called fetal zone Fetal pituitary secretes corticotropin Stimulates fetal zone to release steroid hormones Maternal placenta produces prostaglandins, induces contractions Human birth not initiated by this mechanism Uterus releases prostaglandins as a result of high levels of placental estradiol Estradiol stimulates uterus to produce more oxytocin receptors Uterus becomes more sensitive to oxytocin Prostaglandins begin contractions Sensory feedback stimulates release of oxytocin After birth, continued contractions expel the placenta and membranes Umbilical cord is tied and cut Nursing Milk production called lactation Occurs in alveoli of mammary glands fig 53.21 Milk secreted into alveolar ducts Progesterone stimulates development of mammary alveoli Estradiol stimulates development of alveolar ducts Estradiol blocks actions of prolactin, inhibits prolactin secretion During pregnancy, mammary glands prepared for lactation, prevented from lactating Decline in progesterone and estradiol when placenta discharged after birth Anterior pituitary secretes prolactin, mammary alveoli produce milk Sustained by suckling stimuli, oxytocin produces milk-ejection reflex First milk produced is colostrum: nutritious, rich in antibodies Important pair bonding occurs during nursing fig 53.22 Nursing may occur for one year or more At end of nursing, milk accumulation causes prolactin secretion to stop Accumulation of milk inhibits production of milk POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT Rapid Growth Continues After Birth Body proportions are different as organs grow at different rates Head is disproportionately large, grows more slowly Allometric pattern of growth Differential Growth of Head Most mammals exhibit extensive brain growth as fetuses Vast differences in appearance between infant and adult Growth of cerebral portions decelerates, jaw continues to grow Humans are an exception Little difference in appearance between infant and adult humans Both brain and jaw grow
