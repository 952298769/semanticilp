for the collection, display and analysis of data using technology as required It is expected \nthat students will: read and interpret graphs discuss how collected data are affected by the nature of the sample, the method of collection, the sample size and biases describe issues to be considered when collecting data (e.g., appropriate language, ethics, cost, privacy, cultural sensitivity) select, defend and use appropriate methods of collecting data: designing and using questionnaires interviews experiments research determine and use measures of central tendency to support decisions use sample data to make predictions and decisions use suitable graph types to display data (by hand or using technology) critique ways in which statistical information and conclusions are presented by the media
