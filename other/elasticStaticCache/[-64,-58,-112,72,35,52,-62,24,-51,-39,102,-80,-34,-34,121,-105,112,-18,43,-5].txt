happened to her life She takes a drink from a glass Trying to forget about her past She watches the knife move to her wrist She sees this as if in a mist The cut is made and she feels no pain She feels like she&#146;s going insane The blood flows freely from her arm But it&#146;s not enough to do any harm The hand with the knife cuts again This time hoping for the end All her life she tried to
