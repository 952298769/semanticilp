Stems are erect, ridged, rough and hairy, and frequently branched, resulting in somewhat bushy plants from 8 to 59 inches (20-150 cm) tall. It has small, green unisexual flowers occurring in separate clusters at the end of the branches and main stem. The fruit is a brown, hard, woody bur from 0.4 to 0.8 inch long and covered with stout, hooked prickles. Each fruit contains two seeds [ 32 ]. RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : Therophyte REGENERATION PROCESSES : Because it is an annual, rough cocklebur reproduces by seed only. Plants top-killed early in the growing season may sprout from the root crown. Pollination and fruit production: Pollen transfer is by wind. The plant is self-compatible and predominantly self-pollinated. Common cocklebur may also set seed without fertilization of the ovule. Because of self-compatibility and apomixis, local populations are often genetically very similar. A single, open-grown plant typically produces 400 to 500 fruits [ 14 , 32 ]. Fruit dispersal: The fruits cling to the hide of animals and the clothing of humans and are dispersed in that manner. Fruits not transported by animals fall from the plant during the fall or winter [ 18 , 32 ]. In riparian habitats, fruits on the soil surface may later be dispersed by water as they float for up to 30 days [ 32 ]. The fruit does not dehisce, and thus seeds germinate within the fruit. Seed viability, dormancy, and germination: Seed viability is usually high, at least 80 percent [ 32 ]. Each bur contains two seeds, one larger than the other. The large seed is nondormant and typically germinates the first spring following production, while the smaller seed germinates later in the season or, more frequently, the following year [ 32 ]. Occasionally, the two seeds germinate simultaneously. Depth of burial also influences germination. Seeds lying on the soil surface and those buried more than 6 inches (15 cm) below the soil surface rarely germinate. In Illinois, seed buried in November at various depths in silty loam soil began to emerge after April 1 and continued emerging until May 19. Maximum seedling emergence was from seed buried at 1 or 2 inches (2.5 and 5.1 cm) [ 27 ]. Another study found that 11 to 16 percent of rough cocklebur seeds germinated after 30 months of burial at depths ranging from 3 to 9 inches (8-38 cm) [ 6 ]. SITE CHARACTERISTICS : Rough cocklebur occurs primarily in disturbed, open habitats. It grows in cultivated fields, vacant lots, sandpits, and dry washes; on beaches and sand dunes; and along the shores of ponds and rivers, especially riverbeds left barren by receding floodwaters [ 14 , 18 , 28 , 32 ]. In noncultivated settings, it primarily occupies beaches and dunes in eastern North America and floodplains in the West. In ruderal habitats, such as agricultural fields, rough cocklebur often occurs in dense stands, but in natural habitats, such as along shorelines, it often occurs as scattered individuals [ 18 , 32 ]. Rough cocklebur is tolerant of a variety of soil conditions ranging from moist clay to dry sand but grows best on compact sandy soil that is slightly moist below the soil surface and contains a small amount of organic matter [ 32 ]. It is tolerant of flooding at all growth stages [ 32 ]. Herbaceous associates in various habitats are as follows [ 10 , 17 , 20 , 26 ]: Habitat Associated Herbs dry, scoured washes within wild mustard (Brassica campestris) southern California white sweetclover (Melilotus albus) chaparral (Ceanothus spp.- Artemisia spp.) moist and alkaline beds of Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis) intermittent water courses in prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) the Missouri River Breaks of foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum) Montana Mexican dock (Rumex mexicanus) yellow sweetclover (M. officinalis) cottonwood (Populus fremontii) prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) bottomland along the South cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) Platte River in Colorado hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum) curly dock (R. crispus) guara (Guara parviflora) poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) common reed (Phragmites australis) coastal beaches and sandpits sea-rocket (Cakile edentula) of Massachusetts seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens) SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : Obligate Initial Community Species Rough cocklebur is a weed of ruderal (sandpits, old fields, cultivated fields, etc.) and naturally disturbed habitats (beaches, dunes, and floodplains) [ 1 , 18 , 28 ]. As a pioneer, it persists only as long as the ground remains mostly bare and the site remains unshaded. It rarely grows in sod, and plants will not flower or fruit in full shade [ 18 , 32 ]. SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : Seed germination: Illinois - April through mid-May, with lesser numbers through June. Small germination flushes occur throughout the summer with adequite moisture [ 32 ]. southern Ontario - late May [ 32 ]. Flowering: Flowering is controlled by photoperiod. The plant will not flower at all or only poorly when day length exceeds 14 hours. Thus in the northern portion of its range, flowering does not occur until late summer [ 18 ]. Flowering time by state is as follows: Carolinas - July to frost [ 23 ] Colorado - July to October [ 5 ] Kansas - July to November [ 1 ] Montana - August to September [ 5 ] North Dakota - July to September [ 5 ] Wyoming - July to September [ 34 ] Utah - July to September [ 34 ] Seed dispersal: Seeds ripen in the fall.

In reality in algae and plants, there are a few more stages in the process, thus we now need to revisit this cycle. The 2n generation, which in humans is called an _adult,_ in algae and plants is called a sporophyte because it produces spores. Within specialized reproductive structures in/on the bodies of the sporophyte, meiosis occurs to reduce the chromosome number from 2n to 1n, thus the spores which are produced are 1n. What is very significant, here, is that meiosis produces 1n spores, not gametes. Each spore germinates and grows into a new, independent, 1n organism (which often looks totally different than the 2n generation). These 1n organisms are called gametophytes because they produce the gametes (eggs and sperm), which are still 1n. Then, as we_ve seen in the past, an egg and sperm unite by syngamy (fertilization) increasing the chromosome number from 1n to 2n, and forming a zygote which is 2n. The zygote grows into the sporophyte, and the cycle starts over. Various of the green algae go through this cycle as do members of the next two groups, the brown and red algae.

Plants have a more complex life cycle than animals, alternating between two heteromorphic generations: the sporophyte and the gametophyte. In the diploid sporophyte, distinct cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. These give rise to multicellular haploid gametophytes, which produce gametes through mitotic divisions. The fusion of a male (sperm) and a female (egg) gamete results in the formation of a zygote, which constitutes the sporophyte. The example depicted, Hieracium pilosella, follows the common life cycle of angiosperms. The anthers of the flower produce the male gametophyte (called the pollen or microgametophyte), which consists of three cells: two sperm cells (SC) and one vegetative cell (VC). The female gametophyte (called the embryo sac or megagametophyte) is embedded in maternal sporophytic tissues of the ovule. The latter is enclosed in the carpels of the flower. For sexual reproduction, the pollen needs to germinate on the stigma and to deliver the two sperm cells to the female gametophyte. Fertilization, the transition from the gametophytic to the sporophytic generation, occurs within the ovule. In addition to sexual reproduction, plants can frequently reproduce asexually, e.g. by stolon outgrowth (vegetative reproduction) or via the formation of calli in culture, followed by somatic embryogenesis and development into an adult plant.

The cells can go through binary fusion which causes the filament to grow lengthwise.  If the filament is broken it grows on its own.  This process helps disperse the algae.  The sexual reproduction of Spirogyra involves the process of conjugation.  Two filaments form connecting tubes and the content of one cell flows into the other.  The wall thickens around the zygote forming a zygospore that can survive harsh conditions;  Ulothrix is a filament that can reproduce sexually and asexually.  When  it reproduces sexually, it produces 8-64 isogametes inside a cell.  Each of the gametes have two flagella, which help them swim together and unite when released from the mother cell.  When the cells unite, they form a zygote which later becomes a zygospore.  Asexually, The Ulothrix reproduces by forming 4-8 zoospores in a cell.  The zoospore contains 4 flagella which help them swim away to form new colonies; Ulva is most commonly known as sea lettuce.  It has a life cycle that involves two distinct forms of the organism.  The two forms may look alike, but they are genetically different.  One of the forms is haploid (meaning they have [n] chromosomes).  The haploid form of the organism is called gametophyte because it produces gametes.  When two gametes fuse they form a diploid zygote.  All of the cells that are developed form that zygote are diploid. The resulting diploid form is called a sporophyte because its cells undergo meiosis and therefore will produce spores.  Each haploid spore will develop into a haploid gametophyte.  The alteration between the sporophyte and the gametophyte stages in the life cycle is called alteration of generations.  All plants and many types of algae go through this process of alteration of generations.  This life cycle is widespread because it has great survival value.  The species benefit from the recombination of parents' traits through the fusion of gametes and from the opportunity to reproduce by the less risky process of forming spores.  The gametophytes and the sporophytes look identical in this specie, but in other plants, the two forms may look very different.",1.148957371711731],["...Seed Germination Some people, when they think of germination, think of a seed sprouting.

Leaves, stems, and flowers are sparsely to moderately covered with stinging hairs.  Two subspecies, American stinging nettle and hoary nettle, are native; the third subspecies in North America, European stinging nettle, was introduced in the mid-1800's.  American stinging nettle and hoary nettle are predominantly monoecious whereas European stinging nettle is typically dioecious.  The fruit is an achene [ 1 , 51 ]. Stinging nettle has both epigeal and shallow subterranean rhizomes [ 35 ]. RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : Hemicryptophyte REGENERATION PROCESSES : Stinging nettle reproduces vegetatively and by seed. Stinging nettle produces abundant seed.  Plants growing in the shade produce approximately 500 to 5,000 seeds per shoot and plants growing in full sunlight produce 10,000 to 20,000 seeds per shoot.  Seeds remain on the plant until frost when they fall to the ground.  Seeds are not dormant and can germinate 5 to 10 days after maturity [ 1 ].  Buried stinging nettle seeds persist an undetermined length of time in the seedbank [ 7 , 26 , 33 , 34 , 44 ].  Stinging nettle seedlings emerged from unflooded substrate samples collected from the Delta Marsh, Manitoba [ 33 ].  Stinging nettle seeds, mostly buried less than 2 inches (5 cm) deep, occurred in the seedbanks of three forest communities in Idaho [ 26 ].  Stinging nettle seedlings emerged from soil samples collected from a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)/common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) habitat type in Washington.  April collections contained 48 stinging nettle seeds per square foot (533/sq m) and October collections contained 6 seeds per square foot (67/sq m).  Most stinging nettle seeds were buried less than 4 inches (10 cm) deep, but some were present to 10 inches (25 cm) [ 34 ].  Stinging nettle seeds have germinated in the greenhouse after 10 years of storage [ 1 ]. Stinging nettle spreads and reproduces vegetatively by rhizomes. Seedlings initiate vegetative spread in the first growing season.  A rhizome planted in late summer can spread into an 8.2 foot (2.5 m) diameter area by the following year [ 1 ]. Stinging nettle has a strong shoot thrust.  The ability to generate mechanical force enables the plant to extend its shoots vertically into dominant aerial positions [ 6 ]. SITE CHARACTERISTICS : Stinging nettle occurs in moist sites along streams, coulees, and ditches, on mountain slopes, in woodland clearings, and in disturbed areas.  Stinging nettle generally grows on deep, rich soils [ 1 , 51 ]. American stinging nettle occurs from sea level to subalpine elevations. Hoary nettle occurs from sea level to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) elevation in the southern part of its range and from 2,300 to 6,600 feet (700-2,000 m) elevation in the northern part of its range [ 51 ].  Stinging nettle persists in northern climates, spreading vegetatively rather than by seed [ 40 ]. Stinging nettle occurs both in wetlands and in uplands.  It is a facultative wetland species [ 36 ].  Stinging nettle is present in the seasonally flooded emergent zone of oxbow lakes along the Connecticut River [ 22 ].  Persistent flooding kills stinging nettle [ 20 ]. SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : Stinging nettle is probably intermediate in shade tolerance.  It occurs and produces seed in shady habitats but produces more seed in full sun [ 1 ]. Stinging nettle establishes colonies from which other plants are virtually excluded.  Competition from grass may limit the spread of stinging nettle clones [ 1 ] Stinging nettle invades disturbed sites.  It invades forest plantations in Great Britain when bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) is artificially removed [ 5 ].  Stinging nettle colonizes wetland sites when water levels drop [ 20 , 33 ].  It is an increaser on periodically flooded areas along Idaho streams [ 37 ]. SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : Stinging nettle sends new shoots up each year from perennating buds on rhizomes.  Maximum root development occurs in the spring prior to flowering.  American stinging nettle flowers from late May to October, European stinging nettle flowers from June to October, and hoary nettle flowers from July to October.  In northern areas, flowering is condensed into a shorter time period, ending in late August [ 1 , 51 ].",1.0782965421676636],["From the strategy of winter survival among animalsxburrowing, hibernation and migrationxto the processes by which plants germinate, grow, flower, and spread their seeds across the continents, this film celebrates the world of animals, insects, planets . . . and human beings.",1.0775789022445679],["From the strategy of winter survival among animalsxburrowing, hibernation and migrationxto the processes by which plants germinate, grow, flower, and spread their seeds across the continents, this film celebrates the world of animals, insects, planets&#133; and human beings.",1.0775789022445679],["In flowering plants (Angiosperms), the pollen grain from the male plant is dispersed via wind, insect pollinators and animals.

The offspring may be capable of sexual reproduction, if this mode exists in the species. A parthenogenetic offspring is sometimes called a parthenogen. As with all types of asexual reproduction , there are both costs (low genetic diversity and susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis. Asexual reproduction existed alone from the beginning of life on Earth for many epochs . When sexual reproduction arose (presumably through mutation) it introduced a means to expand genetic diversity through the partial contribution of the male, providing more options for the survival of the species in which it began. Many species followed this reproductive path successfully, some to the exclusion of the asexual pattern from which it arose, some enabling both, some retaining the capacity to revert to asexual reproduction—if necessary, and yet others that abandoned sexual reproduction and reverted to the asexual.

The products of schizogony are called merozoites and they are stored in structures known as schizonts. Protozoans may also reproduce sexually, which increases genetic diversity and can lead to complex life cycles. Protozoans can produce haploid gametes that fuse through syngamy. However, they can also exchange genetic material by joining to exchange DNA in a process called conjugation. This is a different process than the conjugation that occurs in bacteria.
