volcanic islands Resembled forms on mainland, not distant places fig 1.10 Supports evolution, refutes independent creation Darwin and Malthus Malthus wrote Essay on the Principles of Population Populations of organisms increase geometrically fig 1.11 Food supply increases arithmetically Unchecked population could reproduce to fill the world Nature acts to check population growth via death Darwin concluded evolution dependent on natural selection Natural Selection Organisms produce more offspring than will survive Surviving organisms are superior in certain attributes fig 1.12 Pass these characters to offspring Changes nature of population as a whole Similar in intent to artificial selection Selection for traits practiced by breeders Animals breed true for traits concentrated in them Example: domestic pigeons PUBLICATION OF DARWIN'S THEORY First Draft Completed in 1842, Years of Refinement Letter from Wallace with Same Ideas Stimulated Completion and Presentation Some Views Not Accepted, Including Man Evolving From Apes EVOLUTION AFTER DARWIN: TESTING THE THEORY Collection of Evidence by Darwin and Contemporaries The Fossil Record Darwin predicted links between groups of organisms fig 1.13 Microscopic fossils 3.5 billion years old Graded series of vertebrate fossils The Age of the Earth, 4.5 Billion Years, Determined by Radioactive Decay The Mechanisms of Heredity Genes unknown at Darwin's time Laws of inheritance explain genetic variation Comparative Anatomy Comparison of vertebrate forelimb bones fig 1.14 Homologous structures: same origin, different structure and function Analogous structures: similar structure and function, different origin Molecular Biology Sequence of DNA provides genetic information Construct family trees and estimate rates of evolution Measure degree of change in DNA code Compare to known fossil evidence fig 1.15 Development Similarities in developmental stages of species fig 1.16 \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"
