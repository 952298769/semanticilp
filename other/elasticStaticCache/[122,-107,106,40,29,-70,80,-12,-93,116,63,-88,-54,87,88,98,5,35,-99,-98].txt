You will recall that three of these forms are gravitational, elastic, and chemical potential energy. Two other forms of potential energy are electrical potential energy and rest mass energy. Gravitational potential energy is based on the mass of an object and the distance of that object from a reference point. Gravitational potential energy is meaningful only in that it represents a capacity to change in position _ there is no inherent potential energy in an object. What this means is that you can choose the point of reference to be whatever you want, since a constant offset will vanish when the two potential energies are subtracted to get the difference. Common reference points are the center of the Earth, the surface of the Earth, and infinity. Elastic potential energy can be determined from Hooke_s Law, because it is based on the difference between the length of the elastic material being measured and its natural length. Chemical potential energy is energy stored when chemical bonds are formed and released when they are broken again. Since it is the principle behind fossil fuels, chemical potential energy provides much of the energy used by modern society. Since chemical potential energy is based on mass, it is similar to gravitational potential energy, but different in that it uses temperature difference rather than height difference and the specific heat of the material rather than a general gravitational constant. Electrical potential energy is similar to gravitational potential energy, but is based on charge and electrical constants rather than the masses of objects and Newton's gravitational constant. The electrical potential energy per unit charge in a system is the electric potential, or voltage. As is the case with gravitational potential energy, it is the difference between two states that matters, so the most convenient reference point may be chosen for any given situation. The form of potential energy known as rest mass energy is based on relativity and states that matter is basically an extremely dense form of energy. This energy is released in nuclear reactions and, in very small quantities in laboratory experiments, antimatter reactions. The energy released is based on the change in the mass of the system and the square of the speed of light. The speed of light is a large number, so the square of the speed of light is very large. This means that a small amount of mass can be converted to a large amount of energy.",0.7827954292297363],["When we refer to electrical energy being converted to light, we use the term energy transformation.",0.7761467695236206],["What you'll be doing is using energy converted from some other form into the electrical energy you need.",0.7736236453056335],["(1) No person shall use or supply electrical energy to any electrical installation on which electrical work was or is being performed under a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 17-4.1, before the building official has completed all inspections, provided, that the building official may authorize the use of, and the supply of electrical energy to, such installation before completion of such inspections when the use of, and the supply of electrical energy to, such installation will not endanger life or property and there is good cause for making such exception.",0.7650271058082581],["What happened was that Gray had used a totally different form of electrical current - a \"cold\" form of energy.",0.7476762533187866]]
