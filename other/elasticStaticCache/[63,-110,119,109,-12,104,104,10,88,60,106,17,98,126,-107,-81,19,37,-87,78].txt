Carbofuran is one chemical that is detrimental to Burrowing Owls and is now illegal to use in most countries primary food source is insects (mostly grasshoppers), owls ingest grasshoppers that have been treated with insecticides biomagnification of pesticides (increasing concentrations up the food chain) affects reproduction in the owls Rules of Conservation in Different Regions migration routes are often through Central and South American countries, where there are fewer regulations regarding pesticide use and continued use of harmful pesticides Population Status: in 1995, the Burrowing Owl status was upgraded from Threatened to Endangered Management and Outlook: as a result of its Endangered Species status in 1995, it has the focus of a variety of conservation efforts Operation Burrowing Owl and other projects involving habitat preservation with landowners have been created populations monitored by Fish and Wildlife departments reintroduced into the British Columbia interior, where it was extirpated outlook would improve if larger areas of habitat were preserved and harmful pesticides were banned in all areas of their range numbers could increase if an increased tolerance to burrowing mammals develops (i.e. badgers) provides homes for the Burrowing Owl Outlook: perilous Public Attitudes: in North America, in the past decades, the Burrowing Owl was often killed because it was associated with Prairie-Dogs or Ground Squirrels many were shot by accident because they were mistaken for Ground Squirrels many landowners are now willing to set aside some land

1987 also reported: decline in a number of grassland species, including ground nesting waterfowl, bobwhite, ground nesting passerines Possible causes of decline: Destruction of winter habitat: tropical deforestation primarily a problem for winter habitat specialists (most are generalists) example: Townsend's Warbler, in west, one of few species that is a winter habitat specialist, may be showing more decline than winter habitat generalists Fragmentation of breeding habitat Inference from studies of breeding habitat example: black-throated blue warblers: correlation between young produced one year and breeding adults next year suggests breeding, not wintering effects determine population size Comparison of large vs. small areas of breeding habitat shows small areas have: increased competition from other bird species increases in numbers of nest predators in fragmented habitat increases in numbers of brood parasites in fragmented habitat among foliage-gleaning insectivores, birds with high risk of nest predation or parasitism because of nest location/ structure show strongest decline Other human activities that may increase predator populations decline in large predators (ex wolves) that are not nest predators may allow increase in smaller predators (ex.",0.7987781167030334],["Through retracing the steps of victims, Victoria's Human Services Department has found the aquarium to be the most likely source, but test results on water samples from its cooling towers are yet to confirm that.",0.7981838583946228],["Illegal trade in birds does still occur and this involves the capture and removal of a bird from its natural habitat, as well as the robbing of eggs and chicks from nests.",0.7969026565551758],["Migratory Birds Convention Act Environment Canada Migratory birds through prevention of destruction of nests and habitat, and regulating hunting.",0.7966161370277405],["Consider the following examples: (1) The bird builds a nest.",0.7962669730186462],["The bird feeds mostly on seeds and fruit in its native habitat, and feral populations have adapted to take in blossoms and nectar.",0.7948269248008728],["Most birds of prey build platform nests.",0.7927917242050171]]
