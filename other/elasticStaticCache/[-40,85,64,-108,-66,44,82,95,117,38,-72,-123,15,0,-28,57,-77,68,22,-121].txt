theory of inheritance explains the inheritance of dichotomous traits The modern synthesis explains how the two are really special cases of the same model The key idea: while dichotomous traits are controlled by just one pair of alleles at a single locus... continuously varying traits are controlled by many pairs of alleles at many different loci, with each locus partially influencing the trait The clearest way to illustrate this requires us to review how alleles interact alleles may be dominant vs. recessive, as in the cases we have focussed on so far in this case, there are three genotypes, but only two phenotypes the dominant one is always fully expressed, if present alleles may also be codominant with codominant alleles, the three genotypes produce three distinct phenotypes the heterozygous genotype usually produces an intermediate phenotype like the flowers with alleles for red color and white color: RR produces a red flower - only the red pigment is present, and lots of it WW produces a white flower - only the white pigment is present, and lots of it RW produces a pink flower - it has some red pigment and some white pigment this is actually a common situation, but since traits with straight dominance have only two forms and are simpler to study, Mendel chose to focus on those and so did we but the logic, Punnett squares, probabilities, etc. all work exactly the same way Now let's consider how Mendelian genetics can explain continuous variation Imagine that beak depth is controlled by one locus with codominant alleles the alleles control the amount of a beak-stimulating hormone H+ (more hormone), contributes to deeper beaks H- (less hormone), contributes to shallower beaks so the genotypes are H+H+ (deep beak) H+ \nH- (intermediate beak) H-H- (shallow beak) This only gives three kinds of beaks, not a continuous distribution it works just like any other Mendelian trait but now, imagine that another allele also affects beak depth by controlling the amount of calcium available for beak formation C+ leads to deeper beaks C- leads to smaller beaks so now the genotypes are H+H+C+C+: biggest beak H+H+C+C-: slightly smaller H+H+C-C-: slightly smaller yet H+H-C+C+: smaller than the biggest, probably not exactly the same as either of the other two, either since the effect of slightly less calcium is probably not quite the same as the effect of slightly less of the hormone H-H-C+C+: smaller than above, probably not exactly the same as the others etc. a relatively small number of alleles quickly gives a large number of combinations, with different cumulative effects in theory, there should be a large number of different beak sizes, but still with a distinctly different size for each combination of alleles however, each genotype does not always produce exactly the same size of beak there will be a range of phenotypes (beak sizes) for each genotype, since the beak size is also affected somewhat by the bird's environment its diet, temperature, etc. so each genotype actually produces a range of beak sizes while the differences between the average size for each genotype are small so this variation fills in the gaps between the beak sizes produced by different genotypes the effect is what looks like continuous variation in the phenotype even though the underlying genotypes are still distinct combinations of alleles Cool result: this means that matings will produce offspring that usually look \"blended\", but sometimes exceed the parents on certain traits: just like what we really observe both parents will generally have a mix of alleles that affect a given trait, like height each will have some alleles that promote taller stature, and others that promote shorter stature the offspring each get a random selection of these alleles from each parent usually, the offspring will get some alleles for tallness, some for shortness, and will come out with a moderate height in fact, since each offspring combines a random sample of the father's alleles and a random sample of the mother's alleles, most offspring will tend to have a mix of alleles that is somewhere intermediate between the parents this looks like blending inheritance but occasionally, just by the luck of the draw, an offspring will happen to get mostly alleles for tallness, or mostly alleles for shortness if an offspring got, say, almost all the father's \"tallness\" alleles and few of his \"shortness\" alleles, and almost all the mother's \"tallness\" alleles and few of her \"shortness\" alleles, the offspring could have a higher percentage of \"tallness\" alleles than either parent this could produce individuals who have traits that exceed those of their parents just as we occasionally see in real offspring this is how Mendelian genetics produces offspring that usually look like blends of most of their parents' traits but sometimes have traits that are not intermediate between their parents This is an important way in which \"new\" variants are produced for natural selection to act on they are not new alleles , but rather new combinations of alleles they may not even really be new combinations, just combinations that are so unlikely by chance that they don't happen very often of course, there is no guarantee that the next generation of offspring will get the same combination in fact, it is very unlikely but if the combination leads to that individual having more offspring, the alleles of the combination will become more common and the more common the alleles become, the more often this combination will
