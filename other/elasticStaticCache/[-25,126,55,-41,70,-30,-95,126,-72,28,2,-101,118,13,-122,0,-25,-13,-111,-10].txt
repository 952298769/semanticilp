[["Each summer, after the 4 to 5 month mating season has ended, male mallard will molt their feathers, and they will be left with a brown plumage like their female counterparts. In the fall, male mallards will undergo a second molt, after which their distinct coloration will return. The outer feathers of ducks are waterproof. Ducks have a special oil producing gland near their tail that spreads and covers their outer coat of feathers. Beneath their waterproof layer of feathers, ducks have a layer of fluffy and soft feathers called down which keep them warm in cold temperatures.",2.4643044471740723],["mate with DUCKS.                       DUCKS mates with DUCKS",2.12060546875],["DUCKS mates with DUCKS",1.9253484010696411],["Duck hunters in Nova Scotia, Carter said, even have a special breed of dog to help attract ducks.",1.8854159116744995],["Mating Ducks",1.82832932472229],["Mating Ducks",1.82832932472229],["mate with DUCKS.",1.82832932472229],["After a splash in the pond they all gather around and preen their feathers to remove parasites, keeping them clean and ensuring they are water-repellent.
