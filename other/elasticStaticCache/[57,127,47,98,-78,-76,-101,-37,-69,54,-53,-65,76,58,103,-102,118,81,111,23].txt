characteristics, recognize arms, legs, head, eyes, ears, etc., make observations about things found in nature, clouds, animals, plants, etc., compare size, shape, and structure of living things) K.2 define science as a search for answers about themselves and their world (e.g., recognize the roles of people involved in science careers) K.3 explore objects and events (e.g., make qualitative observations using the five senses, identify changes in nature) K.4 probe deeply into natural phenomena by asking and answering questions about the environment (e.g., animals, plants, stars, weather) K.5 use a variety of communication techniques (e.g., pictures, models, graphs) K.6 realize that science is never finished by observing changes in the environment (e.g., weather cycles, plant and animal cycles) K.7 recognize that a solution to one scientific problem often creates new problems (e.g., recycling) Scientific Attitudes/Habits of Mind K.8 ask and answer questions to further an appreciation and joy of discovery of the natural world K.9 demonstrate innate curiosity, initiative, and creativity by asking questions about the environment (e.g., day/night, weather conditions, living things) K.10 be in awe and wonder of the patterns, variations, and interactions of natural objects in the environment (e.g., tree, leaves, animal structures, sun and shadow) K.11 trust observations and accept results of personal discoveries (e.g., use five senses) K.12 listen to and be tolerant of different viewpoints (e.g., working in groups, communicate what is perceived) K.13 continue probing phenomena until questions are resolved (e.g., properties of living and non-living things, effects of weather) K.14 regard science as an integrated whole and a part of daily life K.15 recognize that scientists work alone and in groups (e.g., visit scientists at work, work in groups to make simple models) Scientific Processes/Thinking Skills K.16 develop observational skills (e.g., use of senses) K.17 collect and record information in a variety of ways (e.g., drawings, weather calendar, graphs) K.18 use a variety of classification systems (e.g., sorting by color, shape, size, texture) K.19 make predictions based on personal observations (e.g., clouds-rain, cold weather-snow, bud-flowers, metamorphosis of butterflies) K.20 use mathematical skills in investigations (e.g.,
