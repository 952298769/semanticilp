and CaCO3 + H+ + HCO3- = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- - important action in limestone terrain where solution features lead to Karst Topography - responsible for hard water (Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) - some rocks can be completely dissolved and leached away, few outcrops exist except in deserts 22 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION -

rock material passes directly into solution by dissociation of the constituent ions in a liquid e.g. salt dissolving in water &#9;&#9;NaCl = Na + + Cl - ** most minerals are slowly soluble in pure water, the presence of small amounts of acids increases solubility by providing excess hydrogen ion (H+) 21 Page 22 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) SOLUTION (Carbonation) Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks e.g.",1.0313133001327515],["A chemical reaction caused by exposure to oxygen that results in a change in the chemical composition of a mineral.",1.0264642238616943],["A chemical reaction caused by exposure to oxygen that results in a change in the chemical composition of a mineral.",1.0264642238616943],["Major changes are occurring in the chemical composition of our atmosphere.",1.024583339691162],["Major changes are occurring in the chemical composition of our atmosphere.",1.024583339691162],["Chemical weathering: This also involves several processes, all of which result in smaller pieces of material which are compositionally different from the original.",1.021350622177124],["mechanical weathering speeds up chemical weathering by breaking the rocks and minerals into smaller pieces, thus increasing the mineral's surface areas and allowing them to enter into chemical reactions more easily 7.",1.0202198028564453],["The second classification, chemical weathering, involves the direct effect of atmospheric chemicals or biologically produced chemicals also known as biological weathering in the breakdown of rocks, soils and minerals.",1.0182578563690186],["The second classification, chemical weathering, involves the direct effect of atmospheric chemicals or biologically produced chemicals also known as biological weathering in the breakdown of rocks, soils and minerals.",1.0182578563690186],["Customized control of properties without change in chemical composition.",1.0171281099319458],["This water helps the chemical breakdown of rocks.",1.0140537023544312],["A breakdown of one mass into two or more masses, with no chemical change in the mineral or rock.",1.0117621421813965],["A breakdown of one mass into two or more masses, with no chemical \nchange in the mineral or rock.",1.0117621421813965],["and how the lack of chemicals can cause alcoholism and mental breakdowns, or even blindness for example.",1.0106704235076904],["A.

indicates that liquid water may have existed on the planet's surface Detrital (also known as clastic) sedimentary rocks consist of pieces of pre-existing rocks for example sandstone Chemical Sedimentary Rocks consist of chemicals from pre-existing rocks for example rock salt Processes involved in making Sedimentary Rocks Weathering Mechanical = smaller pieces produced Chemical = new

promotes movement of chemicals and can participate in chemical reactions chemical weathering is accelerated in warm, moist conditions Table 5.1 p. 99 High temperature minerals in Bowen's reaction

ripple marks, mud cracks, gutter casts), fossils Submarine Fans as an example Fig 5.28 sediment carried far out to sea by turbidity currents graded bedding is sedimentary structure Lithification turns loose sediment such as sand grains into rock such as sandstone compaction (particles brought together by weight of overlying sediment) cementation (particles glued together by chemically precipitated minerals including quartz, calcite and hematite) Classification see Table 5.3 p 108 Detrital rocks names based on particle size for example, rocks made of sand-sized particles are called sandstones chemical sedimentary rocks named for the dominate mineral that they contain for example, rocks made up of the mineral calcite are called limestones limestones are the most common chemical sedimentary rocks, most contain calcite skeletons of organisms such as coral Sedimentary Rocks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) ( Toronto Rocks p 3-4, 10-11) Layer II is the bedrock which consists of limestones interlayered with shales the fossils found in these rocks show that their depositional environment was a warm, shallow sea Layer III consists of geologically young Quaternary sediments deposited by glaciers or in glacially-influenced lakes these sediments have not been cemented into rocks The Niagara Escarpment forms a ridge along the western boundary of the GTA It reveals bedrock (the solid rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water that is driven off when clay minerals are heated Types of Metamorphism Fig 6.19, p. 139 regional occurs when rocks are deformed by combinations of high temperatures and/or high pressures especially important at convergent plate margins Fig 6.5, p. 130 contact occurs when magma alters the rock it intrudes Fig 6.7, p. 131 dynamic occurs when rock ground up with movement along a fault Shock

foliated Foliation a parallel arrangement of elongated minerals for example platy minerals such as micas Fig 6.9, p.134 produced when minerals become oriented due to differential pressure Foliated Metamorphic Rocks named on the basis of the size of the minerals grains and their shape or granularity slate consists of microscopic mineral grains its foliation causes it to split into flat layers that can be used for billiard and pool table tops Fig 6.10, p. 134 gneiss (pronounced \"nice\") consists mainly of granular minerals its foliation is seen in alternating bands of of felsic (light) and mafic (dark) minerals Fig 6.12, p.135 Nonfoliated Metamorphic Rocks contain granular rather than platy minerals that have increased in size through recrystallization Fig 6.15, p. 137 and 6.14, p. 136
