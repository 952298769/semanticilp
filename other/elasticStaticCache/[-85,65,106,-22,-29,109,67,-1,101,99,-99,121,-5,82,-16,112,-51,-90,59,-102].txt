photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water are combined, using energy from sunlight, to form glucose Oxygen is given off as a waste product This is the source of the oxygen in the atmosphere Photosynthesis has 2 sets of reactions: Light reactions split water Hydrogens are used to produce a reduced coenzyme, NADPH, and ATP Oxygen is given off Once the NADPH and ATP are formed the rest of the reactions can take place in the dark CO2 is reduced to glucose A set of cyclic reactions: the Calvin cycle Blue Light Has More Energy than Red Light Light energy has both a wave nature (like the
