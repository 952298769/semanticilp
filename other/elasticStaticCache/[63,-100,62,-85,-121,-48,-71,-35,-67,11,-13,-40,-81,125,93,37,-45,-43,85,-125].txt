the changing composition of the atmosphere, such as ozone, water vapour, greenhouse gases, and pollutants Atmospheric Science (Pressure and Winds) It is expected that students will: outline the complex wind circulation patterns over the earth describe the local conditions that determine the patterns of local and seasonal winds describe wind deflection due to the Coriolis effect describe effects of wind on human activities Atmospheric Science (Evaporation, Precipitation, and Weather) It is expected that \nstudents will: demonstrate or illustrate the hydrologic cycle, including how temperature and pressure are related to phase changes of water in the atmosphere and relative humidity name and identify the three basic types of clouds: cumulus, stratus, and cirrus identify and describe the forms of precipitation: rain, hail, snow, sleet, and dew distinguish the characteristics of the main kinds of air masses and the resulting weather patterns demonstrate or describe the formation of fronts between air masses and the weather associated with them measure, record, and identify a variety of atmospheric data and use them to predict weather conditions describe the origins and uses of weather forecasts and weather maps Earth's History (Geologic Time) It is expected that students will: distinguish between weathering and erosion distinguish between relative and absolute time apply principles of relative age dating to the interpretation of geologic sequences correlate rock units from one area to another outline the process of absolute dating by means of radioactive elements use the principles of radiometric dating to solve simple problems related to absolute time determine age by direct observation, such as counting growth rings and varves explain the process of fossil formation describe how fossils are the key to the interpretation of past events use the geologic time scale to compare the ages and lengths of various segments of geologic time describe the
