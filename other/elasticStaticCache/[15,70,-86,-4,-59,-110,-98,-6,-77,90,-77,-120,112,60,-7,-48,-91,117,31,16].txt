gallons Provides a fermentation vat for bacteria and protozoa to process cellulose Allows cows to regurgitate and rechew their food (cud) Re-chewed food swallowed, goes into reticulum, omasum and abomasum Abomasum released gastric juices Is equivalent to human stomach Leads to a very efficient digestion of cellulose Horses, rodents and lagomorphs retain bacteria in the caecum Cannot

C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Happy Meals The holiday meals were special too with many good things that I knew were just for that wonderful day when I would hear my Grandma say \"Eat it all and do not waste this food we share of special taste that we won't enjoy for another year\" that was such a long time I did fear The everyday meals that we all shared by Mom and Grandma they were prepared the time to eat was always the same the time when to the table we all came At supper time in the fall of the year I could see reflections almost clear in the large windows covered with steam that made this setting look like a dream That place of shelter from the outside cold in that ten room house so big, so bold the many meals we shared with pleasure the memories of these is a true treasure &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gathering By The Hearth The fire place that glowed with heat when you sat up close it warmed your feet it was only lit for special reasons such as the wonderful holiday seasons On Thanksgiving night or Christmas day I would hear my Father say \"go down to the cellar and bring some wood so we may build a fire warm and good\" The fire would flicker then it would rise to become so grand right before our eyes it lit up the room and our spellbound faces casting our shadows in the corners and spaces of that very large room where we congregated while all who gathered patiently waited for the final treat of the holiday season as you will see, we had very good reason When the fire burned down to coals we would make pop corn, many bowls but the treat I loved as a little fellow was to roast on a stick my own marshmallow until it was toasted golden brown a better treat could not be found I would eat three or four my Mom would say \"enough, no more\" Then I was off to my very own bed while visions of marshmallows danced in my head to lay there happy as a boy could be waiting for the next train you see to come from the east or the west this time of night was always the best the sound of the whistle drawing near left me at peace as I did hear the steam engine so big, so strong that lulled me to sleep before long to dream of what tomorrow held for me in dreams that were only mine to see &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Rainy Day Place On the many days when the weather was bad I was blessed with a treasure few have had a great chasm beneath my home where I could run, play and roam The cellar was exciting in many ways I had much fun there, I must say enjoying the games that my dog and I would play on a snow blown night or a rainy day I can not remember all of them from the days I was less than ten I do remember quite a few listen closely now, as I share them with you My friends and I played hide and seek from our hiding places we would peek so quiet, so still we all would sit until we were found by the one who was it Haunted house we would play at night after turning out each and every light the hot water tank gave off a light of blue that made this place look strange and new we would sneak around in this place so dim if someone came close we jumped out at him he would yell and jump up off the floor we all would laugh and play some more &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My Favorite Toy An electric train, the best toy I had was mounted on wood by me and my Dad where we built the country and a town the little train went round and round we added a bridge and a tunnel too when this tunnel the train did pass through I would look into the other end at night to watch for the engine's little bright light the engine smoked, the whistle blew it had a headlight like real trains do it huffed and puffed up hill very slow then down the other side to town it would go There was a train station in the town where I would slow the train way down then I would stop it for a short time while make believe people aboard did climb I would give the whistle a toot, toot, toot it sounded like a very small flute I'd start the train on it's way down the track it traveled many miles, but it always came back &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pirate Treasure There was an old chest filled with many things we pretended they were gold, jewels and rings to us, my young friends and me a pirates treasure we did see we played pirates with swords made of wood hats made of cloth and paper were good protecting the treasure was our game after giving ourselves very funny names like Peg Leg Pete and One Eyed Joe Jolly Jake and Little Moe we would pretend to have \na big sword fight that lasted the day and into the night Then we would sit down on the cellar stairs a very good treat from my Mom we would share we would talk about the game we had just played we would plan to do it again, another day It seems to me only right that all children behold the sight of a chasm beneath the place where they live to enjoy the fun-filled hours it gives &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Root Cellar In the cellar beneath the house where I did reside over in the corner on the other side there was a place I truly loved to go it held many good things to eat, I want you to know it was a small room in the corner down there filled with many good things to eat and to share it was the root cellar with its dirt floor so neat filled with jars of my Mom's special home-made treats Vegetables and fruits in the fall we did pick Mom cooked them in our kitchen so very quick she placed then in glass jars while they were still hot by the time winter arrived, we had a lot there were many shelves on which you could find sauces and pickles of every kind jars of jams and jellies, row after row and lots of vegetables that made me grow When the wind did howl and the snow did blow down to the cellar I would go and bring up to Mom for our evening feast the best food ever, to say the least the fruits we had picked were a real prize Mom used them to bake tarts and pies when dinner was done and the table was cleared she would bring in the pie as we all cheered On your special day she would bake a cake for you she served it with candles and ice cream too real whipped cream she would pile on top I would eat so much, I just had to stop &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~10~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Missing Boy I remember when I was but four I went out through the open door to walk the distance to the store where Mom and I had gone before I knew the way past seven streets to the place where Mom got all those treats so I ventured out on my own I was four years old, thought I was grown I entered that store through the open door I remember the sound of that old wooden floor I helped myself to a pack of gum I had come here to enjoy, to have some fun I left the store through that same door I settled down on the front porch floor I stuffed in five sticks of that red gum always before, I was allowed only one I settled back to enjoy this treat when my Mother's stare my eyes did meet she jerked me up by my hand she marched me in to see the man She made me spit out that treat so good in front of the man I now stood after saying \"I'm sorry, won't do it again\" she marched me the seven streets and then she made me a harness of some old rope she scolded me and expressed the hope that I would learn from what she had done that I would remember, I was her only son she explained to me something I didn't know that all who searched thought to the lake I did go all our good neighbors searched here and there they could not find me anywhere For two long weeks when outside I could not run far enough to hide for to Mom's cloths line I stayed tied even though I yelled and cried From this I learned lessons true your parents really do love you that stealing from others is very wrong and fighting temptation makes you strong &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B.

Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Day At Play To sleep through the night hours seven or eight then to the sounds of morning awake to rush down the stairs, by two I leapt for there was no heat in the room where I slept to perch on a register warmed by a fire of coal to settle down with a very large bowl of hot oats covered with cream and sugar so brown a better start to the day could never be found When I was dressed and ready to play I would start out on this brand new day a new adventure I would find with my trusty dog, this pal of mine be he a lion, a horse or a bear my trusty dog was always there to fill my day in a special way he was my best friend, I must say my dog and I played fetch in the yard he was so fast, he worked so hard he protected me with a sharp eye watching closely when strangers walked by Why he loved a bath, heaven only knows he would bark and beg when I got the hose he would run round and round very fast while I sprayed him until he was soaked at last I would wash him with a bar of soap to remove all his fleas was my hope I would dry him with some old rag he'd smile at me as his tail did wag then he would shake from tail to nose and if you were the one he chose right next to you he would come and sit as \nif to ask \"that's all, that's it?\"",0.8080651760101318],["X1011586443-00045-12112</DOCNO> Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Artist Elton John Album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Year 1975 Credits Comments music by Elton John words by Bernie Taupin Tracks Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding Candle In The Wind Bennie And The Jets Goodbye Yellow Brick Road This Song Has No Title Grey Seal Jamaica Jerk Off I've Seen That Movie Too Sweet Painted Lady The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) Dirty Little Girl All The Girls Love Alice Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll) Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting Roy Rogers Social Disease Harmony Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding The roses in the window box Have tilted to one side Everything about this house Was born to grow and die Oh it doesn't seem a year ago To this very day You said I'm sorry honey If I don't change the pace I can't face another day And love lies bleeding in my hand Oh it kills me to think of you with another man I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan But my guitar couldn't hold you So I split the band Love lies bleeding in my hands I wonder if those changes Have left a scar on you Like all the burning hoops of fire That you and I passed through You're a bluebird on a telegraph line I hope you're happy now Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl You'll make it back somehow Candle In The Wind Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your \nbrain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would have liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude Goodbye Norma Jean From the young man in the 22nd row Who sees you as something as more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe Bennie And The Jets Hey kids, shake it loose together The spotlight's hitting something That's been known to change the weather We'll kill the fatted calf tonight So stick around You're gonna hear electric music Solid walls of sound Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful Oh Bennie she's really keen She's got electric boots a mohair suit You know I read it in a magazine Bennie and the Jets Hey kids, plug into the faithless Maybe they're blinded But Bennie makes them ageless We shall survive, let us take ourselves along Where we fight our parents out in the streets To find who's right and who's wrong Goodbye Yellow Brick Road When are you gonna come down When are you going to land I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods Hunting the horny back toad Oh I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do then I bet that'll shoot down your plane It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics To set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacement There's plenty like me to be found Mongrels who ain't got a penny Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground This Song Has No Title Tune me in to the wild side of life I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife Take me to the garretts where the artists have died Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines Look in the mirror and stare at myself And wonder if that's really me on the shelf And each day I learn just a little bit more I don't know why but I do know what for If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune Take me down alleys where the murders are done In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun Want to read books in the studies of men Born on the breeze and die on the wind If I was an artist who paints with his eyes I'd study my subject and silently cry Cry for my darkness to come down on me For confusion to carry on turning the wheel Grey Seal Why's it never light on my lawn Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born On the big screen they showed us the sun But not as bright in life as the real one It's never quite the same as the real one And tell me grey seal How does it feel To be so wise To see through eyes That only see what's real Tell me grey seal I never learned why meteors were formed I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn If anyone can cry then so can I I read books and draw life from the eye All my life is drawings from the eye Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men The roots were formed by twisted roots Your roots were twisted then I was re-born before all life could die The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I Jamaica Jerk Off When she gets up in the morning It's enough to wake the dead Oh she turning on the radio And dancing on my head It's no good living in the sun Playing guitar all day Boogalooing with my friends In that erotic way Come on Jamaica In Jamaica all day Dancing with your darling Do Jamaica jerk-off that way Come on Jamaica Everybody say We're all happy in Jamaica Do Jamaica Jerk-off that way Let the ladies and the gentlemen Be as rude as they like On the beaches, oh in the jungle Where the people feel alright So do it Jamaica Got plenty for you and me Honky tonking with my baby In that deep blue sea I've Seen That Movie Too I can see by your eyes you must be lying When you think I don't have a clue Baby you're crazy If you think that you can fool me Because I've seen that movie too The one where the players are acting surprised Saying love' \ns just a four letter word Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes Well their actions become so absurd So keep your auditions for somebody Who hasn't got so much to lose 'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting That I've seen that movie too It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around Stop twinkling your star like you do I'm not the blue print for all of your B films Because I've seen that movie too Sweet Painted Lady I'm back on dry land once again Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain We're all hunting honey with money to burn Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned If the boys all behave themselves here Well there's pretty young ladied and beer in the rear You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright So she lays down beside me again My sweet painted lady, the one with no name Many have used her and many still do There's a place in the world for a woman like you Oh sweet painted lady Seems it's always been the same Getting paid for being laid Guess that's the name of the game Forget us we'll have gone very soon Just forget we ever slept in your rooms And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds Where love's just a job and nothing is said The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) Some punk with a shotgun Killed young Danny Bailey In cold blood, in the lobby Of a downtown motel Killed him in anger A force he couldn't handle Helped pull the trigger That cut short his life And there's not many knew him The way that we did Sure enough he was a wild one But then aren't most hungry kids Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in Dillinger's dead I guess the cops won again Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in We're running short of heroes Back up here in the hills Without Danny Bailey We're gonna have to break up our stills So mark his grave well 'Cause Kentucky loved him Born and raised a proper I guess life just bugged him And he found faith in danger A lifestyle he lived by A running gun younster In a sad restless age Dirty Little Girl I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard When I watch the police come by and move you on Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl Someone grab that bitch by the ears Rub her down scrub her back And turn her inside out 'Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped All The Girls Love Alice Raised to be a lady by the golden rule Alice was the spawn of a public school With a double barrel name in the back of her brain And a simple case of Mummy doesn't love me\" blues Reality it seems was just a dream She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen And hey, hey, hey, you know what I mean All the young girls love Alice Tender young Alice they say Come over and see me Come over and please me Alice it's my turn today All the young girls love Alice Tender young Alice they say If I give you my number Will you promise to call me Wait till my husband's away Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part Getting your kicks in another girl's bed And it was only last Tuesday oh they found you in the subway dead And who could you call your friends down in Soho One or two middle aged dykes in a Go-Go And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo And hey, hey, hey, oh don't you know Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll) I could really get off being in your shoes I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues A heard of a place at the back of town Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down I really got buzzed when your sister said Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired Oh your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll Out bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do She's only sixteen but it's plain to see She can pull the wool over little old me Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll Your sister can't \ntwist but she got more soul than me Somebody help me 'cause the bug bit me Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet But I'll be back tonight where the music plays And your sister rocks all my blues away I really got buzzed when your sister said Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting It's getting late have you seen my mates Ma tell me when the boys get here It's seven o'clock and I want to rock Want to get a belly full of beer My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys And my old lady she don't care My sister looks cute in her braces and boots A handfull of grease in her hair Don't give us none of your aggravation We had it with your discipline Saturday night's alright for fighting Get a little action in Get about as oiled as a diesel train Gonna set this dance alight 'Cause Saturday night's the night I like Saturday night's alright alright alright Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right I may use a little muscle to get what I need I may sink a little drink and shout

she The devil and I just she and me We talk of this ... we talk of that Yet always laughter breaks our chat We hate each other I and she With a love enduring as none can see 1965 Birth Cursed were sons of yet unborn Cursed were faces still unknown Fiery fountains grief and pain Howling muse is come again Seeing doom around around Seeing masks in sulphur gowned Incestuous combinations sue And crawl from womb in bloody gore Chew the cord and loose the host Of image making whore 1967 Animal Farm Scuttling herds of arrogant cows Parade their wares around the town Cat's skin stinking with rabbity fur But a pat on the arse don't produce no purr Unfeeling eyes of a python's mould Curb the bit on stud stallion's hold Long thin thighs of whippet fame Offer brief chills of the thrashing game 'Our hardened hearts bleakly pursuing A secret place where none can share Face upon face so sour reflecting A naked wish to be elsewhere Unyielded love chews soul destroying That open smile from yesteryear' 1967 Portrait Sudden vision of green and pink little fox tongue chewing on serpent lip Mottled teeth of sharpness acrid pointed each to a cramped mouth Eyes all ginger brown beguiling soft and warm when nature trusted Curved and deviled lashes glinting barely shielding a candle's glow Head all fuzzy bristling sternly unsuppressed by lotion's glue Eyes and chin and nose transparent shimmer shake and curl all through Lips so tight they can give nothing saving hard for years before Bottom bouncing legs a'flashing legs a'swinging to and fro Cheeks all curved and dimpled open nests of fur and sweat bejewelled Softly giving never taking scarce for fear of hurting more Vanished long and long forgotten 'cept in dreams of yestermorn Loved young leaves youthful ever pray senile ashes drag a glow 1967 Poem 1 wattled wippen wylin women claw at sheltered souls to chew and spit the broken meat full fleshed used out the bloody bone Poem 2 Words of electric flicker so rare follow dream so barren cannot care Emptied sombre sound thrilled with moment's flair mourns unyielding the silence of not there 1967 Chances Chances lost and chances taken Castles strong and walls unbroken Strength without of utmost bonds Holding softness weakness chained Freeing none to none unfreeing Holding all to all beholding Breaking each and every one Amongst their dreams 1967 Vision Homecomings heartcomings Long winter night's roamings White snow squelching on the great paved step Bird tracks flecking the dog toed ground Yellow light seeps from our window Where a shaggy black nose squirms Howls for just one chance to place those soft saucers ( in marvellous white snow ) and even chew a rabbit And over all the gentle moon gazing down crispen true through familiar branches climbed each one and dappled now by white snow And the white snow squelching down the path as we set off for the town 1967 Barb I met Shelley this night And he smiled on me For my dream is of right The way life should be The soul floats on love And leaps high to the air Shield it not with a glove In flight soars its flair Joy must take its chance On the barb of the heart Youth is gone in one glance So let hurt play its part When song no more gives Caliban has his say For in truth love lives It's the poets who decay mostly for Browning 1967 Sonnet The heart stirs as a spaniel at stone Leaps a whoops head high in the air That meeting of eye casts a flicker unknown Revealing still thought yet so pure Black bundle of paws bowling all free Charge clean from lusting through nowhere Home smiles clad with a welcoming rag Must unearth some stain somewhere Unease beneath but a bubble on top Untouched unopen unsure For what's beneath should never be taught No pretence but it's always there Living the dream don't look to the side High head intent chasing flare Quickening glance sharp snap try a bite Don't awaken innocence beware 'Let the days come as months And the months come as years For the exposing of depth Marks the roots red with tears' 1967 Monologue Pursuing these plastic statues That writhe and twist in your rhythm Colouring their hair red and their garments green For a devotion My words a solid mask of dullness The spirit fallen The heart broken You you are my life When I know what you are Time stops I live And the heart is so good I do not hold your hand I do not touch you We sit in chairs My legs pointing Yours reticent folded So happy we search each other's eyes And smile and laugh and love Each other I do not touch You do not touch But we dance between our bodies As the laughter takes us And the words flow giving In some dream even taking And the wet brown mist Touches me And we laugh to hide the beautiful pain For our souls skip in the air before us Fragile tender raw Screaming as they \ntouch each other Gay we sit as our silver tongues Caress and cut our secret parts We would give each other everything If we could So instead we give nothing But ripples in the air I dream of holding you loving And your arms unclenched And your head on my shoulder As we hug and squeeze in joy At being together When a part of yourself Lives very far away The little left amuses In drawing happy moments And seeking An eye here a bottom there Help to smooth But never your thrill to the heart Only a shadow's proxy As a moment knows you In some stray face With them At night in the dark I just pretend they're you Then it's alright 1967 Verse The words that race from lips So fast they can't be caught The depths suddenly plumbed When rhythm's lost in thought The knowing all and being all Of vine leaves worn by right Wake the everyday futility Of penetrating night The searching for that reason Through the pursuit of the heart Before innocence is overthrown As the goddess plays a part The oneness of our love When myself returns my sight That experience so exquisite Immortality's bite The chasing down the years Catch the magical in print Before the age old suffering Makes memory extinct Bodies loved must minds unlove Can kisses not unite The meeting of us lovers Cast in virgin light The unknowing of what they do to you The unfeeling of all that hurt Humanity is a stranger race Communication inert Soft dance thru the midst of them Side stepping from their fight Intent on the life's pursuit A dream born by right 1967 Woodlands The lack of a song in the soul Is the cause of a celibate curse The loss of spring in the vine Taints the rhythm of verse The freshness the thrill of before Is repeated as memory plays The records the hope of young heart Relayed thru some innocent face But the fire in the heart is all still The wine to the head no more What was there by right in the past Is dredged from the depths as a chore The pen so easy skips its beat But whereof is its reason Are all singers doomed to play mechanic When love moves on in season Drinking pubs dry is an art my friend To which I have given much attention But when the old body says no more Must seek out a new direction Face the world stick out your chin Go out and sniff at the sun And as for life that wondrous thing Pretend it's just begun Love and women and sex are no good They only cause you pain So be a boy just ten years old And summer come again You and I we played by a stream Watching the horses trot Those were the days of bracken green Before the trees were cut The lawns were great for a croquet bash But I preferred the woods There's something magic there in the green In silence with the rooks Nettles and thistles and midges that sting The smell of a festering pool Are lost in the image of bird in tree Come to conduct his school But the horses best I remember the meet The height of black and pink A chestnut pawing at her bit A silver tankard's clink And the fox we chased along with the car Long hounds stretched in pursuit Low hedges chopping up the hunt As hunters changed their foot And then the fox was away in the wood The hounds had been too slow We weren't to get our taste of the brush Not for a year or so When life's gone foul go back to roots And find who you really are For there is no sense in living out An act for fifty year If you give love then you'll get it back That's what the fates decree And sometimes throw in as bonus The love that none can see But where is the magic to forget the past And repair the damage done Must the record ever stick its groove And the tankard drunk on the lawn for Robert Frost 29 October 1967 Review Didn't see the hate before Didn't know it was there It's a hell of a shock to see what's writ Was ever a soul so bare But what's down there is but half the truth The easier bit to rhyme The magic that dances from silver lips Is saved for a happier time That purity the saving grace Was smashed in the hammer blow God grant it was only squashed flat And the recovery's been slow You can't be bad without plenty of good Or else the mind is torn But you seem to have played for keeps And ripped the soul you adorn Can't believe it's really true That it's ugly and spiteful and trite I always believed that underneath The heart was warm still bright The horrors are weighted so high in the mind They can't be looked at straight Verses only chew at the edge The centre insane in state The neurosis is known The pattern well read But how to be surgeon Inside your own head To be told you were Pound When talking of Cecy Was a warning that sound Betrays fallacy The silver tongue was my sport in the past It took me through everything But when can I ever risk that dance And whisper words again Somewhere deep is a heart I know That promised in the sun But the hate was so deeply set at the start Nowhere left to run You carry the cancer for twenty years And try to be sweet and true But God knows the moment you turn from heights \nThe filth eats right through The only hope is to stick to the same We really should never been born We give you your moments of magic and mirth And love you in spite of the scorn Separate in ourselves We love all the world And hate it for what it has done But the art that is bad Is to break down and howl Revenging for what was torn The spirit of Shelley is there for us And the fun of sleek old Cat Thank God that Will he knew it all What Burns instincted at But the hate the hate Am I too late Do I start where others stop For I know that life is but ten years old Before the trees were cut 1967 Odyssey When I may write of her That made me that I am My rhymes need no more run Her self enough of flair I paint her picture not Scribbling another's face The reason for this waste Unknown lost but sought I knew her in a moment When our eyes met the first time A trance yet twenty yards away As met fate sprang my mind To read there's something there To sense that all's not words As the need for finding breaks The hunted with the hounds Is not the same as meeting one Was sprung by birth to stars Yet I may not write of her That taught me I was real Could the beauty be all mine A reflection of myself But that's not true 'twas there Your poetry in the night As you laughed and spoke till dawn And I worshipped at your sight I hear your voice no more Yet I seek it through my life 1967 Perennial The comfort of a well filled page With rhymes and rhythms perfected The exact word the clever phrase All earned the accolade 'Master' Another world of measured graces Where dictioned voices uttered Classic tones without complication Of thinking Freudian lovers A Great War fell down on sheltered styles And revealed much more in beauty That a gentle heart and a rustic sense Could not suffice as poetry For verse to be a preserver of language The receptacle of civilised dignity Is to ignore the blood and the fire of the times There's no purpose in obscurity Better to practice the monosyllabic Encourage the new propaganda Than measure the shock of the Peasant Revolt With words designed for Miranda 1968 Morning You in the dim morning light Laughing and staring Your hair fluffed and shoulders bare As you listened in the morning To a mind racing its patterns With no understanding Appeasing its gods Mouthing its prayers And you listened in the morning As the cool hard floor Touched at tense fingers Beckoning in the dawn And you spoke of a someone Who perhaps loved a someone But you were so young in the morning Who taught you this

maintained separately Whole set constitutes clone library of original DNA Stage 4: Screening Identify clone line containing fragment of interest Among most difficult and critical steps Preliminary Screening of Clones Eliminate bacteria not containing proper DNA fragment Use genes conferring antibiotic resistance fig 19.7a Eliminate bacteria without vehicle Culture clones on medium containing antibiotic Only bacteria resistant to antibiotic will grow on it Eliminate bacteria with vehicle, but lacking fragment Use vector with gene that enables cell to metabolize X-gal sugar Metabolism of X-gal produces blue product Cells with vector and functional gene will turn blue fig 19.7b Test clones for presence of X-gal metabolism Clones with fragment lose ability to metabolize sugar DNA

conversation His old mind, it wanders some But a better compadre ain&#146;t lived or breathed Than my ole&#146; amigo Lum Now Lum, he&#146;s plenty punchy Ya won&#146;t find a tougher old coot But down right, plain old common sense Ain&#146;t one of his stronger suits You won&#146;t find a better feller To have round ya in a pinch His head&#146;s as hard as granite rock And he won&#146;t give an inch We were cowboyin&#146; up in the Keechi hills It was one of our lighter days But we&#146;d &#145;bout had our bellies full Of cuttin&#146; those cedar stays The weekend, now was comin&#146; up Time for the big rodeo in town Been quite a spell since we&#146;d been in Lum and me would ride on down Now Lum ain&#146;t no spring chicken But he acts just like a kid When the bullriders finally mount the beasts Used to twist &#145;em himself, he did The crowd gathered &#145;round the buckin&#146; chutes They were thick as bitin&#146; fleas And Lum, his stature&#146;s lackin&#146; some Makin&#146; it tough for him to see Ole&#146; Lum sure ain&#146;t no genius But what next he did made sense He climbed up near the buckin&#146; chutes And sat upon the fence The fence sure ain&#146;t as comfy As his recliner back at the shack And the cable through the cross-tie posts Seemed to be a little slack Now ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s kinda portly Of a diet he ain&#146;t thought So the cable strand he sat upon Down the line had been drawn taught The announcer&#146;s voice boomed loudly Of the high horned brindle beast Two thousand pounds of ragin&#146; hell Was soon to be released On Widowmaker, they kicked the latch He followed the gate around Then planted his feet and sucked back left And slammed that cowboy down He gave the clown a hookin&#146; Made a lap around the pen But there ain&#146;t a fence for a hundred miles That could hold this brinlde in The Widowmaker, he sized it up Then made a fitful run He was intent on clearin&#146; that fence Just four posts down from Lum He quit the earth in one great leap Now comes the change of events A solid ton of snortin&#146; beef Hit smack on top of that \nfence Ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s cool, just sat there calm With both hands in his pockets But a ton of bull on that cable strand Shot Lum off like a rocket Now Lum survived the launchin&#146; And annihilation merely by chance But he didn&#146;t make re-entry &#145;Till halfway through the dance Lum told me it wasn&#146;t the launch Nor the fallin&#146;, nor the drop The thing that hurt his ole&#146; body so Was that mighty sudden stop Lum believes the moral here Needs tellin&#146; to all you fans It&#146;s best to watch the rodeo From somewhere in the stands 1999, Jay Snider, All rights reserved Four Little Words Four little words have stuck in my mind From the time I was just a small child &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148; is what he would say When he talked of the men he admired I remember those men he talked about Sure &#145;nuff cowboys, tough, but kind They said what they meant and meant what they said These men are getting&#146; harder to find &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he was true to his word That&#146;s all you expect of a man You knew for sure he was proud to meet you By the genuine shake of his hand &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant you could depend On this man no matter the task Never got too tough, too cold, or too late For his help, all you need do is ask &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he had a light hand Be it with horses or cattle or crew He spent most of his life learning this cowboy trade And he&#146;d be honored to teach it to you &#147;There&#146; a good feller&#148; meant don&#146;t ask him to do What ain&#146;t on a true and honest track He knows it&#146;s easier to keep a good reputation Than it is to try to build one back &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he&#146;s a fair minded man He helped write cowboyin&#146;s unwritten laws He won&#146;t ask you to do what he wouldn&#146;t do Yet knows, at times, the short end you&#146;ll draw &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant, when he&#146;s down on his luck He can still hold his head way up high &#145;Cause he did his best and gave it his all He knows with faith and God&#146;s help he&#146;ll get by &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words And their meaning won&#146;t run all that deep But when Dad would use &#145;em to describe certain men You knew they were at the top of the heap &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words But they&#146;ve always been favorites of mine If after my trails end, my name&#146;s brought up &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148; would suit me just fine Jay Snider, All rights reserved The Cattle Market Me and the cattle market need to get in synch This terminal poverty is a bunch of bull When the market goes up, I won&#146;t own but three When it&#146;s down, my pastures are full Now I&#146;m not one for gripin&#146; And I dearly love this life But fifty- cent calves and ten dollar feed Is hard to explain to my wife But she wouldn&#146;t trade it for a job in town The new babies, she names &#145;em all And she&#146;ll be mad for two months runnin&#146; When I sell &#145;em off in the fall I&#146;ve read and studied genetics I think my breeding program is keen But I have an idea I&#146;m missin&#146; something Cause my calves all looks Holstein Blacks and baldies are the packer&#146;s choice I thought I&#146;d have &#145;er made last fall But calving time proved disappointing The neighbor&#146;s longhorn had sired &#145;em all This year&#146;s crop is a sight to behold I&#146;ve been assured they&#146;re some of the best But my banker will get almost all they bring And Ivomec will get the rest My fences are in need of major repairs And I&#146;m just nearly out of hay But if the market stays up, I won&#146;t own but three cows And I won&#146;t need fences anyway Forty- percent cubes are the best you can buy To hear the man at the Co-op tell it But I buy the cheap twenty- percent kind So my cows can have more than one pellet My banker agrees that I need some help But that ranchin&#146;sure ain&#146;t my callin&#146; He allows I ought to sell off my cows Cause the darned market&#146;s started fallin&#146; If the bottom falls out of the market now I&#146;ll have way too many again So I&#146;ll sell &#145;em off and cut my loss But now I&#146;m right back where I&#146;ve been When spring grass comes, I&#146;ll buy some back Cause without &#145;em I&#146;d sooner die I&#146;ll bet a hundred the market will be up And they&#146;ll be too darned high to buy So I&#146;ll patiently wait till the market goes down And I can buy &#145;em real cheap you see Then I&#146;ll keep &#145;em and feed &#145;em till the market goes up Or till my \nbanker takes all but &#145;bout three 2000, Jay Snider, All rights reserved Two of a Kind I thought he&#146;d lost his

reactions balance Chemical compounds are made of elements The body has the ability \nto defend against a disease after it has had that disease, or a similar disease (called immunization) Heat can kill microorganisms Gentlemanly pursuits (1800 - Pasteur) Elements are composed of atoms with identical and constant mass Atoms are unchanged during chemical reaction Catalysts speed reactions, but remain unaffected by the reaction Microorganisms reproduce Some microorganisms cause disease Some pathogens are transmitted from human feces to humans through drinking water Mssr. Pasteur (1857-1876) There is no spontaneous generation Some microorganisms can live in the absence of oxygen You can grow microorganisms on a defined medium The acidity of a medium affects how microorganisms grow Organisms evolve to fill biological niches Characteristics are inherited Microorganisms have nutritional requirements Protozoa can cause disease Herr Koch (1876-1888) Some bacteria make spores, which can resist adverse conditions Sterilization obeys kinetic rules It is possible to isolate a single species by dilution Some pathogens take on weakened forms which can be used to immunize Isolation and pure culture work is easier on solid media Bacteria can be resolved from its surroundings by staining It is possible to filter bacteria from water Some bacteria excrete toxins Killed organisms can be used to immunize Boom Time (1888-1900) Bacteria can make ammonia out of dinitrogen Some bacteria oxidize inorganics to get their metabolic energy Bacteria have flagella, which they use to move Fecal bacteria produce gas during fermentation There are sub-microscopic components in serum able to attack pathogens Chemicals (dyes) can kill bacteria in the body Bacteria have cell walls and plasma membranes Serum from immune animals causes agglomeration of pathogens Antibodies specifically bind antigens Chemical agents such as metals can kill bacteria Microorganisms have internal components which are able to catalyze reactions There are sub-microscopic pathogens Expansion Into A Science (1900-1920) Metabolism occurs as a series of reactions Biological oxidations involve transfer of electrons from a donor to an alternative acceptor Some microorganisms require vitamins to live Mutants occur Natural waters self-clean Bacteria spontaneously mutate Acidity can be quantified by pH Antibodies bind to very well-defined and specific antigens The Widening Gyre (1920-1940) Enzymes are proteins Cells occasionally take up genetic material Some microorganisms make toxins against other microorganisms Enzymes are made by bacteria in correspondence with their environment Metabolism consists of series of reactions catalyzed by enzymes specific to each reaction which are common to all organisms Genes (1941-1953) Genes code for specific metabolic function Cells use phosphate bonds as energy sources Microorganisms show a preference for some foods DNA is genetic material Bacteria trade genes Radiolabels can be used to trace a reaction Bacteria sometimes fuse and trade genes There are non-chromosomal genes DNA codes for different amino acids using a

added primers will \"find\" their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA and bind they then act as the \"starting site\" for new DNA synthesis Given a mix of nucleotides, the right enzymes, and energy, the primers will initiate synthesis of complementary DNA strands note that, for every double-stranded DNA fragment used, two copies are produced - just like in \"normal\" DNA replication in cells Then, the process is repeated: each new double-stranded DNA fragment is denatured, primers are added, etc. so the process is exponential: with each round of the process, the number of DNA fragments is doubled This technique has been very useful in many fields: in forensics, small amounts of DNA can be fingerprinted to help identify perpetrators in medicine, if we know what genes we're looking for, PCR allows us to detect even very low levels of viral DNA or DNA from cancer cells from blood samples in other areas of science, we can use PCR to analyze DNA from very small tissue samples, e.g. from ancient human bones, from insects in amber, etc. Manipulating genes: recombinant DNA technology Recombinant DNA = a DNA molecule that contains pieces that aren't found together in nature - examples include adding human genes to bacteria to generate usable proteins modifying viral DNA to make safer vaccines introduction of human genes to goats produces goats that secrete valuable proteins in their milk Gene therapy: providing \"good\" copies of genes to \"cure\" genetic diseases Once the desired gene has been isolated and synthesized, it needs to be incorporated into a vector = a system for transferring the gene into the target organism/cells/tissues two commonly-used vectors are plasmids and retroviruses using a plasmid vector to transform bacteria: selelct a plasmid that has a specific antibiotic-resistance gene use a restriction enzyme to cut the plasmid in such a way as to produce \"sticky ends\" that match the \"sticky ends\" of the DNA use DNA ligase to seal the DNA into the plasmid expose bacteria to transformed plasmids - some bacteria will take up the plasmids, some won't plate the bacteria on media containing the antibiotic to which the transformed plasmids are resistant bacteria lacking the recombinant plasmid will die, leaving behind bacteria that have successfully incorporated the recombinant plasmid Plasmid vectors

the other (host) is harmed example - infections that lead to damage of host tissues by the parasite, which causes disease (occurs in plants as well as animals) Commensalism association in which one organism (commensal) benefits, while the other (host) is neither helped nor harmed example - Clostridium and other microbes live in the human colon where they benefit from nutrients, warmth and shelter, but generally do not cause disease (normal microbiota) Mutualism association in which both organisms (mutuals) benefit examples: Escherichia coli lives in the human colon and benefits from nutrients, warmth and shelter found there, generally not causing disease, but benefiting the host by producing vitamins and preventing growth of harmful microbes lichens - associations between a mycobiont (ascomycete) and a phycobiont (green alga or cyanobacterium) mycobiont provides a stable environment (protects from excessive light, supplies water and minerals, provides a firm substrate) within which the phycobiont can grow somewhat free from environmental stress phycobiont provides oxygen, organic carbon, other nutrients for both microbes mostly ectosymbiotic, although some fungi obtain nutrients from their phycobionts using haustoria (projections of hyphae that penetrate the phycobiont cell wall) protozoan symbiosis with bacteria and archaea Personympha (a protozoan that lives in the gut of termites) can digest cellulose only because it has cellulase-producing endosymbiotic bacteria Metopus contortus (an anaerobic cilliated protozoan) has a number of symbiotes two endosymbiotes hydrogenosomes - degenerate bacteria that use pyruvate and NADH (both generated via glycolytic catabolism of the cilliate) to generate CO 2 , H 2 and acetate methanogens - use CO 2 and H 2 generated in the hydrogenosomes to generate methane one ectosymbiote - sulfate-reducing bacteria oxidize the acetate generated in the hydrogenosomes to obtain energy via anaerobic respiration and reduce sulfate in the process Strombidium purpureum - anaerobic protozoan that has photosynthetic purple sulfur bacteria living in its cytoplasm and furnishing it with energy rumen ectosymbiosis -

of the prokaryotes Used to be classified as the only member of the kingdom Monera Present classification identifies two kingdoms of bacteria Archaebacteria Eubacteria Bacteria Are an Extremely Diverse Group of Organisms fig 30.11 Few major structural differences Species differentiation based on metabolic processes Characterized by growth on certain defined media Activities altered by growth conditions and chemicals Role of Bacteria Responsible for creating properties of atmosphere and soils Are autotrophic, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic, contribute to world carbon balance Are heterotrophic and break down organic compounds Only a few genera of bacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen Involved in industrial processes and chemical syntheses Produce acetic acid, vinegar, amino acids, enzymes Production of various milk products, bread and ethanol Antibiotics derived from bacterial sources Genetic engineering applications PROKARYOTES VERSUS EUKARYOTES Structural Differences Multicellularity: bacteria are fundamentally single-celled fig 30.11e, 12 May adhere within matrix, some form filaments Few integrated activities between cells Primitive colonial forms include gliding bacteria fig 30.11d Cell size: extremely small individual cell size Chromosomes: non-membrane bound DNA is circular and lacks proteins Cell division and genetic recombination Simple division via binary fission True sexual reproduction absent, genetic recombination irregular Internal compartmentalization: Lack membrane-bound organelles Enzymes are bound to cell membrane Only organelles present are ribosomes Flagella: possess simple flagella fig 30.1a,c,13 Composed of single flagellin fiber Lack 9 + 2 structure of eukaryotic flagella and cilia fig 5.26 Flagellar motion resembles spinning propeller, not whip-like motion Metabolic Diversity: Eukaryotes exhibit only one form of photosynthesis Bacteria exhibit several patterns of photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic Bacteria undergo chemosynthesis and fix atmospheric nitrogen BACTERIAL STRUCTURE Cell Wall Structure Polysaccharide network with polypeptide crosslinks fig 30.14 Classed as gram-positive or gram-negative Gram-positive composed of polysaccharide network Gram-negative have additional lipopolysaccharide chains Gram-negative are less susceptible to antibiotics May be surrounded by

individual cells Rapid multiplication in short time period Increase number with favorable mutations Rapidly changes characteristics of a population Plays important role in genetic diversity Example: development of antibiotic resistance Genetic Recombination Transfer of genes via viruses, plasmids, other DNA fragments Examples Rapid transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids Transfer of pathogenic characteristics among enteric bacteria Rapid generation time is an alternative evolutionary strategy BACTERIA AS PLANT PATHOGENS Cause Costly Plant Diseases Symptoms are generally spots on stems,

\nfrequently mutate to drug-resistant strains Gonorrhea Most prevalent communicable disease, cause by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium Transmitted during sexual activities through transfer of body fluids Can spread to eyes (conjunctivitis) and internal organs, cause arthritic meningitis Symptoms in women and men are generally mild and go unnoticed Treatment via combination of antibiotics Syphilis Less common as a result of blood-screening procedures and antibiotic treatment Caused by spirochaete bacterium, Treponema palladum Transmitted during intercourse, direct contact with sore or from mother to fetus Disease progresses in four distinct stages Primary stage characterized by chancre sore, highly infectious stage Secondary stage distinguished by body rash Third stage shows no symptoms, may last years Fourth stage is heart disease, mental deficiency, nerve damage, loss of motor functions, blindness Treated via antibiotics Genital herpes Caused by two types of closely related viruses Herpes simplex Type 1 causes cold sores and fever blisters Herpes simplex type 2 causes genital lesions of genital herpes Transmitted through sexual contact when open sores are evident Herpes virus in body travels along nerve endings to base of spine May remain dormant with no symptoms May become active and produce painful symptoms Initial outbreak produces measle-like lesions, flu-like symptoms May become dormant, outbreaks reappear with stress or exposure to sun Antiviral drugs can lessen severity of outbreaks, not a cure Transmission possible during outbreaks Chlamydia \"Silent STD\" caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium Has both bacterial and viral characteristics Susceptible to antibiotics like bacterium Depends on host cell to replicate, like virus Transmitted via sexual intercourse Women usually do not experience symptoms until infection is established Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease Can lead to sterility, increase risk of acquiring HIV Symptoms in men include watery discharge, burning or itching Tests exist to identify bacteria in discharge Treatment via antibiotics mostly tetracycline, penicillin not effective Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Transmission through contact with infected person fig 30.17 More than 30 strains, three known to cause cervical cancer Warts appear in genital region three weeks to three months after exposure Treatment through various agents to remove warts Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Archaebacteria are distinctly different from all other bacteria Base sequences of rRNA virtually identical in all members Differ from sequences in other bacteria and eukaryotes Cell walls lack muramic acid Have distinctive membranes, unusual cell walls, unique metabolic cofactors Capable of living in anaerobic atmosphere rich in CO2 and H2 Include oldest life forms, ancestral to Eubacteria and eukaryotes Independent evolution of each group Some have ribosomes similar to eukaryotes Others have smaller ribosomes like Eubacteria Include methanogens that produce methane gas Produce marsh gas, natural gas and reduce elemental sulfur Produce own anaerobic environment, cannot function in

tissue that contains Blood vessels Peyer's patches (lymph nodes) in the submucosa - protect us from disease muscularis - smooth muscle layer - 2 layers of smooth muscle - inner = encircles the Gut - outer layer - longitudinal layer lies in the same direction as the gut serosa - serous membrane layer - thin outermost layer of squamous epitheliurn Supported by connective tissue Serosa secretes serous fluid that keeps the outer surface of the intestines moist So that the organs of the abdominal cavity slide against one another Outer layer of the esophagus is composed only of loose connective tissue Called adventitia Stomach - sac-like organ composed of the fundus (upper,rounded part ), body (main portion), and antrum (lower part) Rugae - as in the mouth, are folds in the mucosal lining Glands within the rugae secrete gastric juices that aids in digestion and forms a Protective coating on the lining of the stomach pylorus - narrow passage which connects the stomach with the small intestine Pyloric sphincter - muscle that controls the flow between the stomach and the Duodenum Columnar epithelium has gastic pits which lead to gastric glands, produce gastric juice Gastric juice contains pepsin - digests protein Also HCI and mucous HCI - gives the stomach its acidity - pH =2 which helps kill most bacteria Present in food, it does not digest food but does break down Connective tissue found in meat and activates pepsin Mucous secreted by the goblet cells protects the stomach lining from the acidity If the HCI penetrates the mucous, the wall can begin to break down - it is now believed That Helicobacter pylon (bacteria) impairs the ability of epithelial cells to Produce the protective mucous Stomach absorbs alcohol but not food - food leaves the stomach as a thick soupy Liquid called chyme - chyme leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine Small Intestines - small bowel - extends from the stomach to the large intestines 3 parts: Duodenum 1 st portion - from the pylorus to the jejunum Jejunum - middle portion - from the duodenum to the ileum Ileum - last portion - from the jejunum to the cecum of the large intestine Ileocecal vale - between the ileum and the large intestines - prevents backflow of waste Controlled by ileocecal sphincter Bile is secreted into the small intestine from the liver and pancreatic juice is secreted into the small intestine from the pancreas - bile emulsifies fat Into droplets to disperse in water pH of the small intestine is slightly basic to neutralize the chyme enzymes from the pancreas help complete the digestion process The surface area of the wall of the small intestine is approximately that of a tennis court due to fingerlike projections called villi and additional projections called microvilli this is for maximum absorption of nutrients into the cardiovascular (glucose and fatty acids) system and lymphatic (fats) system Regulation of digestive hormones: Although the nervous system plays a part in the secretion of digestive juices - so do hormones hormones - substance produced by one set of cells that affects a different set of cells Called target cells if one eats a meal rich in protein - stomach produces the hormone gastrin - enters the Bloodstream - soon the stomach begins churning, and the secretory activity of Gastric glands increases duodenal wall produces GIP (gastric inhibiting peptide) - works opposite from gatrin To inhibit gastrin secretion Also secretes secretin - whose release is stimulated by the HCI in the chyme And CCK - cholecystokinin - whose release is stimulated by partially Digested protein and fats Once \nthese hormones enter the bloodstream - the liver begins secreting bile into The small intestine and pancreas begins secreting pancreatic juices into The small intestine Large Intestine - from the small intestine to the anus 4 parts: Cecum - pouch that lies on the right side of the abdomen - from the ileum to the Colon Colon -3 parts: Ascending colon - cecum to the undersurface of the liver Transverse colon - passes horizontally to the left towards the Spleen Descending colon- travels down the left side of the abdominal Cavity to the signioid cavity Sigmoid colon ~3rd major part of the large intestine - from the descending colon To the rectum Rectum - last division of the large intestine Anus - lower opening of the gastrointestinal tract 2 anal sphincter muscles control the anus Defecation is the expulsion of feces - 3 quarters water, and ~ quarter solids The color is caused by the bilirubin and the odor is produced by the breaking Down of products as the bacteria work on the undigested material obligate anaerobes are the main bacteria present in the large intestine --they break Down undigestive food and produce vitamins and other molecules the large Intestine absorbs polyps - colon can develop polyps - small growths arising from the epithelial lining - can be Benign or cancerous - are surgically removable researchers believe increased fat intake can lead to cancer because of the increase in Bile secretion caused by fat also - increase in fiber intake decreases the chances of colon cancer - fiber absorbs water and adds bulk - diluting the concentration of bile salts and facilitating the Movement of substances through the intestine Regular elimination decreases the intestines exposure to cancer promoting Agents diarrhea - caused by infections of the lower tract and nervous stimulation each case the intestinal wall is stimulated due to irritation or nervous stimulation Peristalsis increases and water is not absorbed - resulting in diarrhea constipation - feces are dry and hard - many times resulting from one ignoring the urge to Defecate increased water and fiber intake can help prevent constipation Liver - located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (hepatic - pertaining to the liver) functions: Removes excess glucose from the bloodstream and stores it as glycogen Converts glycogen back to glucose when needed Destroys old erythrocytes (red blood cells) Removes poisons from the blood Manufactures some blood proteins Manufactures bile, digestive juices (stored on the gallbladder) Bilirubin is also released by the liver into the bile Removes bilirubin from the blood Produces lipids from fatty acids - produces and helps regulate cholesterol Produces urea from the breakdown of amino acids Stores iron and the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,and K) Jaundice - when bilirubin is deposited in the skin due to an abnormally large amount in The blood - person has yellowish tint to the whites of the eyes and the skin Hepatitis - inflammation if the liver - several forms of viral hepatitis A - get from sewage contaminated drinking water B - spread by sexual contact, blood transfilsions or contaminated needles More contagious than AIDS virus (Vaccine available) C - acquired by contact with infected blood - leads to chronic hep or liver cancer Cirrhosis - often due to alcoholism but not always Organ becomes fatty and the liver tissue is replaced by inactive fibrous scar tissue Liver can regenerate if the rate of regeneration exceeds the rate of damage if the liver Has not already reached the point of failure Gallbladder - pear shaped muscular sac attached to the bottom of the liver Stores and concentrates bile for later use - water is reabsorbed by the gallbladder so that the bile becomes a thick, mucous-like material - when bile is Needed it leaves the gallbladder and travels down the common bile duct and Enters the duodenum cholesterol can come out of the bile solution and crystalize in the gallbladder and form Gallstones - cholelithiasis - the stones can block the common bile duct -",0.6306751370429993],["Some of these \"symbiotic\"

Oxygen-demanding wastes: organic wastes which can be aerobically decomposed by bacteria DO (dissolved oxygen) - oxygen content BOD (biological oxygen demand) - amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic decomposers to break down the organic material in a certain volume of water over a 5-day period Inorganic plant nutrients: water-soluble nitrate and phosphate compounds that can cause excess growth of algae and aquatic vegetation Organic chemicals: oil, gasoline, plastics, pesticides, cleaning solvents, detergents and many other water-soluble and insoluble chemicals Sediment or suspended matter: insoluble particles of soil and other solid inorganic and organic materials Radioactive substances: radioisotopes that are water soluble or capable of being biologically amplified to higher concentrations as they pass through food chains and webs Heat: excess input of water that is heated - used mostly to cool electrical power plants Sources of pollution: Point: pollution discharged at specific locations through pipes, ditches, or sewers into bodies of surface waterNonpoint: big land areas that discharge pollutants into surface and underground waters Stream and river pollution - usually recover rapidly from heat and oxygen-demanding wastes due to flow - often not a major concern - cities get their drinking water upstream and discharge sewage downstream Lake pollution - less flow for dilution and mixing - stratification prevents mixing, resulting in excess nutrient loading - cultural eutrophication - input of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) accelerated by human activities Prevention methods: use advanced waste treatment to remove phosphates from effluents ban or set low limits on phosphates for detergents and cleaning products control land uses, use sound soil conservation practices protect coastal and inland wetlands that filter and retain nutrients Cleanup Methods: dredge bottom sediments to remove excess nutrients remove or harvest excess weedscontrol nuisance plants with herbicides and algicidespump air through lakes to avoid oxygen depletion Ocean pollution: the ultimate sink for much of the waste matter produced can dilute, disperse, and degrade large amounts of sewage, sludges, oil, and some types of industrial waste, especially in deep waters marine organisms tend to be more resilient to exposure about 2 million birds and 100,000 marine mammals die when they ingest or become entangled in plastic cups, bags, six-pack yolks, nets, ropes, and other forms of trash 80% dredge spoils - materials scraped from the bottoms of harbors and shipping channels 20% sewage sludges - mixture of toxic chemicals, infectious agents, and settled solids removed from wastewater at sewage treatment plants Oil pollution: most actually comes from waste oils disposed onto the lands by individuals, industries, and cities - tanker accidents and well blowouts most visible but account for only about 20% Groundwater pollution: most groundwater is renewed so slowly that any contamination may be considered permanent natural removal of bacteria and suspended solid particles as water percolates through soils into aquifers slow flow, cold temperatures, and lack of oxygen greatly extends time from wastes to degrade Preventing contamination may be the only effective way to protect groundwater by banning virtually all disposal of hazardous wastes in sanitary landfills and injection wells monitoring of existing landfills and wells for leakage placing stricter controls on chemical applications establishing national groundwater standards Controlling surface water pollution: Nonpoint source: primarily agricultural - reduce excess fertilizer and pesticide use, control feedlot runoff, reforest watersheds Point source: wastewater lagoons - large ponds where air, sunlight, and microorganisms can break down wastes septic systems primary sewage treatment - mechanical screening of debris such as sticks, stones, rags secondary sewage treatment - aerobic bacteria degrade and remove up to 90% of biodegradable oxygen-demanding organic waste advanced sewage treatment - specialized chemical and physical processes that lower the quantities of specific pollutants US Water Pollution Control Laws Safe Drinking Water Act (1974): required EPA to establish maximum contamination levels for any pollutant that \"may\" have adverse effects on human health: 97 cause cancer, 82 mutations, 28 toxic, 23 promote tumors - by 1993 only 84 of 700+ set Federal Water Pollution Act of 1972 (renamed the Clean Water Act of 1977) and 1987 Water Quality Act: established to control pollution of surface waters required EPA to set standards for effluents and monitoring water quality as a result most cities now have secondary sewage
