widget that displays a complete list of items, and a scrolling list widget that only displays some of the items and lets the user scroll through this list the scrolling list widget really isn't a primitive widget, it consists of a List widget and a Scrollbar widget, but its useful for handling long lists, or when you don't know the length of the list all the items in a List widget are compound strings the items can be added all at once using one of the List widget resources and XtSetValues, or one of the Motif functions can be used to add the items one at a time, this is usually the approach that is used a List widget can be in one of four selection modes, each selection mode has a different callback list, which makes switching modes rather inconvenient in the prototyping stage the four selection modes are: Single Select - at most one item can be selected, selecting an item de-selects the previous selection Browse Select - like single select, only one selection, but dragging the mouse with the button down moves the selection through the list Multiple Select - more than one item can be selected, clicking the item toggles its state, but has no effect on the other items Extended Select - more than one item can be selected at a time, when the user presses the left mouse button previous items are de-selected and new ones selected by dragging the mouse, the right mouse button can be used to extend the selection for exact details on when the callbacks are called see the man pages, the callbacks receive both the compound strings for the selected items and their positions within the list Scrollbar the Scrollbar widget is usually part of a group of widgets used to implement various types of scrolling windows, but it can also be used on its own even when used in a scrolling widget, knowledge of its resources and behavior is useful a Scrollbar widget has a slider that can move from one end to the other of the widget, the user can directly move the slider by dragging it there are arrows at each end of the Scrollbar, clicking these arrows move the slider by a (small) increment, clicking outside of the arrows causes a page increment, which is larger there are callbacks for both types of increments, and for when the slider is dragged the XmNvalueChangedCallback is called whenever the slider value changes, except during a dragging operation the important Scollbar resources are: XmNminimum - the minimum value for the scrollbar XmNmaximum - the maximum value for the scrollbar XmNvalue - the current value of the scrollbar XmNsliderSize - the size of the slider, in scrolled windows this is proportional to the percentage of the document displayed XmNincrement - the size of a small increment XmNpageIncrement - the size of a page increment Scale the Scale widget is similar to the Scrollbar widget, except that its main purpose is to enter a scalar value \na Scale widget has a maximum, minimum and current value, but there is no way of controlling the size of the slider the XmNvalueChangedCallback is called whenever the Scale's value is changed, and the XmNdragCallBack is called when the slider is dragged the Scale widget has a label and can also display its current value as a text string the scale widget can have children, which are used to provide tick marks and max and min label for the scale if there are only two children they are placed at opposite ends of the scale, otherwise they are placed at equal intervals along the scale Text and TextField the Text and TextField widgets are used to display and edit text the main difference between these widget is that a TextField only displays one line of text, and a Text widget can display many lines of text both of these widgets are fairly complete text editors and can be used for basic text editing applications these widgets store text as standard C text strings, they are the only Motif widgets that don't use compound strings for text several Text widgets can share the same internal text string, this can be used to produce multi-window browsers and editors on the same text file the man pages provide the details on using these widgets Composite Widgets a composite widget is a widget that has children these are the widgets that form the interior nodes of the widget tree Motif has a rich set of composite widgets, these widgets are divided into a number of groups that are briefly described below Simple Composite Widgets simple composite widgets either manage only one widget, or manage a collection of widgets in a fixed way these widgets basically don't do any geometry management, they just provide a container for other widgets Scrolled Window the ScrolledWindow widget is used when there isn't enough screen area to display the contents of a widget, the widget becomes the main child of the ScrolledWindow widget the ScrolledWindow widget can also have two scroll bars as children, one of horizontal scrolling and the other for vertical scrolling if the ScrolledWindow is in Automatic mode is automatically controls the scrolling of its child widget in this case another child widget, called the view widget is created the view widget is the same size as the inside of the ScrolledWindow, the visible part of the main child widget is copied to the view widget whenever the scrollbars are moved in this way the main child widget isn't aware that it is part of a ScrolledWidget, the visible part is copied automatically if the ScrolledWindow widget is in Application_Defined mode the application is responsible for all the scrolling operations the application provides callbacks for the scroll bars, and is responsible for displaying the visible part of the main widget Paned Window the PanedWindow widget lays out its child vertically from top to bottom there is a sash separating the windows, this sash can be dragged to change the size of the windows each widget can have a minumum and maximum size, the child can be resized within this range a child can have a fixed size, when the user drags one of the sashes attached to it, it stays the same size but its position will change within the parent Frame a Frame widget provides a frame or shadow for its child it can have a second child that serves as a title this widget is mainly used to decorate its child window Main Window the MainWindow widget is designed to be the main widget of an application this widget has a number of standard children it can have a menu bar and a command area at the top of the widget and a status widget at the bottom the main child of this widget is the work area that occupies most of the screen space the MainWindow widget can also manage scroll bars for the work area the widget forms a basic frame for the construction of many simple applications Geometry Management Widgets these widgets provide some form of geometry management for their children they use a layout algorithm to place their children BulletinBoard and DrawingArea these two widgets provide minimal geometry management, they largely rely on their children to place themselves this can be done by specifying values for the XmNx, XmNy, XmNheight and XmNwidth resources these widgets have one resource that has a major impact on geometry management, XmNresizePolicy, the possible values for this resource are: XmRESIZE_NONE - the widget can't change size XmRESIZE_GROW - the widget can increase in size, if one of its children wants more space, but it can't decrease XmRESIZE_ANY - the widget can both increase and decrease in size RowColumn the RowColumn widget provides a grid based layout, this can be rectangular, or a single row or column the XmNorientation resource controls how the widgets are placed in the grid, it has two possible values: XmVERTICAL - the widgets are placed vertically one after the other until the end of the column is reached, then the next column is started XmHORIZONTAL - the widgets are placed horizontally one after the other until the end of the row is reached, then the next row is started the way the widgets are packed into the RowColumn widget is controlled by the XmNpacking resource, which has the following values: XmPACK_TIGHT - the row or column is completely filled, in the case of columns all the widgets are made the same width, and in the case of rows all the widgets are made the same height XmPACK_COLUMN - in this case the RowColumn widget attempts to make a grid of the child widgets, all the widgets are made the same width and height, the RowColumn determines the number of row and columns required to produce a complete grid and constructs it XmPACK_NONE - no attempt is made at formatting the widgets there are resources \nfor controlling the space between widgets, and how labels are centered, etc Form the form widget has the most complicated layout rules the layout is specified in terms of a set of constraints, the constraints are attached to the child widgets that is, the resources that control the layout are not part of the Form widget, they are attached to the child widgets there are 17 resources that can be used to control the layout the XmNresizable resource controls whether the child's size can be changed for each side of the widget there are four resources that specify the constraints for that side, for the top side these resources are: XmNtopAttachment - this resources controls the position of the top edge of the widget, it can have the following values: XmATTACH_NONE - the top of the widget isn't controlled by a constraint XmATTACH_FORM - the top side of the widget is attached to the top side of the form XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM - the top of the widget is attached to the bottom of the form, the XmNtopOffset resource can be used to control the distance from the top of the widget and the bottom of the form XmATTACH_WIDGET - the top of the child is attached to the bottom of another widget, this widget is specified by the XmNtopWidget resource XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET - the top of the child is attached to the top of another widget XmATTACH_POSITION - the top of the child is attach to a position that is relative to the top of the form, the XmNtopPosition resource is used for this XmATTACH_SELF - attach the widget to a position that is proportional to its current y value, I'm not sure why this would be used XmNtopOffset - a constant offset between the top of the widget and the widget that it is attached to XmNtopWidget - the widget that the top is attached to XmNtopPosition - used to determine the relative position of the top of the widget, this value is divided by the Form widgets XmNfractionBase resource to get a value between 0 and 1, the height of the Form widget is multiplied by this fraction to get the distance from the top of the form to the top of the widget there are similar resources for the bottom, left and right sides of the widget by combining these resources you can control if the child changes size when the parent changes size or stays the same basic size for example if the top and bottom of the widget are attached to the top and bottom of the form, then the widget will grow with the form, but if both edges are attached to the top, it will remain the same size Shells a shell widget has only one child, and this child occupies the shell's entire screen area shell widgets form the interface between the application and the window manager they are usually not displayed, and in most cases the programmer isn't aware of them the top level widget of each application is a shell widget, it handles the window manage communications for the application each menu has a shell widget, this allows the menu to pop up over the application's other windows, without the shell the menu would be restricted to its parent's screen area dialogs also have shell widgets for the same reason Menus there are several types of menus in Motif, at this point standard menu bar based menus will be described, popup menus will be described after events have been discussed all menu widgets must have shells associated with them, the RowColumn widget is used for menus, so when one is created XtCreateWidget is usually not used, instead one of the Motif convenience functions that also creates the shell widget is used a menu bar can be created by calling the XmCreateMenuBar procedure, which has the following declaration:

EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY Key Evolutionary Innovations Have Occurred in the Animals Progressive nature of animal evolution Key elements of body architecture fig 38.1 Body Plan Results from Gene Programmed Development SOME GENERAL FEATURES OF ANIMALS All Animals Are Heterotrophs Depend on photosynthetic organisms directly or indirectly Most are able to move from place to place in search of food Ingestion of food is followed by digestion within an internal cavity All Animals Are Multicellular Unicellular heterotrophs, \"Protozoa,\" are Protists At least ten million species are currently alive Most animals are invertebrates Only 1% of all species are vertebrates Animals are diverse in form and include 35 phyla Size ranges from microscopic forms to enormous whales Most are marine, some are freshwater, few are terrestrial Arthropods, mollusks and chordates dominate the land Animals Constructed in a Common Manner Lack cell walls and are relatively flexible Cells are generally organized into tissues, except for sponges Are capable of movement Directly related to flexibility of cells Flying is the most specialized form of locomotion Most reproduce sexually Nonmotile eggs are much larger than motile sperm Cells formed by meiosis function directly as gametes There is no animal counterpart to plant gametophyte or sporophyte Adults and young are generally diploid Gametes are the only haploid cells Zygote becomes an adult through process of embryonic development Zygote divides mitotically forming a hollow ball of cells, a blastula This ball folds inward to form a hollow sac, a gastrula Opening of sac called the blastopore Cells subsequently grow and move in relation to one another Details differ from one phylum to another, but provide clues regarding their evolutionary relationships ANIMALS WITHOUT TISSUES: SPONGES Sponges Are the Simplest of Animals Lack definite symmetry Cells not organized into tissues fig 38.2 Body is little more than a mass of specialized cells Cells exhibit cell recognition Key property of animal cells Sponge passed through mesh will reaggregate General Biology of Sponges Adults are anchored to sea floor fig 38.3 Functions as water-filtering machine Body is vase shaped, perforated by tiny holes Choanocytes: specialized flagellated cells that line internal cavity Water forced through passageways by beating flagella Food particles in water trapped and ingested Choanocytes structurally resembles choanoflagellates Protist with a single flagellum Likely ancestor of sponges ADVENT OF TISSUE LEADS TO GREATER SPECIALIZATION: CNIDARIANS Animals Other than Sponges are Eumetazoans Possess definite symmetry Form three distinct cell layers Outer ectoderm, inner endoderm, intermediate mesoderm Layers give rise to tissues of adult body Ectoderm forms coverings of body and nervous system Mesoderm forms skeleton and muscles Endoderm forms digestive organs and intestines Most Primitive Eumetazoans Are Radially Symmetrical Body parts arranged around a central axis Exemplified by two phyla Cnidaria: hydroids, jellyfish, sea anemones and corals fig 38.4 Ctenophora: comb jellies fig 38.5 All other eumetazoans are fundamentally bilaterally symmetrical Echinoderm adults radially symmetrical, larvae bilaterally symmetrical General Biology of Cnidarians Carnivores, capture food with tentacles that surround mouth Possess cnidocytes: specialized structures located on tentacles Exhibit two body forms Polyp: cylindrical, generally attached to a substrate Medusa: umbrella-shaped, free floating, gelatinous Evolutionary innovation: extracellular digestion of food Sponge choanocyte or amoeboid cell takes food particle directly into itself Cnidarians digest food outside of cells in a gut cavity Same strategy pursued by fungi, but process occurs outside of body Innovation retained by all other advanced groups of animals Animals then able to digest something larger than its own cells BILATERAL SYMMETRY: SOLID WORMS Comparison of Bilateral Symmetry to Radial Symmetry fig 38.6 Bilateral symmetry found in all higher forms Bilateral organisms exhibit right and left halves, mirror images to each other Allows for differential adaptation of various parts of body Evolution of cephalization Move through environment headfirst Evolved various sensory organs generally grouped at head end More efficient in seeking food and avoiding predators fig 38.7 Simplest Bilaterally Symmetrical Animals Are the Solid Worms Largest phylum is Platyhelminthes, includes flatworms fig 38.8 Simplest phylum in which organs occur Organ: collection of different tissues that function as one unit Example: reproductive organs, testes and uterus General biology Dorsoventrally flattened bodies Bodies are solid, gut is the only internal cavity Body construction is acoelomate, without a body cavity fig 38.9 Bodies must be thin to allow diffusion of gases and nutrients Digestive system is branched with a single opening Most species are parasitic THE ADVENT OF A BODY CAVITY: ROUNDWORMS All Other Bilaterally Symmetrical Animals Possess a Body Cavity fig 38.10 Importance of the evolution of a body cavity Circulation: Fluids moving within cavity function as a \ncirculatory system Movement: fluid in cavity makes body rigid Organ function: organs can function without being deformed Food movement not controlled by locomotion of animal Digestion and waste removal more efficient Pseudocoelomate Animals fig 38.9 Include seven phyla Body cavity, pseudocoel, located between endoderm and mesoderm Have complete, one-way digestive tracts Nematoda contains the most members, most are microscopic fig 38.11 BUILDING A BETTER BODY CAVITY: MOLLUSKS Coelomates Constitute the Bulk of the Animal Kingdom Coelom body cavity develops entirely within mesoderm fig 38.12 Supports various evolutionary relationships Acoelomates could give rise to coelomates or be derived from them Pseudocoelomate phyla could all have different origins Success of Coelomate Body Cavity Stems from Embryonic Development During primary induction primary tissues interact with each other Coelomate body plan allows necessary contact between mesoderm and endoderm Permits development of localized portions of digestive tract, i.e. stomach Mesoderm and endoderm separated by body cavity in psuedocoelomates Limits developmental interactions Coelom allows digestive tract to be longer than animal's body length Allows for storage of undigested food or food remnants: limits exposure to predators Longer exposure of food to enzymes improves digestion Tube-within-a-tube design allows for more flexibility and greater mobility Architecture of the coelomate animal Gut and internal organs suspended in coelom Coelom surrounded by epithelium layer, derived from mesoderm Parietal peritoneum lines outer wall Visceral peritoneum lines internal organs within cavity Internal body cavity provides space for expansion of gonads Allows for accumulation of eggs and sperm Advanced phyla able to evolve diverse reproductive strategies Large numbers of gametes stored and released under favorable conditions Requires development of sophisticated circulatory system Network of vessels carries fluid, blood, to all parts of body Blood carries nutrients and oxygen to tissues Removes wastes and carbon dioxide from tissues Circulation effected by contraction of muscular hearts Mollusks Are the Least Advanced Coelomates Only major coelomates without segmented bodies Second largest phylum of animals Second most successful land animals, next to insects More terrestrial mollusks than terrestrial vertebrates fig 38.13 Mollusk bodies composed of three segments: head, central visceral mass, foot Three classes: Gastropods, Bivalves, Cephalopods THE RISE OF SEGMENTATION: ANNELIDS Early Innovation in Coelomates Was Segmentation Body built from series of similar segments fig 38.14 Like prefabricated building Segmentation obvious in mesoderm early on Later reflected in endoderm and ectoderm Advantages to early embryonic segmentation Repetition of organ systems less lethal if one segment damaged Locomotion more effective when segments can move independently Offers evolutionary flexibility Small change in a segment can produce segment with new function Segments can be modified for various activities Segmentation First Evolved in Annelid Worms fig 38.15 Two-thirds are marine, rest are terrestrial Characterized by three principle features Repeated segments Visible as ring-like structures along body length Separated internally by partitions Each segment contains digestive, excretory and locomotor organs Fluid in segments creates hydrostatic skeleton that gives the segment rigidity Each segment can expand or contract independently Specialized segments Anterior segments modified with sensory organs Well-developed brain contained within one anterior segment Connections Provide ways for materials to pass between segments Circulatory system carries blood between segments Nerve cords connect ganglia in each segment Segmentation in Other Coelomates Present in arthropods and chordates, may not be obvious Many arthropod segments are fused Segments not apparent in human adults, visible in embryo Vertebrate muscles develop from repeated blocks called somites Vertebral column segmentation is more apparent INVENTION OF JOINTED APPENDAGES: ARTHROPODS Jointed Appendages Characteristic of the Most Successful Animal Phylum fig 38.16 Arthropod most certainly evolved from annelids fig 38.17 Arthropod segmentation not as evident as annelid segmentation Importance of jointed appendages verified in human skeletal joints Exoskeleton is a Limitation of the Arthropods Skeleton is rigid, made of chitin Muscles attach to the interior of the hard shell Provides protection, limits water loss Chitin cannot support great weight Exoskeleton must be thick to bear pull of muscles in large arthropods Extremely large arthropods are non-existent Strong flexible endoskeleton required to overcome limitation REDESIGNING THE EMBRYO: ECHINODERMS Coelomates Characterized into Two Groups by Embryology Protostomes Include mollusks, annelids, arthropods Mouth (stoma) develops from or near blastopore fig 38.18 Anus develops in another region of embryo Original state was characteristic of common ancestor of all eumetazoans Deuterostomes Includes echinoderms, chordates, few other related phyla Anus forms at or near blastopore fig 38.18 Mouth develops from another region of blastula Derived from protostome pattern of development Other Fundamental Differences Between Deuterostomes and Protostomes Present two different cleavage patterns Protostomes exhibit spiral cleavage fig 38.18 New cell buds off at oblique angle Produces closely packed array of cells Deuterostomes exhibit radial cleavage Cells divide parallel to and at right angles to polar axis Produces loosely packed array of cells Differences in developmental fate of cells Protostome cell fate is fixed when that cell first appears Individual cells will not develop into complete animal if separated Chemicals controlling developmental signals are localized early Deuterostome cell fate is fixed later in development Daughter cells from early divisions are totally identical Cells from early stages can become complete individuals Differences in development of celom from mesoderm Occurs simply and directly in protostomes Cells move away from one another Coelomic cavity expands within mesoderm Complex development in deuterostomes Groups of cells move around forming new tissue associations Coelom produced from invagination of archenteron Deuterostomes clearly derived from protostomes early in their evolution Echinoderms Were the First Deuterostomes fig 38.19 Name \"spiny skin\" refers to hard endoskeleton just beneath delicate skin Endoskeleton composed of ossicles, calcium-rich plates Are totally encase in living skin when first formed Fuse forming hard shell in adults Include sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers fig 38.20 Echinoderms exhibit secondary radial symmetry Are bilaterally symmetrical as larva Become radially symmetrical as adults Adults possess five-part body plan Lack a centralized brain or central nervous system Possess a unique \nwater vascular system Hydraulic system to aid movement Central ring with five radial canals Ultimately controls contraction or extension of hollow tube feet IMPROVING THE SKELETON: CHORDATES Chordates Employ a Truly Internal Endoskeleton fig 38.21 Characterized by flexible rod along back of embryo Muscles attach to rod providing flexible locomotion Leads to possibility of truly large animals Three features characterize chordates Single dorsal hollow nerve cord Long, stiff rod-like notochord, beneath nerve cord Pharyngeal slits located behind mouth Features may not be apparent at all times Human possess three characteristics as embryos Adult humans retain nerve cord, one pair of slits becomes Eustachian tubes Chordate Body Plan Are deuterostomes, nearest relatives are echinoderms Are more or less segmented Many have jointed appendages Vertebrates Are Specialized Group of Chordates Tunicates and lancets are non-vertebrate chordates fig 38.22 Special characteristics of vertebrates Possess
