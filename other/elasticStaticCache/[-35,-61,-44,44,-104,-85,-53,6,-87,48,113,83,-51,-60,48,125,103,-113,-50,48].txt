w this equation says that the change in energy comes from heat or work a note on the signs here, since a positive q means absorption of energy, or increased energy it is clear why it should be positive here on the other hand, work, when positive, means that the work is done by the system on the surrounding, or energy has been used to do work, so it is negative here 2.",1.974321722984314],["The thermodynamics of organized complexity Textbooks tell us that living systems are open systems dependent on energy flow.",1.9500443935394287],["The thermodynamics of organized complexity Textbooks tell us that living systems are open systems dependent on energy flow.",1.9500443935394287],["The thermodynamics of organized complexity Textbooks tell us that living systems are open systems dependent on energy flow.",1.9500443935394287],["living things adapt to their environment and specific organisms have specific adaptations and change over time living things function within our ecosystem life is dependent upon physical and mental awareness all living organisms are related because they have the same characteristics all living things are composed of systems and structures that work interdependently to sustain life the cell is the unit of structure and function of all living things Physical Science -
