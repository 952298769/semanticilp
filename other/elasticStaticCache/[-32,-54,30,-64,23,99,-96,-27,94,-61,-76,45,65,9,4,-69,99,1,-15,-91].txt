zone of the air has governed their subsequent evolution keeping birds from changing very much origin of birds the relationship between reptiles and birds has long been known feathers are modified scales - form from the same cell types during embryogenesis scales still present on epidermis of lower hindlimbs real tie came in 1861 with discovery of Archaeopteryx - (meaning ancient wing) this fossil bore the unmistakable imprint of feathers the origin of feathers has been debated a lot one theory is that they originally evolved as a way to aid in regulating body temperature later - wings evolved due to alterations in the expression of Hox genes similar alterations occurred with the Pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) and mammals (bats) by already having feathers, the early lineages of birds could readily take to flight Class Aves two original groupings flightless - ratite sternum is flat flying - carinate sternum forms a keel now realize that not all flightless birds fit into ratite category and vice versa modern classification is based on the way the palate is formed and whether it remains jointed and flexible or is a fused joint and inflexible Superorder Paleognathae inflexible fused palate most are flightless birds - ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, emus, and kiwis Superorder Neognathae - jointed, flexible palate 22 orders refer to orders in text and in lab manual know the

birds are medium ground finches ( Geospiza fortis ), which mostly eat seeds The Grants' project captured, banded, and recorded measurements and other information about all the birds on the island over a number of years, and also recorded other information about the environment, especially the availability of different kinds of seeds Early in the study, the island received a lot of rain, but then is suffered a severe drought, which drastically affected the availability of the seeds that the birds ate This provided a great opportunity to watch natural selection in action During the drought, the plants on the island produced many fewer of the small, soft varieties of seeds that the finches prefer The finches quickly ate most of the small, soft types of seeds This left mostly larger, harder seeds, which many of the birds found difficult to eat The drought made it obvious that Darwin's first postulate was being met: more birds were born than survived long enough to reporoduce The food shortage caused many birds to starve to death The finch population declined from 1200 birds to 180 birds in just two years of drought This was obviously a severe case, but not anything unusual in the real world The Grants' measurements showed that there was variation in the depth (height) of the finches beaks there was a normal, smooth distribution of beak depths, ranging from relatively shallow beaks to relatively deep ones and they observed that birds with different beak depths preferred different kinds of seeds birds with shallow beaks preferred smaller, softer seeds presumably because their beaks were not strong enough to break into the larger, harder seeds birds with deeper beaks preferred larger, harder seeds presumably because there were more of them around, and these birds were able to crack them with their stronger (deeper) beaks They might also have preferred the larger seeds because they have more food content per seed So, the variation in beak depth caused a variation in fitness when small seeds were scarce birds with shallow beaks had trouble finding enough food birds with deeper beaks were more likely to find enough food so birds with deeper beaks were more likely to survive during the drought That is, Darwin's second postulate was also being met: the birds varied in how well suited they were to find food during the drought This is illustrated by figure 1.9 in the text Fig 1.9a shows that the deeper the beak, the more likely the bird was to survive during the drought years Fig 1.9b shows the distribution of beak depths during the early, wet years, and the distribution of beak depths after a year of drought more of the birds with shallow beaks have died off, leaving a population with relatively more deep-beaked birds that is, the average beak depth increased Finally, the Grants compared the beak depths of birds and their offspring, and found that beak depth was inherited: Darwin's third postulate, that offspring tend to resemble their parents, was also working in nature They showed that shallow-beaked birds tended to produce shallow-beaked offspring, and deep-beaked birds tended to produce deep-beaked offspring This is no surprise, of course but it is absolutely necessary for the theory to work otherwise, the offspring would not reflect the traits that had been selected for in the parents So, after two years of drought, the new generation of finches being hatched had beaks that averaged deeper than the chicks of just two years earlier In two years, the average beak depth increased by 4% This is evolution caught in the act And not even the slow, gradual evolution we usually think of Imagine what would happen to human stature if selection caused it to increase this same 4% every two generations In twenty generations, the
