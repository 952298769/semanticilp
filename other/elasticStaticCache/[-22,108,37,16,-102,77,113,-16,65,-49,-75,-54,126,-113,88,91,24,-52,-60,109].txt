SMITH (1769-1839), in the course of working on canal excavations all over England, noticed that the same series of fossil assemblages could be found again and again-he was eventually able to predict both the order of fossil assemblages and the thickness of a given stratum at any locality before a hole was even dug-he could do this because he realized that the slabs of sedimentary rock were draped over he each other like a stack of really thick blankets on a badly made bed-each layer had a characteristic group of fossils in it that were found where ever that layer of rock was found-Smith had been in charge of digging a lot of holes and had traced each stratum laterally over great distances Smith, like most engineers, was not a philosopher and drew no grand conclusions from his work-it was simply a practical tool to use in canal and mine construction-he didn't care whether the fossils represented organic remains or were simply \"sports of nature\"-he had no interest in whether or not he was documenting the evolution of the earth, but other people looked at his work and realized that he was Smith invented STRATIGRAPHY without realizing its implications-we will get to this topic later in the semester-for now it is important to realized that Smith used FOSSILS to create an ORDINAL SYSTEM for organizing rocks-an ordinal system is one that imposes order by describing a unique series of events-anywhere you find any part of that unique series of events, you have found a part of that system-in this case the system was describing the series of events that is the history of the earth-the events are recognized by the groups of fossils that define them on a much shorter timescale think of the artifacts that characterize the post-war decades in US history-if you see black&amp;white TVs, cars with big tail fins, women wearing bobby sox and men wearing pompadours, you know you are within about 5 years of 1957-if you see lava lamps, leather jackets with long fringes, and eight track tapes, you know you are within 5 year of 1967-and so on-paleontologists do the same thing with fossils, except they have look at rocks and sediments instead of archive footage in libraries and boxes in attics this means that to understand the evolution of the earth, it would help if you could recognize some fossils-in order to keep all the fossils straight, it will help if you know how biota are classified EARLIEST FOSSIL EVIDENCE it is possible, in theory, that whole other kingdoms of biota existed, but we have found no fossil evidence as yet earliest fossils are of prokaryotic organisms in rocks ~3.5 billion years old-this is approximately a billion years after the earth \nis thought to have formed and is in the early part of what is called the ARCHEAN EON the cells of prokaryotes lack nuclei and the DNA is not arranged in chromosomes-modern representatives include the misnamed \"blue-green algae\" or CYANOBACTERIA-cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and produced much of the free oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for subsequent life forms-modern cyanobacteria look very similar to their fossilized ancestors preserved in rocks that are billions of years old cyanobacteria accumulate in mats in shallow saline waters and biomineralize calcite-the layer of bacteria smothers and a new layer forms over it, along with a new layer of calcite-the resulting structure is called a STROMATOLITE-they have been found in Archean rocks and they still grow today in a few isolated locations in western Australia, Belize, and the Bahamas LIFE GETS MORE COMPLICATED the first eukaryotes, cells with nuclei and chromosomes, appear in the fossil record at 1.4 billion years before present-this part of the geological time scale is called the PROTEROZOIC EON-there is good evidence that eukaryotes arose from symbiotic combinations of prokaryotic organisms-the presence of mitochondrial DNA distinct from cellular DNA was one of the earlier pieces of evidence toward this theory, which has been championed by Lynn Margulis since the 1970s-modern examples of single-celled eukaryotes include yeasts, many types of algae, protozoans like Amoeba and Paramecium and marine microplankton the oldest known eukaryotes are green algae-these fossils are found in rocks that may be as old as 2.0 Ba and are definitely at least 1.8 Ba-fossil prokaryotes are told from fossil eukaryotes based mostly on size-modern prokaryotes are rarely as large as 60 microns, while modern eukaryotes are typically more than 200 microns long-eurkaryotic organisms require AEROBIC conditions (free oxygen is present) to survive-these fossils tell us that earth's atmosphere had become aerobic by 2.0 Ba-by 1.25 Ba the first multicellular algae (seaweeds) had appeared in the fossil record the Bitter Springs Formation in central Australia was deposited 0.8-0.75 Ba-fossils of green algae occur in TETRADS in these rocks, which is consistent with MEIOTIC CELL DIVISION typical of eukaryotes and unknown in prokaryotes LIFE GETS MULTICELLULAR late Proterozoic trace fossils of burrows suggest the presence of primitive worms from nearly 700 Ma-the shapes of the burrows suggest that the organisms that made them were more rigid than a single-celled motile organism could be-even multicellular organisms without skeletons of any kind can make their bodies more rigid than the cell membrane of a single-celled organism EDIACARAN (or VENDIAN) FAUNA-in Ediacara Hills of Flinders Range in western Australia-670 Ma-soft-parts of about 30 different large multi-cellular animals are preserved as MOLDS-mixture of recognizable forms, like worms, and body plans that do not resemble any subsequent life forms-few of the Ediacaran fauna belong to familiar phyla-some workers believe that they may not be the ancestors of later metazoans, but an entire kingdom that did not survive the Proterozoic-however, the Ediacaran fauna does include undisputed Cnidaria, which do have modern relative, but are not ancestral to most metazoans For more on this topic see Ediacaran fauna a significant aspect of the Ediacaran fauna is that it made up of HETEROTROPHS-organisms that eat other organisms or detris for nutrition-all previous life forms had been AUTOTROPHIC and produced their own food through either photosynthesis or chemosythesis MULTICELLULARITY CATCHES ON by the end of the Proterozoic three of the five surviving kingdoms had evolved-the Monera, the Protoctista and the Animalia-the Cnidaria of the Ediacararan fauna are the first acoelomates-the first coelomates occur in the last 35 m.y. of the Proterozoic, an interval called the TOMMOTIAN-these animals are referred to as the SMALL SCALY FAUNA (or Tommotian fauna)-they are typically less than 2 mm and the 'shells' are composed of CALCIUM PHOSPHATE-few of these 'shells' appear to cover complete animals, but instead are pieces of more extensive armoring CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION in the lower Cambrian there a geologically sudden increase in the diversity of life preserved to the fossil record-representatives of two different kingdoms-the Protoctista and the Animalia-independently developed BIOMINERALIZATION-the manufacture of minerals by living organisms-while the organisms were alive, these biomineralized skeletons probably provided protection from predation and from the physical elements-after the organism died it provides geologists with a record of the organism's existence-the shells of many biota that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion were made of calcium phoshate-apparently the environment was very rich in phosphate at the time-later the most common biominerals became CALCIUM CARBONATE and SILICA SAMPLE PRODUCTS OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION kingdom PROTOCTISTA phylum SARCOMASTIGOPHORA foraminifera radiolaria kingdom ANIMALIA phylum PORIFERA sponges phylum ARCHEOCYATHA (Cambrian only) phylum ARTHROPODA (e.g., trilobites) phylum MOLLUSCA (e.g., clams, snails, nautiloids) phylum ECHINODERMATA (e.g., starfish, urchins, crinoids) the emergence of large 'shelly' metazoans and protists with mineral shells vastly increased the volume of the fossil record-exoskeletons were either AGGLUTINATED (pieces of sediment glued together) or SECRETED (biomineralized) trilobites appeared ~527 Ma and typically comprised more than 90% of the shelly fauna of the Cambrian period-inarticulate brachiopods comprised 5-7% and the other phyla make up the remainder-despite the dominance of the trilobites nearly all the other existing phyla (including the chordates) first appeared during the 30 m.y. that make up the Cambrian period THE BURGESS SHALE in addition to phyla that still exist, several phyla developed during the Cambrian (or the Proterozoic and existed until the Cambrian), but did not survive into the Ordovician period-we know this because of the discovery of LAGERSTATTEN in a few locations around the world-these deposits preserve fossilized remains of both the shelly hard-parts and outlines of the organic \nsoft parts of a fauna the Burgess Shale is located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia and is a middle Cambrian rock formation-when it was first discovered in the early 20th century by Charles Doolittle Walcott the fauna were shoe-horned into existing phyla because at the time paleontologists could not conceive of entire extinct phyla-in the 1960s and 70s the fossils were re-examined-the fossils that were entirely soft-bodied organisms were reassigned to newly erected phyla-the 'Burgess Shale fauna' has since been found in other middle Cambrian lagerstatten around the world, but not in any younger lagerstatten a large majority (98",1.0569041967391968],["solid inner core Mantle - most of earth - rock Crust - Oceanic Crust-- denser -
