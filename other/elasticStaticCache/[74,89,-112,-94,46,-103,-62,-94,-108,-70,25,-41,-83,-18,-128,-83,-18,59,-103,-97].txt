DRAFT April 10, 2014 101 it could worsen the effects of natural calamities like typhoons. Mountain without forest cover because of massive cutting of trees will result to deadly landslides and floods. These do not only lead to damage to property but result in the loss of human lives as well. 1.What are the things that humans do that harm animals and plants? Humans cut trees indiscriminately. This destroy the homes of a lot of animals that live in trees. They also capture animals in the wild and keep in them in cages as pets. Humans let dirty water from their houses and factories to flow into rivers and lakes. Humans also throw their garbage anywhere like in rivers that could pollute the water and kill fishes and other aquatic animals. Humans also do let the dirty exhaust from their vehicles to pollute the air. 2.What will happen if we continue to cut a lot of trees. The continuous cutting of trees will result to the displacement of animals living in these trees. It could also result to the disappearance of a lot of animal and plant species that depend on trees. Moreover, the absence of trees in mountainous areas results to landslides and floods because of the absence of the roots of trees that absorbs water and help in maintaining the solidity of the soil. 3.What will happen if we will not take care of the air we breathe? The breathing of polluted air could result to diseases in humans like asthma, allergy and other diseases of the lungs.
