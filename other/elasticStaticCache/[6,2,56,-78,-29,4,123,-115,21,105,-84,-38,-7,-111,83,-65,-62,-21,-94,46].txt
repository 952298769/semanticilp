[["The most fascinating thing about the mimic octopus is its ability to impersonate other animals. The environment that this octopus lives in is plain and therefore provides difficult conditions for the octopus to hide from predators. Instead of hiding, the octopus uses mimicry to defend itself from predators. While many octopi are known to change colors in order to camouflage themselves, none have been known to copy the behavior of other animals. [14] This octopus is involved in active mimicry, meaning that the animal changes its behavior to match that of a species distasteful to predators. [15] In this case, the mimic octopus changes its behavior to match that of predatorial animals. By doing so, the octopus appears to be a threat to its own predators. This defense mechanism is even more amazing, because the octopus can adapt its form to suit the perceived threat. For example, the mimic will behave as a sea snake to intimidate the damselfish whose predator is the sea snake.",2.079893112182617],["The octopus's primary defense is to hide or to disguise itself through camouflage and mimicry .
