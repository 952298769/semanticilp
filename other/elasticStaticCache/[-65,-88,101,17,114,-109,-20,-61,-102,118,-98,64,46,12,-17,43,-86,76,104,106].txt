[["Since northeastern Iowa has received more rain than other parts of the state, we can anticipate more disease in that area.",0.7920565009117126],["There are two interns in the state of Nebraska that helped out Sidney and getting these pilot projects in the state of Nebraska actually established one was Camey Post who was out in the Western panhandle part of the state of Nebraska and then the bluff area and I was in the Carney area which is the south central part of the state I am a senior out at the University of Nebraska at Carney and am majoring in aggor-business and communications and Sidney originally approached me this last Christmas break when I was working out at the Department of Agriculture on Christmas vacation and so she asked me to accept this job as a intern and my primary goal was to see if we could get one established in the Carney area and simply do this by going out in the Carney community and talking to organizations and service clubs and establishing what were doing why were doing it and how were doing it and by using that three step process we were actually able to form a group and so I accepted the position and without knowing anything about health insurance and I ve uh its been a learning process no doubt I ve talked to my advisor and I got some college course credit for it as well but um our story was a success and I worked on it for about 4 months and primarily I did this by first of all determining who were the key players in the Carney area and so the Carney chamber of Commerce was a key part in helping this actually get established in telling me who I should talk to and who do I need to that has pulling power in the Carney area that can actually and reach the community and reach the public and tell them and actually invite individuals who are in the individual health insurance market who are underinsured or are uninsured and actually bring them into the group and give them an opportunity and help them out as far as health insurance goes so I talked to about a dozen different organizations and I always enjoyed public speaking in high school and I decided to pursue it as one of my majors but I found out the true challenge is actually answering the questions and so I would uh, occasionally I would deliver a co presentation with Sindey and she would just nail off the answers right away and so um before I give a presentation I would just study and study and study and so when I would go to the group and they would actually ask the questions the first thing I would say was I ll be honest with you I am an intern I am just learning about health insurance but I ll do the best I can to answer your questions but what I found what many of the questions were similar and because the questions were similar I made the assumption that everyone has the same types of problems um you know with the health insurance premiums increasing by 90% with 33% of the nations people in agriculture underinsured obviously this was a high problem after talking to the organizations I made personal phone calls contacting people who were interested telling them when we were going to have our group presentation and actually talk about this group and see if they would actually want to become a part of the group I contacted the media which was the key part in this process talking to agricultural radio stations as well as out in the western panhandle they did interviews with TV and newspaper articles were also crucial and it was actually the media and the political champions who actually made the people respond to make the people call back to my dorm room and I de come back with about 10 different messages and they would say there s something about the health insurance and to help out people in individual insurance market can you give me some answers can you tell me what this is actually about and so as time progressed there is in fact some individuals who said that we weren t going to \nbe successful they admired our courage in going into this but they frankly told me on the phone this is not going to work for you and they said its not going to work out um and so I keep telling Sindey we have got to call these people back and say it did work we were successful and so um that was the greatest part of the satisfaction was knowing that it actually did work and again it was because of the pulling power of the people int he Carney area talking with people talking with people in the Good Samaritan Hospital the Executive Director he told me he said you know if you re going to provide insurance to individual insurance people this is the way to go contact the actual public and for a purchasing cooperative he said this is the best way to go about it again with their support of these people as well as the political players the key part was starting low int he Carney area and moving up to the state wide area and with that why then I ll put up the first overhead so in April we had about 70 people that showed up we simply gave them he presentation and told them about it and then on June 9 we gave a presentation in Carney of the people who actually said they wanted to become a part of the group and this time there were um approximately 100 people at that area in the group who said that their interested so at this first meeting we said we adopted by laws and the constitution simply stating the organization was formed and that s its established and this is our orders that this group will abide by we elected a board of trustees who were kind of like the cabinet and actually the people who will make sure that they keep on top of things and be responsible for contacting the third party administrator we defined the time frame and the goals as to when the group will actually propose for a bid and this time frame is actually set for September which is actually ahead of schedule what we originally intended and we set our goals as to what we wanted to achieve by each separate meeting and finally the requests for proposal and the contact for the insurance expert or the third party administrator who can go out in the individual health insurance market and bring back to the group these different insurance plans that the group can choose from and the results as I stated there were two sites one from the Carney area and 200 to 250 members in each group only after 2 meetings and so again the media contacts the pulling power in these two areas are key and we gave a multiplier factor of .8 and basically teats stating for every one member in the group they will influence 2.8 people and so by as time increased we would expect these groups to be at 560 to 700 members which is obviously stating that there is a need and these people do need some type of health insurance and this is the way to go about it as far as the future is concerned I am very optimistic and I think you had to be optimistic about this at the very beginning I know Sindey was and its because of her expertise and actually looking at the Kennedy Kassabam law and determining what it was that this law can provide to Nebraska and actually pursuing this project Nebraska was successful in these projects and there s articles to actually show it and there are several different articles this was in the Carney Hub one week end additionally here are other articles and I believe that this was successful in Nebraska and we hope it can become a multi state model not only for our nation but hopefully for other countries as well who says that Nebraska or who says that this nation is the only country that needs these types of insurance groups we believe this is something that can become a global issue the economy is becoming more global I think this is something that was addressed in our state but in other states as well there aren t only local newspapers and organizations but there are state wide newspapers and magazine that actually address this issue in fact regional magazines too in fact I think Successful Farmer did one then they said a regional magazine in the mid west that addressed these problems It was in the Omaha World Herald which in some cases reaches into Iowa as well and so although these articles that contacted the people as the people champion Governor Ben Nelson is a Governor I was telling Sindey before I said we started low in the Carney area and the Bluff area talking to the individual organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and we simply moved up the line and as we moved up the line up into the Insurance Commissioner as well as the Governor it attracted the media in addition to the media we ve already contacted and this actually got spread out to the group with these types of endorsements such as the media and such as these political players this was key role to our success the most frequently asked questions are what is the cost what are the tax benefits and when can people actually join.",0.7419198155403137],["The mountain areas

this a worthwhile learning experience determine how students will acquire necessary skills look at amount of Internet time available, other methods for getting information 4 - Research Other Projects look at examples of other on-line projects examine timelines, number of classes involved, etc. investigate suggested sites for reference in the ENO conferences 5 - Outline the Details of the Project for email activities, consider the following guidelines contact person&#146;s information (name, school, email, school address and phone) project title educational purpose (be as descriptive as possible) curriculum links (list as many as are relevant) grade levels number of schools (classes) to be involved summary of project including specific timelines (more details can be sent to participating schools after they register) registration details sharing of information at conclusion of project 6 - Invite Others to Participate create your own &quot;Call for Participation&quot; file to be used by other participants based on the details of the project consider posting information in related conferences within ENO to reach a wide Ontario audience use the services of a listserv to involve classes in other parts of the world try out your project with a few colleagues to iron out any problems before you actually start with students 7 - Form the Project Group as soon as people respond to your call, send them a reply acknowledging their request for participation send a more detailed outline of the project that includes specific timelines and registration procedures TIP - when requesting registrations, ask potential participants to be as specific as possible about their intentions to participate some teachers agree to participate and then don&#146;t get as involved as required for the project to be successful keep track of the replies and registration details in a special file or folder if you have enough classes before the registration date closes, be sure to respond to all requests stating that the project is full keep their names on file if you pan on doing the project again 8 - Start the Project stick to the timelines as indicated don&#146;t worry if the students have more background than you - work along side of them don&#146;t get frustrated if you don&#146;t get the responses from others that you were hoping for - it takes time to build some projects 9 - Bring Closure to the Project participants need to have a closing event or activity to finish the project make sure you let participants know of specific timeframes well in advance build in an evaluation component to the project 10 - Share the Results include a method for posting the results of the project people need to feel that their input was valued find a way to share results

unattainable rises Only bringing me deeper into hell There is nothing I would not give Just to be with her If only for a little while Part of her life Raising me from my misery She is my wish upon a star Holding the key to my soul My resurrection if you will Reviving my heart Willing it to beat once more After the dream is over A harsh reality shatters my world Ripping me from a perfect life Throwing me back to my aguish Careless as to what the consequences are to me Realizing my life is not with her Hurls me deeper into the hole Further than before the dream Cast into the blackness of myself Growing more dark with every drop of reality She is my rope ladder A way to climb out of my bottomless existence Without her I am always falling Plummeting deeper for eternity I need her to stop my descent A tear wets my dark soul Like the thunderstorm during the night Darkness rules my world Pain is the only feeling I know My soul cries for the end With tears of rain My mind weeps of sadness Wishing it all to end Wanting to be done with it The only desire of mine My world is filled with darkness The shadows of death All else is useless to me My demise is morphine to my soul To feel no more pain would be heaven Nothing in my life is good The thunder lightning and black clouds All of it is rancid Everything has gone bad My life is worthless to me The storm will never end I know this to be true Trapped in the cold rain Nothing to shelter me from the storm Left to die Now a solemn tear drips my eye Letting time have its way with me Awaiting the end of my time All I can do is wait patiently For my time to meet the reaper If you want to find me Look to the rain I'll be trapped outside Waiting for my demise To complete my existence of misery My life is black Surrounded by rain With nothing except my despair The only feeling i still have That and the hatred of this life An empty voice rings from the other side Floating through my mind like the kiss of an angel on my empty soul It echos through a heart yearning for your reality Each echo washing all away but my desire for you With every wave my love grows deeper Only able to hear the voice Images of you torment my mind A hungry heart surviving by smelling the food My hunger for you multiplies Soon I will fast or die Days drift by with torturous monotony Time slows down in your memory Bringing hours of excruciating lonliness Every day more salt in the wound from leaving you Time can only add to my sadness The sun refuses to rise for me An eternal night shadows my heart Kept in the darkness of solitude Pictures and phone-calls my candle Barely able to see my way Relentlessly the rain comes Forever pounding on my soul since I left Tears from my soul fall for her I am trapped in the downpour It can rain all the time In an odd new world She is my compass here I have left her behind Lost without her at my side I need the direction she provides Without the keeper of my sanity Time slowly corrodes my mental state Every day leaves less than the one before it My patience without you wears thin I'm dying without you To J.A.Y.

only knew what a pussy you are&quot; and we both screamed and laughed ... bill was not a fraud because he did do as I said many would imagine ...nor was he a pussy or a coward ..he was a gentle man brought up by good parents who could not stand to think that someone felt he was a liar or dealing falsely with them and so he just bought another cartridge and moved on ... just as he never made a stink about his some of his material ending up in denis leary's &quot;little skitshow&quot; ... many would have sued and made a &quot;name&quot; and a stink and found a way to &quot;promote&quot; themselves ... he just joked privately that leary had been invited to bill's parents' house for thanksgiving instead of bill this year&quot; and moved on ... and since i brought up that word &quot;sacred&quot; ... so much about bill has that word attached to it ...not just that my memory of him is sacred in my life but the way he treated people and the truth ... he was the kindest most compassionate loyal soul i have ever known ... were he a woman i would have married him in a heartbeat but i was not robbed of anything because he was born a man ...i simply knew him on another level which one should hopefully know their spouse and partner on ... as friend and best friend and that was more than enough (and no i am not gay though i am sure if i were i would find men as big a mystery and a necessary nuisance as i do women ... i just do not have the time nor the emotional patience to be bi ) ... my god ... bill was and is bigger than life and he is certainly bigger than death and that is why this day does not toll heavily in my heart ... it simply reminds me how long it has been since i have gotten to talk with bill on the phone or play nintendo together or laugh over dinner ... but even at the loss of these daily events in the present ... at this moment i am smiling and so happy ... because in knowing bill i had a friend who was so loyal that if some woman hurt me he would say &quot;she is cut from the team&quot; and trust me were there a reconciliation it was very hard to get them back in bill's good favor because he took the hearts and feelings of his friends so personally and treated them so protectively ... and in my years of touring and doing one nighters with comics from all over and watching married comics &quot;slip off the ring&quot; bill had the ability or rather the absolute single minded compulsion to be loyal if he were involved no matter how he was being treated on the other end ... any woman who was lucky enough to know him that way knew the soul of a poet and had a devoted friend ... jesus i am reading all this i wrote here and i may very well throw up ... this sounds like a goddamned hallmark card and like i am eulogizing some eagle scout and somehow &quot;dressing up his memory&quot; in death .... that is not the case ... bill was and is that good ... when i spoke at his memorial service i looked out at devoted friends and family and friends and remarked ... &quot;seeing this adoration for him reminds me of how religions get started&quot; ... when i was going through my separation and divorce i did not mind it at all because bill was there every step of the way ...not guiding and counseling but instead coming up with impromptu tirades and little plays involving my ex wife and her current love and their potential offspring which bill would translate into hours of the most hysterical healing laughter as he would do this little show nightly on the phone with me called &quot;i love Lucifer&quot; \nwhich he would begin with the theme song to &quot;i love Lucy&quot; followed by the sound of a doorbell &quot;ding dong&quot; then each episode would be about some unsuspecting guest entering the home of my ex and her lover and their offspring ...the parents would be out and the &quot;dark one&quot; was always for some unknown reason locked in a room pleading so sweetly and gently for someone to let &quot;it&quot; out (reminding me of an old twiglight zone with the devil locked in the basement) and each episode would end with this guest (from the paperboy to the landlord to a grandparent) unlocking that door to release this poor child followed by shrieks of &quot;oh sweet jesus&quot; and growls ...chomping ... screams ... and silence ... closing it out with the theme song again .... he had a very cinematic narrative style ... these were truly some of the funniest things i have ever heard but more importantly they were the best medicine for a heart that badly needed healing and he gave that so willingly and freely hours on end ... and in the days before online we would talk on the phone while powering up our Nintendos in synch and furiously playing Zelda and others at the same time as we swore at the makers of the software ... when i fell &quot;in love&quot; once ... bill went into his bathroom (still living in new york then) and used an 8 track (not that kind) tape recorder he bought from will lee (letterman's band's bassist) and because the acoustics were nice in there he would record music on his guitar and sing along ... after hours of recording and mixing he sent a tape for the girl i fell for so she could listen to it while i was out of town and think of me and my love ... it was the most beautiful romantic sweet heartfelt music ... which has found it's way instrumentally onto his newer CDs thanks to kevin booth ... he did these things because he wanted his friends to know how much he loved and regarded them ... we would repeat lines from butch cassidy and one really applies to bill (or willie as he wanted to be called but i just couldn't because it sounded so gay ...please no mail regarding this) the line is &quot;i've got vision and the rest of the world wears bifocals&quot; and when bill got too full of himself i would say &quot;you just keep thinking there butch ...that's what you are good at&quot; and he would laugh at himself immediately ... he was always the first to do that ... and when i broke up with that girl...besides applying the same brutally right on the money perceptions and humor he had used in the routines that got me through my divorce he also happened to at least call 6 or 8 times a day to make absolutely sure i was &quot;ok&quot;....sorry folks ...he was just simply a nice guy ... his mother will tell you the same and people will just think &quot;well that is just the blindness of parental love&quot; ... nope ... he was just that nice and she got it as to who bill was and delighted in her boy and rightly so ... and for all of those who delight in your belief he hated children ...sorry ... he doted on his nephew and niece (steve's kids who is also a great guy ...this family is ridiculously great including mr and mrs hicks who i cannot bring myself to call jim and mary because of my upbringing) he would give the children the most wonderful gifts like books he had read as a child and other things that showed both love and proved he was simply a terrific uncle who wanted them to be happy and imaginative he would have been such a great dad ... as with sam kinison who i introduced my wife to after a show once and sam and i hugged and he turned to my wife and genuinely meant it when he said &quot;i hope it was not too vulgar&quot; ... and for those who delighted in bill's observations and assumed he was so on the money in his perceptions that he would not hesitate to be cruel ... well ... judge for yourselves ... i remember when carrot top called bill and asked why he hated him ...now for those of you waiting for a really &quot;acerbic put them in their place&quot; punchline ... there was none ...instead bill explained his disdain for certain approaches to comedy and in what was so typically bill they met and ended up taking pictures ...one of carrot top showing bill a prop and one of bill showing carrot top a notebook and a pen ... both men showed great humor and a lot of class that day as far as i am concerned ... and that is what bill was all about ultimately ...healing ...not tearing something or someone down but building them up and making it all better than it was before he had come into contact with them ... another story ... and this is so obscure and strangely beautiful and touching i hope the point is not lost it was such a small and gentle act ... the bible speaks of letting your gifts be in secret so as to not be glorifying oneself in the eyes of others ... we have a mutual friend who had a brother with schizophrenia and was ( i hear he has passed away ...sorry i did not say i am sorry ...you know who you are ...your brother was a treat and thanks for introducing us...sorry i had to say that to someone who i know will be reading this) a really delightful individual ... well when bill and i were in england he bought a box of very expensive cigars (i noticed this ..he would \nnot make that point ever) and brought them back to the states as a gift for this man i just spoke of ... well ... i understand instead of lighting up and puffing away this man furiously unrolled one of these cigars over the toilet and emptied it out into the stool and flushed it in glee and bill ... instead of being horrified at how his expensive gift was being misused he was totally delighted that his gift was being enjoyed so immensely and was supremely happy about it...that is how generous bill was ... so .... even though i SAY i do not miss him i do miss not having any new stories ... the night after his memorial i had to do a gig and after getting through it i went back to the room and out of habit looked at the phone to see if the message light was flashing as it always had been every night for years before and whenever i would call the desk there would be a message &quot;bill called&quot; or &quot;butch called&quot; or &quot;call buddy love&quot; ... i remember onetime when i was working is such a small town the motel closed their switchboard after 11 ..well this would not do for bill..that is when we about the time nightly we began to talk and enjoy the fullness of an evening so when the desk said &quot;we cannot

noise of time i suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably

communities, speak the language, and have community leadership approval there is a need for people to be clear why they think research is needed and to have an aim in mind to avoid aimless collecting of data there is the possibility of various groups duplicating research and the same survivors being repeatedly approached to no personal benefit, if researching groups fail to liaise if research is to be used to lobby, for example for compensation or regional development, then research design must take into account what would be useful information to gather to this end there are many possible research areas or issues which need clarification over time, and there is a need to accept that this will take more than one research initiative: the impulse to do too much in one go could be counter-productive there is therefore a need to identify what is manageable in the short term before more complicated designs trying to link, for example, community apathy to torture and also to under development, are attempted any research instrument must strike a balance between information which is purely quantitative, and the collecting of opinions/ideas from the community, and this is makes design important there is the danger of raising unfulfillable hopes in people, if the research agenda is not kept very clear Possible research issues identified: there is a need to further clarify the history of Matabeleland, for its own sake and for the record: depending on the organisation doing the research and their agendas, this history could relate only to the 1980s, or to a longer time period taking in the War of Liberation there is a need to produce reconciliation in the region, and if research could be directed to this end in any way, it should be done there is a need to acknowledge that something happened and for people both within and without the region to know the history is being written research could try and establish ways forward for development the process of story telling could provide a cathartic outlet to turn bitterness to productive energy research could establish the will of the community with respect to mass graves the process of being involved in research could instil confidence in affected people, allow a sense of identity and reconnect people to their pasts, by breaking the barrier of fear Solutions: organisations involved in research should form links to avoid \nduplication the organisations with the best local community network and support should conduct research in a given area, and this will vary depending on the precise region where research is occurring a joint human rights fact sheet should be devised and used by all groups: this will ensure compatibility of basic data between organisations, should it be agreed in the future that some data should be shared across the board, for example to facilitate writing a history research should not take place without researchers being aware of the responsibilities contingent on retraumatising people by encouraging them to relive their stories: how to offer emotional support should be considered transparency, permission from clients and confidentiality to be key ethical
