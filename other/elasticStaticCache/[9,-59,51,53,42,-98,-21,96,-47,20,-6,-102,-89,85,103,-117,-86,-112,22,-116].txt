Empires, has really gotten people talking... Age of Empires II Although the gist of Age of Empires II is basically the same as its predecessor, it feels like a whole new game... Black &amp; White Black & White is more of a strategy game than it is anything else, but it is so different from any other strategy game that it nearly defies categorization... Age of Empires: The Conquerors Expansion ...if you were to go to the store and actually buy an add-on, The Conquerors - and expansion set for Age of Empires II - would be a solid choice... Starcraft: Brood War Should you find yourself wanting more out of Starcraft, you will definitely want to consider the Brood War expansion... Caesar III Caesar II fans will probably find that there is not a tremendous improvement between this game and the previous Caesar game other \nthan new graphics and cutscenes... Civilization: Call to Power This is a good game and it's a true Civilization through and through... Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun -- Firestorm Firestorm is almost laughable, which must be rather disappointing for Tiberian Sun fans because the game has evolved into something that barely resembles the original Command & Conquer Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty \"The Dirty Half Dozen are back,\" although Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty is neither a sequel nor an add-on... Deadlock 2 There aren't many entertainment developers anymore who build turn-based games, as opposed to the latest craze of real-time strategy games... Dominion: Storm over Gift 3 Having seen Dominion in its early stages at 7th Level approximately two years ago, we knew the game showed a great deal of promise... Dune 2000 As it stands, Dune 2000 is a good game, but not a great game and it still needs to have a few bugs ironed out... Dungeon Keeper 2 It's the type of game that a player can sit down to for just a few minutes, but can become absolutely absorbed in just because it's not something that he or she has seen before... Myst III: Exile Myst III captures the best elements of its predecessors, including the intrigue, the fragility, and the beauty of the games' islands... Railroad Tycoon II It seems to me that if there were more games like Railroad Tycoon II the world would be a happier place... Red Alert II Westwood Studios seems to have pulled out of their downward tailspin with their latest - and possibly greatest - strategy game in years: Red Alert II...
