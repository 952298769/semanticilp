[["Animals adapt to many different things and for many different reasons. They mostly adapt to the environment or they adapt physically. Animals can also adapt to different en…vironments by natural selection, a process in which only the strongest animals can survive. Then, those who have survived can mate. This helps them adapt. EDIT: They would also adapt by having thick fur if they live in the arctic or having something to live without water for a longtime if they live in the desert. They adapt to their environment with different characteristics like how the dog gets his winter coat in the wintertime and sheds the winter coat in summertime. The adaptations to a environment from an animal are not learned behaviors but they are inherited traits. -Chey Hansen Snohomish Wa",1.7858879566192627],["During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers;",1.3123326301574707],["Fur and feathers help keep some animals warm during the harsh winter.",1.2972277402877808],["Fur and feathers help keep some animals warm during the harsh winter.",1.2972277402877808],["Fur and feathers help keep some animals warm during the harsh winter.",1.2972277402877808],["Fur and feathers help keep some animals warm during the harsh winter.",1.2972277402877808],["[17] During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male.",1.2860937118530273],["[22] During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male.",1.2860937118530273],["I would like to share with you some of the tips that have helped my birds' skin and feathers stay healthy during the inevitable harsh winter months.",1.1165207624435425],["I would like to share with you some of the tips that have helped my birds' skin and feathers stay healthy during the inevitable harsh winter months.",1.1165207624435425],["How do feathers help its animal survive?",1.0743054151535034],["To shed or cast the hair, feathers, skin, horns, or the like, as an animal or a bird.",1.0050476789474487],["To shed or cast the hair, feathers, skin, horns, or the like, as an animal or a bird.",1.0050476789474487],["Shedding in housed animals is subject to seasonal effects, most noticeably a drop in shedding during the Winter (p=0.051), followed by an increase in the subsequent Spring (p=0.045).",1.002663493156433],["A species’ camouflage depends on several factors.

When the feather is first emerging and developing it has a blood supply coming from the body going up into the shaft of the feather. If this feather is broken or pulled out it is not only very painful for the bird, but could result in blood loss and damage to the feather follicle. Severe damage to the feather follicle could result in the permanent loss of the follicle. If a feather is lost before a molt it could take up to a year to be replaced.
