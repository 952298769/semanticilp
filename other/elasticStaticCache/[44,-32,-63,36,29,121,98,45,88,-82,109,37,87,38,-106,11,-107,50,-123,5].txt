(from north to south) Glacial Erosion--many fjords and islands with hard bedrock (coast of Maine) Glacial Deposition--peninsulas and islands made of glacial till (Cape Cod) Estuaries--drowned river valleys cut by glacial runoff (Chesapeake bay) Barrier islands &amp; lagoons--stable coasts south of glacially-effected areas Mangrove swamps--lagoons warm enough to support mangrove trees Features of Barrier Island/Lagoon Sequences Brackish water--sea water diluted by river runoff, lower than normal salinity Tidal channels--cuts through barrier islands with flood and ebb tide deltas Salt marshes--quiet coastal marshes with high biologic productivity Coral Reefs : complex shallow water communities supported by a framework Require warm water, strong sunlight, a hard substrate, no sediment input 1) Fringing reefs--initial reefs attached directly to volcanic oceanic island 2) Barrier reefs--reefs separated from an island by a lagoon due to subsidence 3) Atolls--isolated rings of reef from which a former island has submerged Chapter 16: Earth Resources Renewable Resources--part of geologic cycles, in ever-existing supply Non-renewable Resources--available in limited quantities, non-regenerating Water (Renewable) Renewable resource but in a limited supply in desert areas Resource can be destroyed by pollution and salt water incursion Desalination or other processing sometimes necessary to make water useful Raw Materials (Non-renewable) Geologic Concentration Processes: Hydrothermal precipitation--Copper, gold, lead, galena, sphalerite Igneous cooling--feldspar, quartz, lithium, diamonds (from pegmatites) Metamorphism--garnet, talc Evaporation--salt, gypsum, borax Soil leaching--aluminum (from bauxite) Placer sorting--gold, silver, platinum, diamonds Precambrian anoxic environments--iron (from Banded Iron Formations) Metallic vs. Non-metallic resources Underground mining vs. strip mining of ore Some uses of Earth Resources: Building/road materials: quarried rock, gravel, sand, limestone, gypsum Metals: gold, silver, platinum, copper, iron, lead, aluminum, zinc, etc. Abrasives: diamonds, corundum, diatomite Ceramics: clay minerals Fuel: coal, petroleum, natural gas, coal, uranium Gemstones: diamond, corundum, beryl, garnet, topaz, zircon, etc. Energy Resources Non-renewable Fossil fuels (85% of current energy use) Coal--compressed &amp; altered plant remains, must be mined Petroleum &amp; natural gas--kerogen migrates upward into traps Oil shale &amp; tar sands--potentially minable petroleum Nuclear energy (8%)--Uranium is mined for use as nuclear fuel Renewable Hydroelectric power (5%)--electric generation from dammed rivers Geothermal energy (1%)--heat energy from hot spots in earth's crust Biomass energy--burning of food waste, garbage, ethanol, etc. Solar energy--useful for direct heating or electric generation Wind energy--useful in areas with continuous strong winds Tidal, wave, current, &amp; ocean thermal energy--ocean resources Timothy H.
