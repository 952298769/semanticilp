As you stand upon the Earth, you experience this force. We have become accustomed to calling it the force of gravity and have even represented it by the symbol Fgrav. Most students of physics progress at least to this level of sophistication concerning the notion of gravity. This same force of gravity acts upon our bodies as we jump upwards from the Earth. As we rise upwards after our jump, the force of gravity slows us down. And as we fall back to Earth after reaching the peak of our motion, the force of gravity speeds us up. In this sense, the force gravity causes an acceleration of our bodies during this brief trip away from the earth's surface and back. In fact, many students of physics have become accustomed to referring to the actual acceleration of such an object as the acceleration of gravity. Not to be confused with the force of gravity (Fgrav), the acceleration of gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object when the only force acting upon it is the force of gravity. On and near Earth's surface, the value for the acceleration of gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s/s. It is the same acceleration value for all objects, regardless of their mass (and assuming that the only significant force is gravity).

Water falls to the Earth in the water cycle, and gravity pulls the water (or ice) down hill, carrying sediment with it (erosion). As the speed of the water slows as the slope decreases, the larger and larger pieces of sediment are settled out of the water by the force of gravity, becoming deposited someplace else. If there is no water present, sediment can be transported by any other fluid as well, usually air in the form of wind. As the wind slows, gravity is again the main factor in deposition.
