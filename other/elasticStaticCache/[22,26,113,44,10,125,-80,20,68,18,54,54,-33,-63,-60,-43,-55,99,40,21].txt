adaptive change (improving the \"fit\" between organisms and their environments) The theory of natural selection is based on a series of observations and a conclusion based on those observations: observation 1: organisms vary no two living things (even \"identical twins\") are exactly alike Darwin wasn't sure why this is - we now know it's because of mutation and the shuffling of genes that occurs during sexual reproduction (crossing over, random assortment) observation 2: variation is heritable although some variation is due to differences in environment, many of the differences among individuals are due to genetic differences because genes are passed from parent to offspring, offspring resemble parents \nobservation 3: all organisms face a \"struggle for existence\" , which takes several forms overproduction : more individuals are born in every generation than the environment can support this means that most individuals die before they manage to reproduce the consequence of this is competition among individuals of the same species for access to the resources necessary to survive and reproduce interactions with other species : most organisms are subject to one or more of the \"3 p's\": predation, parasitism, pathogens also, different species may compete for access to similar resources interactions with the abiotic environment Darwin was very explicit in explaining that the \"struggle for existence\" could also be a metaphorical struggle, as, e.g., a plant \"struggling\" against dry soils observation #4: fitness varies among individuals note definition: fitness = relative ability to survive and reproduce no two organisms are exactly alike because of their underlying genetic differences, some individuals will be better able to survive the \"struggle for existence\" than others e.g., one seed may germinate a bit earlier, gaining access to light, space, water, soil nutrients before others of the same species e.g., one mouse might have slightly better hearing, making it better able to avoid predators e.g., one insect's immune system may make it slightly more resistant to a disease or parasite than another, allowing it to live longer e.g., one fish may be able to tolerate slightly more acidic water, allowing it to live in an environment with no competitors conclusion : what will inevitably occur if a-d are true (and they are for the vast majority of populations) is that adaptive traits will become more frequent in the population over time the organisms with the adaptive traits are surviving and reproducing better than others in the population because their adaptive traits are heritable, those traits will be passed on to their offspring because they have more offspring than others, their traits will be more frequent in subsequent generations as long as the environment stays the same, the same traits will continue to be favored, and will become increasingly common Another way to think about natural selection: see schematic at end of notes Note that there's nothing \"magic\" about selection: as long as the first four conditions are met, selection will happen Example of natural selection: the evolution of DDT resistance in mosquitoes prior to the development of DDT, some mosquitoes had an allele of a gene that could break down DDT and render it harmless - the allele was just a random mutation of a gene for an enzyme mosquitoes with that allele also had somewhat lower reproductive rates because there was no DDT in the enviroment, these mosquitoes got no advantage from the mutation consequently, they were selected against and the allele was maintained at only very low frequency in the environment When DDT was introduced into the environment, the individuals with that allele were selectively favored they survived and reproduced at a much higher rate than the mosquitoes without the allele they left more offspring - and those offspring inherited the allele the result was the increase in the frequency of the DDT-resistant allele (or, put another way, the \"spread\" of the allele throughout the population) Note a couple of important points about this example: the allele in question was already present in the population - the addition of DDT didn't cause the allele to arise this illustrates the general point that selection acts only on pre-existing variation - it does not create adaptive variation note that the allele itself isn't \"perfect\" - natural selection doesn't \"create perfect adaptation\", it simply selects the best alleles available in a given place at a given time the allele in question was actually selected against in one set of environmental circumstances, but favored in another because all environments change over time, traits that may have been disadvantageous at one time may become favored at another, and vice-versa selection never \"ends\" [ top ] [ Lectures ] [ 109N Home ] [ Dr.",0.906489372253418],["Herbicide resistance is a result of natural selection for

selection acts primarily on the one sex that is competing for the other as we have seen, because of pregnancy and lactation, mammal females can have only a limited number of offspring, but males have no such limitations females can generally only conceive when they aren't pregnant or lactating, and even then only during a limited portion of their cycle males can mate any time so there are generally plenty of males around to mate when a female needs to but the males have to compete for access to those limited chances to father offspring so selection will favor any feature of the males that increases their success at mating with receptive females we tend to think of survival to adulthood as being the biggest factor in natural selection, hence the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" but in fact, sexual selection can exert a much stronger evolutionary effect than selection based on different rates of survival males who do not succeed at mating frequently may produce absolutely no offspring this means absolutely none of their genes go into the next generation -- very severe selection from an evolutionary point of view, leaving no offspring is equivalent to dying in infancy this is a common occurrence meanwhile, males who mate often may produce many, many offspring very rapidly increasing the representation of their traits in the next generation being successful at mating and having a large number of offspring has a far greater effect that just surviving and having an average number of offspring example: imagine a species in which 80% of the males produce no offspring, and the remaining 20% father the entire next generation these are realistic figures for many animals, from lions to baboons the effect of this difference in just one generation would be equivalent to a drought that killed off 8 out of 10 individuals that is, ordinary, common degrees of selection on sexual success have as much effect on the next generation as the most drastic, rare extremes of selection that affect survival the same is true even if many males leave just a few offspring, while a few males leave large numbers of offspring the contribution to the next generation by the father of 12 is bigger than that of ten fathers of one child each... so the traits that lead males to have many children are strongly selected for Point: the process that has the strongest, most consistent effect on evolution is not \"survival of the fittest\", but \"mating of the sexiest\" because sexual selection is so strong, it can favor traits that have significant costs for survival even if fewer of the individuals who have the trait survive, they produce so many more offspring than those without it that the trait is favored anyway classic example of sexual selection: peacock tails (on males) the showier the tail, the more successful the male is at mating the tails have gotten so big that they make it hard for the males to hide or get away from predators but the benefit in terms of success in mating outweighs the cost to survival intrasexual selection (male-male competition) in primates males try to keep other males away from females this ensures that they are the likely fathers of any offspring this results in hostile encounters or fights so sexual selection favors large body size, large canines, possibly other traits that help one male defeat another for access to females but females would not benefit as much from larger body size, canines, etc. they would just have to eat even more to maintain a large body when food is already their limiting factor in reproductive success since selection favors larger males but smaller females, eventually sexual dimorphism arises differences between males and females sure enough, those species with the greatest male-male competition have the greatest sexual dimorphism male-male competition is assumed to be greatest in species whose social groups have the greatest imbalance of females to males because if there are relatively few males in the group, mating with the many females, then there must be lots of males excluded from the group who are not mating at all these bachelor males must be constantly driven away by the few males in the group the evidence: in monogamous species there is very little male-male competition, since each male is paired with one female and indeed, monogamous species have almost no sexual

most common, or not as long as more individuals are born than survive and reproduce, selection is always going on Boyd and Silk point out that stasis (staying the same) is no more &quot;natural&quot;

are common, what traits are rare, what is the average of traits like beak depth this distribution of traits many change over time, if directional selection occurs, or may remain constant, if

nest sites, distribution of potential mates Mate choice first observed by Darwin fig 55.8 Female`s evaluate male`s quality, decide whether or not to mate Superior mates should leave more offspring Parental investment and mate choice Contributions of each parent to raising offspring Estimate energy spent by male and female in offspring care Parent with the greatest cost should make choice for mate Generally female, may be male Depends on cost of parental care Fundamental differences between males and females Size of gametes: egg significantly larger than sperm Nutritional value of gametes: egg more than sperm Care costly to females that gestate and lactate Some males increase cost by collecting food, defending and feeding young Males may show mate choice if they have high parental investment Example: male cricket spermatophore = 30% of body weight Females compete for males Males choose large females to produce more offspring fig 55.9 Reproductive competition and sexual selection Reproductive competition: competitive interactions over access to mates Females frequently mate with largest male May be associated with competition between other males fig 55.10 Few males in population may sire most \nof offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define \"individual\" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by \"queen substance\", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed offspring, watch for predators, defend territory Can reproduce but do not for a period of time Nest with helpers have more offspring tbl 55.1 Helpers are often fledged offspring of those they help Resembles family situation Evolution explained by inclusive fitness concept Vertebrate Alarm Calling Activity of certain individuals benefit group at expense to individual Example: meerkats fig 55.5 Individuals act as sentries for group May give alarm call when predator sighted Draws attention to itself to protect others Behavior seems contrary to own self interest Example: Belding`s ground squirrels Colonies female-based, \nmales not related to any females Females with relatives nearby more likely to sound alarm than females with no kin nearby Alarm calling favors nepotism Socioecology Vertebrate societies have characteristic organization fig 55.22 Examines influence of environment on social organization Factors include food type and predation Example: African weaver birds Forest species fig 55.23a Builds camouflaged solitary nest Monogamous mating Eat insects Savanna species fig 55.23b Nest in colonies in trees Polygynous mating Eat seeds Feeding and nesting depend on area ecology Mating form dependent on feeding and expense of being a parent Sociality in African ungulates correlate with diet HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY Theories of Animal Sociobiology and Human Applications Could readily examine human activities Exhibit kin-selected altruism and reciprocity Show extensive parental care of offspring Possess variety of mating systems Exhibit unevolutionary behaviors like adoption Two Processes Led to Adaptive Change in Human Evolution Biological evolution Primate heritage shared with chimpanzees Include kin-selected and reciprocal altruism Traits are definitely adaptive in non-human primates Cultural evolution Transfer of information needed for survival Nongenetic mode of adaptation Passed from generation to generation by tradition Includes use of tools, shelter construction, marriage practices Difficult to identify biological components of human behavior Study cross-cultural traits May have been affected by natural selection May result from genes fixed in human populations Examples: Most mammals and human species are polygamous Many cultures exhibit same greeting pattern Many biologists resist explaining human behavior in evolutionary terms Has been used in past to support racist, fascist, sexist policies Potential for abuse still exists If behaviors are \"hardwired\" negative behaviors like violence and aggression cannot easily be changed Human behavior is affected by innate and learned components Study of human behavior will continue to be provocative [Return to Chapter 55 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to

publish-contacted by Alfred Wallace in 1858, who had independently come to the same conclusions Basis of theory limited food and space variety within a species (variations are inherited and passed on) success of some individuals due to individual variation, some are more successful than others at leaving offspring Darwinian \"fitness\" or success is limited to production of offspring Inheritance of successful traits successful organisms have inherited traits that help them survive traits carried by individuals that produce no offspring will die out natural selection environment determines which individuals are most successful and will reproduce Artificial selection goes on all the time Nature selects for or against traits Populations change with time Changes in population are shaped by natural selection over time a population changes to the point that it is a different species Definitions Population=individuals of the same species in a defined area Species=actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations (production of viable offspring) Evolution=genetic changes with time Populations evolve, individuals do not Individual's genetic composition is set at conception Genes, located on chromosomes code for various traits Genes exist in two or more forms called alleles Genotype=genetic makeup Phenotype=physical appearance Variability (or genetic diversity) is critical Problems with lack of variabiliy (disease can wipe out populations without enough variable resistance) Variability can be effected by factors that produce new alleles mutations-occur randomly-some good-most bad-may be selected for or against resuffling of existing alleles recombination offspring differ from parents through random recombination of alleles random combinations may make individuals more or less fit (or have no effect) increases variability genetic drift separation of populations smaller group=less \nvariability interbreeding causes more homogeneous populations e.g. reproductive isolation of european royal families resulted in expression of hemophilia migration introduction of new individuals into populations exit of existing members of population the impact varies depending on the size of the population selection pressures anything that systematically alters the genotypes of a population in natural selection, nature does the selecting in artificial selection humans do the selection selection is based on phenotypic characteristics examples peppered moth cows grazing in pasture Evidence for Evolution Evidence from Fossil Record shows what extinct life forms looked like gaps occur in fossil record newer layers of rock (and fossils) are deposited on older layers show that different organisms lived at different times organisms from the past are different than those today fossils found close to each other are similar (those distant from each other are more different) sometimes intermediate forms are found generally, older rocks have more simple fossils than more recent Evidence from Comparative Anatomy natural selection can only use existing structures and gradually modify them homologous structures-related structures in related organisms e.g. forelimbs of mammals same bones exist but forms change man to bat to whale vestigal organs-basic organs with no apparent use in the current form, but string resemblance to ancestral forms humans retain vertebrae that wiggle tails whales retain hipbones Evidence from Embryology embryos of many organisms are very similar human embryos pass through stage with gill slits and tails Evidence from Biochemistry All living organisms use DNA and the same amino acids Patterns of Evolution Gradual change populations change slowly over many years, gradually producing new species
