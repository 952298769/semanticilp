the five senses to observe the physical environment arrange and classify objects according to attributes or properties communicate data orally and through simple graphs, pictures, written statements,

questions Earth and Space Science Students: investigate and understand Earth s natural resources and how to protect them explain why air, water, and soil are natural resources describe ways to protect Earth s natural resources Students: develop an understanding of seasonal changes and cyclical patterns in nature, including temperature, precipitation, and cloud formation observe and communicate the day s weather orally and through graphic representations both on a daily basis and over a period of time use a thermometer as a tool to record the rise and fall of temperature&#9; observe and describe

to explore their surroundings and obtain different information from each sense work in groups to generate a visual organizer ( a web chart) showing how the senses can be used to describe the world

be classified according to certain characteristics identify the characteristics of plants including edible or nonedible, flowering or nonflowering, evergreen or deciduous (trees that lose their leaves in the winter) identify the needs of a plant including, air, water, light, and a place to grow identify the various sources from which plants grow, including seeds, bulbs, and parts of plants grow
