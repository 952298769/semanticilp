Reflexivity self-reflection by the researcher on his or her biases and predispositions Regression analysis a set of statistical procedures used to predict the values of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables Regression coefficient the predicted change in Y given a one unit change in X Regression line the line that best fits a pattern of observations Regression equation the equation that defines the regression line Reliability consistency or stability Repeated sampling drawing many or all possible samples from a population Repeated-measures design a design in which all participants participate in all experimental treatment conditions Replication logic the idea that the more times a research finding is shown to be true with different sets of people, the more confidence we can place in the finding and in generalizing beyond the original participants Replication research examining the same variables with different people Representative sample a sample that resembles the population Research design the outline, plan, or strategy used to answer a research question Research ethics a set of principles to guide and assist researchers in deciding which goals are most important and in reconciling conflicting values Research hypothesis the hypothesis of interest to the researcher and the one he or she would like to see supported by the study results Research method overall research design and strategy Research plan the outline or plan that will be used in conducting the research study Research problem see problem Researcher bias obtaining results consistent with what the researcher wants to find Researcher-as-detective metaphor applied to researcher when searching for cause and effect Response rate the percentage of people in a sample that participate in a research study Response set tendency to respond in a specific direction regardless of content Retrospective research the researcher starts with the dependent variable and moves backward in time Retrospective questions questions asking people to recall something from an earlier time RIE an index of abstracts of research reports Rule of parsimony preferring the most simple theory that works Back Sample the set of elements taken from a larger population Sampling the process of drawing a sample from a population Sampling error the difference between the value of a sample statistic and a population parameter Sampling frame a list of all the elements in a population Sampling with replacement it is possible for elements to be selected more than once Sampling without replacement it is not possible for elements to be selected more than once Sampling interval the population size divided by the desired sample size;",0.5391400456428528],["The inside circle

helped out Sidney and getting these pilot projects in the state of Nebraska actually established one was Camey Post who was out in the Western panhandle part of the state of Nebraska and then the bluff area and I was in the Carney area which is the south central part of the state I am a senior out at the University of Nebraska at Carney and am majoring in aggor-business and communications and Sidney originally approached me this last Christmas break when I was working out at the Department of Agriculture on Christmas vacation and so she asked me to accept this job as a intern and my primary goal was to see if we could get one established in the Carney area and simply do this by going out in the Carney community and talking to organizations and service clubs and establishing what were doing why were doing it and how were doing it and by using that three step process we were actually able to form a group and so I accepted the position and without knowing anything about health insurance and I ve uh its been a learning process no doubt I ve talked to my advisor and I got some college course credit for it as well but um our story was a success and I worked on it for about 4 months and primarily I did this by first of all determining who were the key players in the Carney area and so the Carney chamber of Commerce was a key part in helping this actually get established in telling me who I should talk to and who do I need to that has pulling power in the Carney area that can actually and reach the community and reach the public and tell them and actually invite individuals who are in the individual health insurance market who are underinsured or are uninsured and actually bring them into the group and give them an opportunity and help them out as far as health insurance goes so I talked to about a dozen different organizations and I always enjoyed public speaking in high school and I decided to pursue it as one of my majors but I found out the true challenge is actually answering the questions and so I would uh, occasionally I would deliver a co presentation with Sindey and she would just nail off the answers right away and so um before I give a presentation I would just study and study and study and so when I would go to the group and they would actually ask the questions the first thing I would say was I ll be honest with you I am an intern I am just learning about health insurance but I ll do the best I can to answer your questions but what I found what many of the questions were similar and because the questions were similar I made the assumption that everyone has the same types of problems um you know with the health insurance premiums increasing by 90% with 33% of the nations people in agriculture underinsured obviously this was a high problem after talking to the organizations I made personal phone calls contacting people who were interested telling them when we were going to have our group presentation and actually talk about this group and see if they would actually want to become a part of the group I contacted the media which was the key part in this process talking to agricultural radio stations as well as out in the western panhandle they did interviews with TV and newspaper articles were also crucial and it was actually the media and the political champions who actually made the people respond to make the people call back to my dorm room and I de come back with about 10 different messages and they would say there s something about the health insurance and to help out people in individual insurance market can you give me some answers can you tell me what this is actually about and so as time progressed there is in fact some individuals who said that we weren t going to \nbe successful they admired our courage in going into this but they frankly told me on the phone this is not going to work for you and they said its not going to work out um and so I keep telling Sindey we have got to call these people back and say it did work we were successful and so um that was the greatest part of the satisfaction was knowing that it actually did work and again it was because of the pulling power of the people int he Carney area talking with people talking with people in the Good Samaritan Hospital the Executive Director he told me he said you know if you re going to provide insurance to individual insurance people this is the way to go contact the actual public and for a purchasing cooperative he said this is the best way to go about it again with their support of these people as well as the political players the key part was starting low int he Carney area and moving up to the state wide area and with that why then I ll put up the first overhead so in April we had about 70 people that showed up we simply gave them he presentation and told them about it and then on June 9 we gave a presentation in Carney of the people who actually said they wanted to become a part of the group and this time there were um approximately 100 people at that area in the group who said that their interested so at this first meeting we said we adopted by laws and the constitution simply stating the organization was formed and that s its established and this is our orders that this group will abide by we elected a board of trustees who were kind of like the cabinet and actually the people who will make sure that they keep on top of things and be responsible for contacting the third party administrator we defined the time frame and the goals as to when the group will actually propose for a bid and this time frame is actually set for September which is actually ahead of schedule what we originally intended and we set our goals as to what we wanted to achieve by each separate meeting and finally the requests for proposal and the contact for the insurance expert or the third party administrator who can go out in the individual health insurance market and bring back to the group these different insurance plans that the group can choose from and the results as I stated there were two sites one from the Carney area and 200 to 250 members in each group only after 2 meetings and so again the media contacts the pulling power in these two areas are key and we gave a multiplier factor of .8 and basically teats stating for every one member in the group they will influence 2.8 people and so by as time increased we would expect these groups to be at 560 to 700 members which is obviously stating that there is a need and these people do need some type of health insurance and this is the way to go about it as far as the future is concerned I am very optimistic and I think you had to be optimistic about this at the very beginning I know Sindey was and its because of her expertise and actually looking at the Kennedy Kassabam law and determining what it was that this law can provide to Nebraska and actually pursuing this project Nebraska was successful in these projects and there s articles to actually show it and there are several different articles this was in the Carney Hub one week end additionally here are other articles and I believe that this was successful in Nebraska and we hope it can become a multi state model not only for our nation but hopefully for other countries as well who says that Nebraska or who says that this nation is the only country that needs these types of insurance groups we believe this is something that can become a global issue the economy is becoming more global I think this is something that was addressed in our state but in other states as well there aren t only local newspapers and organizations but there are state wide newspapers and magazine that actually address this issue in fact regional magazines too in fact I think Successful Farmer did one then they said a regional magazine in the mid west that addressed these problems It was in the Omaha World Herald which in some cases reaches into Iowa as well and so although these articles that contacted the people as the people champion Governor Ben Nelson is a Governor I was telling Sindey before I said we started low in the Carney area and the Bluff area talking to the individual organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and we simply moved up the line and as we moved up the line up into the Insurance Commissioner as well as the Governor it attracted the media in addition to the media we ve already contacted and this actually got spread out to the group with these types of endorsements such as the media and such as these political players this was key role to our success the most frequently asked questions are what is the cost what are the tax benefits and when can people actually join.",0.46725940704345703],["Other Areas of

noise of time the noise of time i suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably

UNAUTHORIZED USE Summary REFERENCES EXAM AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS NOTES UNIT 44 - DATABASE CONCEPTS II Compiled with assistance from Gerald White, California State University, Sacramento A. INTRODUCTION setting up and maintaining a spatial database requires careful planning, attention to numerous issues many GIS were developed for a research environment of small databases many database issues like security not considered important in many early GIS difficult to grow into an environment of large, production-oriented systems Databases for spatial data many different data types are encountered in geographical data, e.g. pictures, words, coordinates, complex objects very few database systems have been able to handle textual data e.g. descriptions of soils in the legend of a soil map can run to hundreds of words e.g. descriptions are as important as numerical data in defining property lines in surveying - \"metes and bounds\" descriptions variable length records are needed, often not handled well by standard systems e.g. number of coordinates in a line can vary this is the primary reason why some GIS designers have chosen not to use standard database solutions for coordinate data, only for attribute tables standard database systems assume the order of records is not meaningful in geographical data the positions of objects establish an implied order which is important in many operations often need to work with objects that are adjacent in space, thus it helps to have these objects adjacent or close in the database is a problem with standard database systems since they do not allow linkages between objects in the same record type (class) there are so many possible relationships between spatial objects, that not all can be stored explicitly however, some relationships must be stored explicitly as they cannot be computed from the geometry of the objects, e.g. existence of grade separation at street crossing the integrity rules of geographical data are too complex e.g. the arcs forming a polygon must link into a complete boundary e.g. lines cannot cross without forming a node effective use of non-spatial database management solutions requires a high level of knowledge of internal structure on the part of the user e.g. user may need to be aware that polygons are composed of arcs, and stored as arc records, cannot treat them simply as objects and let the system take care of the internal structure users are required to have too much knowledge of the database model, cannot concentrate on knowledge of the problem users may have to use complex commands to execute processes which are conceptually simple The relational model in GIS the relational model captures geographical reality through a set of tables (relations) linked by keys (common fields or attributes) each table contains a set of records (tuples) tables are normalized to minimize redundancy of information, maximize integrity in general, the relational model is a convenient way to represent reality each table corresponds to a set of real-world features with common types of attributes the user needs to know which features are stored in which tables however the relational model has certain deficiencies for spatial data many implementations (e.g. ARC/INFO) store only the attribute tables in the relational model, since it is less straightforward to store the geometrical descriptions of objects - such systems have been called \"hybrid\" most spatial operations are not part of the standard query language of RDBMSs, e.g. find objects within a user-defined polygon, e.g. overlay, e.g. buffer zone generation the relational model does not deal easily and efficiently with the concept of complex objects (objects formed by aggregating simple objects) - this concept is more compatible with the hierarchical data model B. DATA SECURITY many systems for small computers, and systems specializing in geometric and geographical data, do not provide functionality necessary to maintain data integrity over long periods of time Integrity constraints integrity constraints are rules which the database must obey in order to be meaningful attribute values must lie within prescribed domains relationships between objects must not conflict, e.g. \"flows into\" relationship between river segments must agree with \"is fed by\" relationship locational data must not violate rules of planar enforcement, contours must not cross each other, etc. Transactions transactions may include: modifications to individual data items addition or deletion of entire records addition or deletion of attributes changes in schema (external views of the database) e.g. addition of new tables or relations, redefinition of access keys all of the updates or modifications made by a user are temporary until confirmed system checks integrity before permanently modifying the database (\"posting\" the changes to the database) updates and changes can be abandoned at any time prior to final confirmation C. CONCURRENT USERS in many cases more than one user will need \nto access the database at any one time this is a major advantage of multi-user systems and networks however, if the database is being modified by several users at once, it is easy for integrity constraints to be violated unless adequate preventative measures exist changes may interfere and produce loss of integrity e.g. user B may change an object while user A is processing it the results will not be valid for either the old or the new version of the object e.g. a dispatching system operator A receives a fire call, sends a request to fire station 1 to dispatch a vehicle, waits for fire station to confirm operator B receives a fire call after A's call but before A confirms the dispatch result may be that both A and B request a dispatch of the same fire truck solution should be to \"lock\" the first request until confirmed automatic control of concurrent use is based on the transaction concept the database is modified only at the end of a transaction concurrent users never see the effects of an incomplete transaction interference between two concurrent users is resolved at the transaction level Three types of concurrent access unprotected - applications may retrieve and modify concurrently in practice, no system allows this, but if one did, system should provide a warning that other users are accessing the data protected - any application may retrieve data, but only one may modify it e.g. user B should be able to query the status of fire trucks even after user A has placed a \"hold\" on one exclusive - only one application may access the data Checkout/checkin in GIS applications, digitizing and updating spatial objects may require intensive work on one part of the database for long periods of time e.g. digitizer operator may spend an entire shift working on one map sheet work will likely be done on a workstation operating independently of the main database because of the length of transactions, a different method of operation is needed at beginning of shift, operator \"checks out\" an area from the database at end of work, the same area is \"checked in\", modifying and updating the database while an area is checked out, it should be \"locked\" by the main database this will allow other users to read the data, but not to check it out themselves for modification this resolves problems which might occur e.g. user A checks out a sheet at 8:00 am and starts updating user B checks out the same sheet at 9:00 am and starts a different set of updates from the same base if both are subsequently allowed to check the sheet back in, then the second checkin may try to modify an object which no longer exists the area is unlocked when the new version is checked in and modifies the database the amount of time required for checkout and checkin must be no more than a small part of a shift Determining extent of data locking how much data needs to be locked during a

\nkm of smelters - two very sensitive species - Pinus strobus (white pine) and Vaccinium myrtiloides - understory vegetation also affected but less severely ( Figure 2.3 ) - aquatic: - in immediate area around Sudbury - local lakes were acidic with no fish - problem of separating effects of acidic deposition from effects of simultaneous metal deposition in areas close to Sudbury smelters - Figure 3.5 shows that levels of copper and nickel in soils also correlated with distance from smelter suggesting that airborne deposition (mostly dry particulate deposition) was responsible for elevated metal concentrations in soils (as well as increased acidity) - increased metal concentrations and lower soil pH causes reduction in number of species and in biomass (size of trees) - devastation of local vegetation close to smelter may be due toelevated metals instead of acid depositions alone - to reduce local effects - higher stacks (\"superstacks\") were built in the early 1970s to carry SO 2 emissions higher into the atmosphere where it was believed that the effects would be diluted and local impacts reduced - results: - local improvement was reported - but acid rain affected a much wider area causing a regional impact (b) Regional Effects of SO 2 Emissions - regions of North America affected by acid rain are illustrated in Figure 4.1 - areas most susceptible to damage were on Canadian Precambrian Shield where poorly buffered soils and waters offered little resistance to acidic inputs - areas most affected were in eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes) and northeastern United States (Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New England States) - following predominantly northeast flow of air-borne pollutants from the north central U.S. (primarily Ohio valley where there is extensive coal mining and coal based industries) - Table 4.2 gives a comparison of chemical constituents in rain over maritime, continental and prairie regions - Maritime region was mildly impacted by acid rain because this region already experiences high SO 4 levels from ocean sources - Prairie regions are well buffered and would resist acidic inputs - also due to wind direction, western regions were not affected by acid rain sources which were located in eastern North America - Continental regions were most impacted because of proximity to acid generating sources, location in major air transport pathways, and because of poorly buffered waters and soils - Dorset area located within impact zone from Sudbury had notably higher levels of SO 4 and H + than

casualties are before the mind- but your letter was welcome news- do not imagine that when I am terrified and anxious I publish to the friends- I thought of beginning my letter with the Chorus of John Brown- but then you might think me daft- Our ticket the whole ticket is elected- Mr Stephenson was speaking of Col Matthews- and after saying probably his health had something to do with it- his manner led me to suppose there were other reasons- but I do not like to have an officer leave his post for office- I know nothing of affairs- but wish most heartily I was with you in the Cabin or tent- what a happy two months it was to me- Where did the Rebels come in- near Summerville or in the other direction- Shall I order you a coat from Spragues- I called there and they have your measure- a coat will cost 35$-- now- you ought to have one and all I wait for is the order- Coat pants and vest- one or all- which is it- how does the tattered colors look in the new Camp- I should always want to fight under their folds- Yesterday Miss Clorinda Wright and Mrs Miner called to see us they sent kindest regards to our Soldiers- Mr Higgins, has been appointed Assessor or something of that kind in New Orleans- Mrs Miner thought he ought not to have been rewarded for his grea t devotion to the Union quite so easily- I agreed with her- I would give a good deal to meet with Gen Burnside- \nand if you were in his command- I would make the effort truth is Ruddy I am modest - a good quality some times- but under the present dispensation rather unfortunate- are you acquainted with my husband he has that quality in a very high degree- The sun is shinning [sic] brightly- but the air is keen and cold- I am trying to write with a gold pen- and I believe it makes my scrawl worse than ever- &quot;Oh that I had the pen of a ready writer&quot; would'nt [sic] you suffer- Mother is coughing a good deal- this changeable weather has been severe upon her- but by the help of wine and ....... the unmentionable drink- she is again inproving [sic] her health was so much better while we were gone- a fortunate thing for me- we had a visit from Dr James Ware formerly of Columbus- but now Surgeon in

As usual I might begin my letter with apologies- but I do not find much time for writing to friends Our visit to Virginia was very pleasant indeed- the boys were perfectly happy- and it was with a great deal of regret that they came home- Mother and the two little ones were very well and did not miss me in the least- Since my return Mother has not been well- the changeable spring weather is always very severe upon her- I have seen quite a number of my friends since we returned all were well- Mrs Herron has a fine little girl- they are living on Walnut Hills- so I do not get to see her as often as I would like- it is a beautiful place I have spent one night with her- Birchie has started to school- and is getting along pretty well- the others are still home beaux Last week we were doing some house cleaning- not quite through yet- I miss the visits of the little girls- (though why I say little I do not know) Fannie has been to see me twice- she is looking well and happy- I hear quite

BC Royal Commission on Workers Compensation in BC Meeting Notes: Location of Meeting: WCB, Richmond Date: April 17, 1998 Commissioner staff: GG, GS, OE, TR, D , JS Notetaker: Judy Stott _ General Comments Occupational health and safety program delivery Fatality claims and benefits outstanding issues _ presentation ALAN WINTER Topics that I will discuss Preventative compensation and rehabilitation and protective reassignment I am going to start with medical surveillance This is not an area I get involved in so I have some information from clients and have some vague idea Medical surveillance There was a regulatory review process that had all sorts of committees and there was a medical program committee and the issue of medical surveillance was dealt with through that committee On the employers side Doug Ali from the business council was a member of that committee and that is the person who I have been chatting to Employers are not opposed to the concept of medical surveillance with respect to exposures to a variety of substances My understanding is that the substances were identified and agree to at this medical program committee so I don t think that was an outstanding issue The issues that were outstanding were selection of doctor and confidentiality of the records I noticed that the BC Federation of Labour had put in a written submission way back in July and the issue was dealt with there Selection of doctors If I understand labour s position they want the worker to be able to choose their own doctor to go to for medical surveillance The employer view is that the medical examination should be conducted by a specialist in the area For example, I have certain clients that have in house medical departments that perform medical surveillance as part of that I know that Alcan does with respect to bladder cancer the preventative side And I think Cominco has in house medical too The employer community went and said that there are people that specialize both in house medical departments and outside experts and those are the people that we want to take the tests and provide the results and any comments on those results that is needed If we get into a problem of who the doctor should be then the Board should step in and put together an approved list of specialists for the particular types of areas that are going to require medical surveillance We would request that that list also be able to include specialists or doctors that work primarily for large employers and who do that testing Confidentiality of results Labour s position is that the results must be kept confidential to the worker and not given to the employer That is a very difficult issue to understand The testing, I presume is with respect to levels of a specified substance associated with that employer s workplace So the reason there is medical surveillance arises from the work relationship It doesn t really make a lot of sense why the employer shouldn t get the results Now I don t know exactly how wide the tests are If you take a urine or a blood sample and the tests go wider than what you are looking for and show that there are traces of marijuana then I understand why that shouldn t be given to the employer It is not relevant to what the test was My limited understanding from Mr. Ali is that is not what the test results would be If you are testing for lead the results are going to be on lead so it doesn t make a lot of sense why the employer wouldn t be given the test results for medical surveillance flowing from that work relationship There are two reasons why they should get it \nOne is for the particular employee so they have an idea of what is going on with that employee and so that they can take appropriate steps when needed as opposed to waiting until the red light is given to them by an outside 3 rd party More importantly so that they have the information from a wider group of people so if steps need to be taken on a wider basis the information is being given to the employer for safety and preventative reasons so that they know that something doesn t seem right and maybe it is something that they should examine The concerns, if I understood them, were use of the information and I think that can be dealt with through section 95 already The information that would be given to the employer would only be for the purposes of the act so there should be no other use of that information and it is difficult to see why it would be used for other reasons If the concern is that the employer is going to get the information and take other unrelated steps like firing the person because their lead level is going too high then there are other forums that can deal with that human rights for medical reasons or arbitration in that kind of environment The last issue on medical surveillance is that there was a discussion about mandatory testing I think that we are going to see mandatory testing continue as an issue but it is being dealt in the human rights There are certain industries that are going to require mandatory testing either because external forces are going to put it on them or for safety and prevention reasons they have to do it Trucking is the one that comes mainly to mind 90% of trucking you don t have to worry about because it is inter-provincial or inter-jurisdictional so it falls under the Canada Labour Code There are intra-provincial trucking firms that face the same safety concerns and those are the industries that are looking for mandatory drug testing for example If I understand it that was another topic that was raised there I think that that is a human rights kind of issue Q: Did you say that the trucking industry has this now

well as other Mm is tries/Department of the Union Government are to name a few of them 6 15 While eludlcatmg on the aspect of monitoring Secretary, Department of Rural Development informed the Committee during the oral evidence, Monitoring of rural development programmes ib done in various ways One, of course, is we get monthly, quarterly and annual reports from the State Governments for each programme Then, there is a concurrent evaluation which is done by social sciences research organisations We give our programmes to them and they select certain villages and then they tell us what is the success rate, how many people are getting employment, how many people really got benefitted and those reports are compiled We have reports which are based not so much on Government organisations but Semi-Government and research organisations doing this kind of a monitoring Then, the officers from our Ministry visit some villages to find out what is the state of programme implementation Often, we hire prnate consultants to go to a field and find out what is being done Then, the Planning Commission has a Programme Evaluation Organisation Por instance, recently, they evaluated the drinking water programme and gave us information about how many people are getting dunking water, how many water pumps are not working and how much time is being taken for repairs, etc Therefore, independent organisations at various levels are involved in this monitoring In addition, because m certain programmes the United Nations agencies are also working, they send their own teams to evaluate and assess a programme Their teams which are called supervisory missions would visit certain villages and give their reports as to what is happening in the villages Therefore, we do have a system of monitoring and evaluation But we do feel that we must strengthen this monitoring In the last six months, our effort has been to engage more private people and academic to go and do surprise visits to a village incognito so that no one knows them and then give us the feedback We have Just formulated these schemes and those reports would start coming soon This way, we would be strengthening our monitoring and evaluation system \" He further added, In the monitoring, we are also involving the NGOs Recently, we have sent an NGO team to the States of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Onssa to study watershed development programme We are also keen that we should not be dependent on the reports coming from the States So, the information that we get from these different sources is sent to the State Governments as our feedback so that they will improve We are very much alive to this issue \" 616 When asked as to what feedback other than the information furnished by the State Governments was available with the Cential Government to monitor the implementation and progress of the \nSchemes of the Central Government it was stated that m this regard the Government was totally dependent on the figures furnished by the State Governments Asked further as to were any sample verification of these fact and figures done by the Central Government it was stated that as of now no verification of facts and figures have been carried out 6.17 Notwithstanding the fact that rural development is a State Subject and all States are implementing then own schemes for the

theory because it worked so well in phonetics or has almost worked so well in phonetics and is about to work perfectly in phonetics and there would be for any word lexeme sounds good technical lexeme high class twenty third proof sheet lexeme basically we ought to be able to reduce the lexicon to a presumably finite set of lexemes though there are problems in that because at the same time that it will have to be finite it will have to be potentially nonfinite because you can always coin new words from old ones or parts of old ones or merely from new arrangements of phonemes by a set of rules from the word generating system which would have to be a part of the systematic lexicon this would be the word generating part of the lexicon and this set of words would presumably have new meanings different from the collection of old meanings which they might well so that as the world filled up with distinguishable new things or new states or new acts or modalities the lexicon would have to fill up with new meanings to distinguish them but this is only the potentially nonfinite part of the lexicon what we would expect to find would be a finite if fairly large set of quite general or abstract features and some kind of rules for combining and partitioning these into all the words that have been and may have to come to be though this might sound overly ambitious even to a language scientist at m.i.t. or to a structuralist at the ecole des haute etudes though there is no accounting for what would sound overly ambitious to them since there are so many people standing in back of them working out just these problems still more modestly you might want to ask of this lexicon that it lay out at least a fairly compact set of features to generate the system of references and senses of a significant segment of the words currently used in a particular natural language like english now how would they do this by a feature theory that proved so successful in phonetics now the nucleus of the lexicon will consist of a set of features and what kind of features will they be you know they will be binary contrasting features sets of opposing pairs like hot and cold or hard and soft but much more abstract perhaps so they could apply to a great variety of words to some degree and form a kind of feature system thesaurus of the language and each feature would be two poles of a kind of axis with one end positive and the other negative or one end zero and the other one oddly enough it will resemble somewhat machine computer language and that may surprise you but it shouldnt be too surprising because so many things now are analyzed in this way which is clear and unequivocal and convenient for the machines which we now have so many of and which seem so reasonable now that we have so many people acclimated to working with these machines and it is of course easy to distinguish zero and one the empty set and the full set that it might seem simple even reasonable to approach the lexicon this way marking each lexeme as a bundle of features that are scored zero when they are absent and one when theyre present and say you only bother to mark features that are present otherwise these features are absent now lets take a pair of words like \"generous\" and \"thrifty\" say we could probably find an axis that ran through them unfortunately we could find many more than one axis

Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end I saw a shadow Lurked in the darkness I thought security Because the article How many times I've past before Those iron gates Can I cry once more Since I was five I've heard the words Now only vinyl Is left to hear The Tears Did Shed For You Billy Will it get better Will it get worse There's rainy weather With a black hearse The tears did shed While not believing A word you said So much grieving Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn away It starts in you It starts in me Help restore our earth So future generations can be We Make Each minute that passes 100 acres of tropical forest Goes never to come back Within just one hour 4000 \nchildren starve to death While surplus crops go bad Every day that goes by There are 27 oil spills In the United States alone In one orbit around the sun More than a trillion dollars Of killing weapons we make In Order To Exist Its come so quick Its hard to tell In just a flick We've emptied the well Foresight is cheap When it's too late We're sinking in deep Still wanting the bait Computer malfunction Warning overload Drastic measures needed In order to continue We must all realize this is it We must change In order to exist As If By Divine Plan Take some time And think about this Listen real careful Cause there's no time to miss It's getting beyond reach It's gotten out of hand The power hungry preach As if by divine plan And you don't know Or just let it go by And you're always on the go But always asking why They drain your life Squeeze every last drop Tell you of freedom When looking from the top Groomed Puppets That Deceive How clever the manipulation In this land of the free How money breeds dedication In the name of liberty With political promising lies You know better than believe They're all the same you realize Groomed puppets that deceive So you give up hope Believing it will never change Apathy is how you cope Something you always found strange Without Deception The ladder of success With cut out steps Leads you nowhere Without deception Too Much Too Soon And Then Well here we are again Apathetic up till the end Too much too soon and then No recourse Take Take Take It's total chaos It's complete madness It can't go on It'll never last Take take take Until no more Is left to give Test Subjects We are the test subjects We are the dying breed We are the last checks Here to balance the greed An awaken you all So we can plant a new seed Knock down the wall That strangles you like a weed We are here to change Extinction to perpetuation Get rid of the strange Leading us to devastation It's all up to us To want a new day With us you can trust We won't lead you astray What's best for all Is the way it will be Knock down the wall For unity is the key And it won't be easy Cause they're set in their way Molded in the cast Until their dying day Which won't be long So we have no time to waste We've already been led along So now we have to haste And think for tomorrow Forget about yesterday It will only bring you sorrow And happiness is the only way Evolution's Choice Is Now Sand slipping through The hour glass Evolution's choice is now Humanity's last pass Won't wait Tomorrow's awareness In vain too late Today's judgment Decides earth's fate You've Given Up Hope You've given up hope You can't change the system Mellowing out with age You no longer try to resist them You've lost your morals They've changed your ways But deep down it eats at you They've trapped you in the maze Torn between the dream you had And the life you live Still knowing your being had But not wanting to give Inhospitable In every way possible We're destroying ourselves Making tomorrow inhospitable As long as today it sells Extinct Is Forever Man's the enemy Technology the tool Extinct is forever Don't be a fool And say it's all right Or laugh it away Stand up and fight Our numbers will say Something positive That will catch like fire An expose all the greedy Cold hearted liars To Shed Some Light I try to write About what I feel is wrong To shed some light About how we're led along In this land of the free We must be brave For our future you see A new road we must pave Playing Fate With Dice We are our own god For good or bad Our earth paradise So don't be mad In the years to come We pay the price Following blinded leaders Playing fate with dice A Merry Go Round It's just the same old game With the played out scenes A merry go round with inbetweens Lost in a fog in a sea of confusion Looking for help through realities illusion Got to break out and get away Or the conditioning ties will stay Trapping you till tomorrow's today Becomes a bitter memory of yesterday Government Sponsored There's no way out Unless you care I can scream and shout About what ain't fair But you've got to change From deep inside Brought up fast and strange Don't run and hide From the troubled day By taking drugs To escape the pain It's a cover up To keep us down Government sponsored Every pound Throw In The Towel Toxic dumps Radiation leaks Cancer lumps Mutated freaks Toxic shock Agent orange Government mock Goes on and on Nuclear waste Leukemia rate Technology haste Is our fate Love canal TMI Throw in the towel And wave good-bye Oil spills Nerve gas seeps Man kills No longer reaps Arms race Strip mining Pollution pace Elegant dining Atomic tests Silkwood dead Militarily best To beat the red Drug sedaters Alcohol waiters Shut you up Make you give up Take Responsibility Turn away And it only gets worse Stay in the gray Until your in the hearse \nTake responsibility And it can only get better We have the ability It's just the choice of whether We take responsibility Or turn away When Humanity Wept How do you cope With global suicide How do you hope When you turn and hide What is there left For you to believe in When humanity wept Drowned in their grieving I Still Imagine In first grade My President was blown away I wondered why In fifth grade Martin and Robert were filled with lead I began to understand In the summer before high school Morrison was in French soil But no one was there I became scared For John The warmest 8th of December In New York City history I was driving my cab When Vinny broke the news From that day till now At 29 Every time I pass 1 West 72nd street I feel humanity Has no hope But I still imagine A Paradise Yours Pure There's always been war You don't learn by mistakes A paradise yours pure And only one for the takes For Tomorrow Today We're at the time When we can't look away We need a solution For tomorrow today A Handful Of Companies A handful of companies Make the decisions They bought the country Electing their politicians An army full of men To protect and kill The number one game Leader of the hill Not Knowing It's the thought of not knowing If we'll be here

effects of acidification on zooplankton - there is a decrease in total number of species below pH 6 but most dramatic changes occur below pH 5.5 - shift from larger daphnids to smaller taxa such as Bosmina - under very acidic conditions (&lt; pH 5), rotifers (e.g. Brachionus, Keratella ) are dominant zooplankton - shifts in zooplankton community composition may be due to the following factors: (1) direct toxicity of H + and associated metals such as aluminum (2) indirect impacts due to change in food, i.e. phytoplankton species composition which shifts from smaller (more edible) algal and cyanobacterial species to larger (less edible) dinoflagellates ( bottom-up influences ) (3) indirect impacts due to changes in nature and intensity of predation, e.g. if acidification causes extinction of plankivorous (= zooplankton-eating) fish ( top-down influences ) ii) Benthic invertebrates: are less species rich in acidic lakes but can be abundant if predatory fish have disappeared Benthos of acidic lakes typically dominated by: (1) Crustacea including Copepoda, Cladocera, Amphipoda and Isopoda (2) Insecta - Notonectidae, Corixidae, Chironomidae, Megaloptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera - all above include both acid-tolerant and acid-intolerant species - some benthic amphipods (e.g. Gammarus lacustris and Hyallela azteca ) are very sensitive to acidification - dominance by insects demonstrated for many acidic lakes - chironomids are very common (because the acidity of surface sediments does not change as rapidly as the acidity of water, these bottom-dwelling spp. are able to survive) iii) Amphibians: - are either completely aquatic or enter water to breed - less affected by lake acidification than fish - recent reports show decline in frog populations and in species diversity (which may make amphibians \"early-warning\" species of ecosystem stress - more research required to understand importance of this finding) (check FrogWatch web site for further information on amphibians as sentinel species ) iv) Fish: - changes in fish community were the earliest documented effects of acid rain in aquatic ecosystems - increased reports of \"fish-less\" lakes in both Scandinavia and N.E. North America) - most fishless lakes had pH &lt; 5 - extinction of fish, particularly salmonids, reported from acidified lakes and rivers - Salmonid species differ in sensitivity to acidification e.g. Atlantic salmon (migratory) requires pH > 5.0-5.5 for hatching and fry development but Brown trout (stationary - non-migratory) requires pH > 4.5 for proper development through life cycle - yellow perch and rock bass are most acid tolerant fish present (at pH &lt; 4.5) Fish Monitoring Studies: - in Scandinavia: - 7 acidified rivers \nin South Norway (by 1966) had depleted Atlantic salmon populations (estimated 150 tonnes in 1900) - in N.E. United States: - in Adirondacks in N.Y. state: many acidified lakes lost their fish - other fish populations lost/declined in Adirondack lakes include lake trout, rainbow trout, white sucker, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, creek chub - in Canada: - Atlantic Salmon sport fishery in many Nova Scotia rivers reduced or eliminated - in Killarney Lakes - close to Sudbury Ni/Cu smelters - acidified and metal polluted lakes which became affected by acid rain after building of \"superstack\" - extinction of several species of fish actually monitored in Lumsden and George Lakes DECOMPOSERS: i) bacteria ii) fungi i) Bacteria: - bacterial communities tend to be reduced as waters become more acidified (especially at pHs below 5) and rate of decomposition of organic matter (e.g. leaf litter, dead organisms) is reduced - recycling of nutrients is reduced ii) Fungi: - are relatively rare in most aquatic communities - can tolerate acidity better than most bacteria so tend to become more abundant at low pHs (usually below pH 3) - most common forms are molds (e.g. Aspergillus, Penicillium ) and yeasts (e.g. Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula ) Summary of Whole Ecosystem Manipulation Studies - to prove that acid rain alone could have an impact on aquatic ecosystems (without the confounding problems of metal deposition) - whole ecosystem manipulation studies were carried out in Canada (at ELA - Lake 223) and the United States (at Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin) - experimental lakes were in areas which were not directly impacted by acid rain - lakes were double-basin lakes which allowed the placement of a plastic liner in the narrowest part of the lake thus separating the two basins - both basins were studied for at least 1 year to establish normal conditions - then over about a 5-year period, sulfuric acid (other lakes involved nitric acid) was added directly to the lakewater (- this differed from natural rain situations where there would be direct acid inputs from the atmosphere as well as input from the surrounding watershed soils and rocks) - metal inputs from the watershed were not problem in these studies - changes in water chemistry and biological communities were followed throughout the study on a regular basis in both the control untreated basin and the experimental acidified basin - after 5 years, the ELA study continued with monitoring of the recovery of the lake (once acid additions were terminated) - the results of the ELA study are summarized in Table 10.1 and the Wisconsin Study in Table 10.2 - many of the patterns of sensitivity and resistance to acid additions confirmed the findings of the earlier monitoring studies (e.g. increase in periphytic algae, disappearance of fish, increase in chironomids, decrease in crayfish, etc.) - results showed importance of taxonomy - changes in species composition happened before changes in functional processes (e.g. productivity) 7.2.4.",0.39994388818740845],["This case has been examined more extensively, by more researchers, than any other case I know of.",0.39985114336013794],["Explain why samples of rain collected near the end of a storm are found to be less acidic than the rain at the beginning of a storm.",0.399679958820343],["Acid Rain Research Students collect samples of rainfall, cloud condensation, and water that trickles through the soil.",0.3995269536972046],["More intelligent animals can re-include feedback from what they did in ways which would let them begin at the beginning of an interrupted action, but even so this involves quite a different sequence than an uninterrupted action.",0.39941781759262085],["More intelligent animals can re-include feedback from what they did in ways which would let them begin at the beginning of an interrupted action, but even so this involves quite a different sequence than an uninterrupted action.",0.39941781759262085],["Soil samples taken during the study date back more than 9,000 years and suggest humans settled the area.",0.3994120955467224],["Recent research has linked high aluminum levels in drinking water to acid rain which leaches the aluminum out of the soil and transfers it to the ground water(4,28,29).",0.39921754598617554],["More detailed examination of the soil sample reveals small foci in which the Azotobacter cells are located.",0.39876672625541687],["Research Methods Surface water was taken into a glass sampling bottle at four different locations on Lake Hickory beginning in October, 1996.",0.3986803889274597]]
