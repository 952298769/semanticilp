 In summary, taste is too closely bound to the body and our animality.  From Plato and Aristotle forward, philosophy has highlighted human rationality as that which makes us unique and higher beings.  When this supremacy of the mind over the body is brought to bear on the senses, sight and hearing are considered higher senses whereas smell, touch, and taste are the lower senses.  The further the object of sense is from the body, the higher the sense.  This explains why so much of Western philosophy is articulated in the metaphor of sight.  We can see things from very far away.  We can hear things, likewise, from a distance.  But the sense of smell generally requires much greater proximity and, of course, that of touch must have direct contact. ",1.359270453453064],["Taste is a fairly crude sense -- there are only four values that your tongue can sense (sweet, salty, sour, bitter) -- while the nose can sense thousands of different odors.",1.3548004627227783],["Dogs and other animals that rely heavily on the sense of smell can identify odors concentrated in an object or piece of ground as small as a dime, Dr. Settles said, teasing from it all sorts of information.",1.3490569591522217],["She was certainly \"the observed of all observers,\" but hardly the object of admiration.",1.3337386846542358],["Up to 80% of what you might think is taste is really smell- humans can sense about 20,000 odors in many different strengths.",1.3320366144180298],["Indeed, in-cabin climate control can dry out the epithelium, a mucus lining in the back of the mouth that absorbs odorous molecules, dulling the dominant sense in wine tasting.",1.3320366144180298],["Metallic odors are so sharp that we can smell and taste them and even the least of the furbearing animals has a very sophisticated sense of smell compared to ours.",1.3320366144180298]]
