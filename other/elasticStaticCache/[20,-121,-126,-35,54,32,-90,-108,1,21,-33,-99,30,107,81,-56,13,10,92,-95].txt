[["is not &quot;wet&quot; Capillary - held against gravity but will move Gravitational - moves with gravity Capillary action Liquids such as water will rise and be held in small tubes, above their normal surface of repose Water pulled up into tube by adhesion to inner surface of tube and cohesion pulls more water along with it Gravity prevents rise to top of tube by pulling down water As tube diameter decreases, height of rise increases Surface area decreases more quickly than circumference Weight of water supported decreases more quickly than adhesion perimeter More pull upward than downward Some tubes small enough to retain water after removal from source Requires external energy for removal More energy required as tube diameter decreases Soil pores can be thought of as capillary tubes Water will move in soil against the force of gravity (rise) Soil Moisture Content Gravimetric - mass of water per mass of soil (g/kg) Wet basis - water per unit of wet soil Dry basis - water per unit of dry soil Volumetric - volume of water per volume of soil Also applicable as depth measurement Moisture tension Suction with which water is held in soil Approximates soil water potential Gives energy needed to remove water from the soil Soil Water Potential ( ) Usually expressed in terms of pressure (bars, pascals, etc.) 10 bars = 1 MPa Affected by 4 factors Position relative to reference position (gravitational effects) Application of external pressure Concentration of dissolved solutes (osmotic effects) Attraction to soil solids (matric effects) Soil water tends to move in a way that reduces its water potential Water potential ( ) is difference between free energy levels of soil water and pure water in a reference state w = g + p + o + m Gravitational potential is positive and is a function of height of water above reference elevation Positive indicates its doing work moving to reference height Matric potential a function of water's adhesion to soil particles Potential is negative because energy is released as water binds with particles or pore walls Must do work on water to move it Water held in small pores has lower free energy than that in larger pores Water is layered around particles with that nearest particle having lowest free energy Water moves from large to small pores and wetter to drier areas, spontaneously, rather than vice versa, unless under pressure \nOsmotic potential due to dissolved solutes' attraction for water molecules Negative, because must do work to purify water Water moves from zones of lesser to greater saltiness Soil water potential is usually &lt;0 because it is not pure water Negativity of average increases as soil dries because proportion of water held more tightly by soil increases Clays hold a given quantity of water more tightly and usually more water than sands because of smaller pores Characteristics of soil water fractions Gravitational Present in soils between 0 and -0.3 bars Drains by gravity Somewhat available to plants - little oxygen in soil Responsible for saturation of soils Field capacity - -0.3 bars Capillary Present between 0 and -30 bars Most important source of water for plants Plant available between 0 and -15 bars Does not drain by gravity Moved by matric and osmotic forces Permanent wilting point - -15 bars Hygroscopic coefficient - -31 bars Hygroscopic Present whenever soil contains any water Bound to surfaces Only water at tensions greater than -31 bars Texture affects how much water in soil is actually plant available Clays contain more water than loams, but more is hygroscopic Water Movement in Soils Darcy's Law used to quantify soil water movement Q = AK(d /dx) Q = water flow per unit time A = cross-sectional area of flow K = hydraulic conductivity d /dx = potential difference Water moves from zones of higher to lower potential Potential difference provides driving force for water movement Saturated Flow Conductivity is a function of pore diameter and tortuosity Potential difference is a function of Gravity - height difference External pressure Water moves to seek lowest level and relieve pressure May move down, up, or sideways until soil drains Unsaturated flow Flow in soils where water is not under pressure and does not move much in response to gravity Flow is through fine pores and along surfaces (very slow) Conductivity often a function of thickness of wetting films Driving forces are matric and osmotic potentials Water moves from Moister to drier zones Larger to smaller pores Less to more salty zones In response to suction Water moves much more quickly from coarse to fine-textured material than vice versa AIR IN THE SOIL Soil air usually contains less O2 and more CO2 than atmospheric air Most organisms in the soil consume O2 and evolve CO2 Generally saturated with water vapor Air enters the soil by two major mechanisms which generally replenish O2 and flush CO2 Diffusion across soil surfaces Movement from zones of higher to lower concentrations Due to random movement of molecules Very dependent on physical condition of surface Mass flows due to physical disturbances Water movement displaces air from or pulls air into soil Tillage introduces new air Oxidation-Reduction Potential (Eh) Determines direction of redox reactions High, positive Eh provides favorable environment for oxidation Generally correlated with O2 concentration in soils Predominance of oxidized forms in well-aerated soils Waterlogging reduces O2, hence Eh Predominance of reduced forms Microbial activity responsible for much redox activity in soils Redox responsible for many soil color phenomena Oxidizing conditions - predominance of reds due to Fe(III) Reducing conditions - predominance of yellows, grays, blues due to Fe(II)and Mn(II) Mottles - due to regular changes in redox state over time Soils with fluctuating water tables O2 concentration and O2 diffusion rate (ODR) affect root and top growth Both usually decline with depth Top growth usually suffers first Water and nutrient uptake are generally active processes and require free O2 SOIL TEMPERATURE Soil is heated mainly by solar radiation Soil temperature follows diurnal and seasonal cycles Warms during the day and cools at night Warms in spring and cools later Not always directly synchronized with energy input Warmest in late afternoon Peak temperature occurs before canopy closure Soil can be heated or cooled by rainfall Rate of heating depends on color, wetness, slope aspect, cover Rate of cooling depends on sky, air temp, cover, wetness Soil heats and cools from the top down Time lags in temperature across profile Modifying soil temperature Drainage Mulching Clear v. colored SOIL CHEMISTRY A mole is 1.",1.171168565750122]]
