Chinese bells, freedom for what is now deemed an autonomous region urged by a balding man in glasses adorned with orange robes, dressed to kill meaning wearing a military uniform, a painted bride, a powerful tale from another millennium, effortless, or disguised as a pear, free of whiteness, a protested war nonetheless even though that point of view largely remains unheard, as if an egg were adorned with glitters of color and wrapped in streamers of bright paper, announcing a free ride, child's hand reaching for rising balloon, fears the morning, mechanically strummed while waiting for gender, eyes wide and amazed, to be learned while watching someone so small, fire as a tool for keeping winter on the run, The History of Western Philosophy being the title of a performance, strained

edition of his words, your only commitment to the coast, sturdy, collecting her things before leaving to spend more time walking in a green world, acknowledging violence, formed slowly near the beginning of the experiment, held in one's palm 13 not to blow up the moon, great taste made affordable, her military sinews translated into male terms, like a desert with its craters and seas that seemed ancient, ample, malformed but not cognizant, who are skilled in the lessons of seduction, smiled madly into the heat, from a center not the other way around, comfortable with guns, not the way teaching began, with black fog, spoken while running on a court audible to a few, champing at the bitten fruit not another piece of pie that brought all this upon us, child indicating rain, not dyed or injected with perfume, simultaneity as an aspect of ritual but not prefigured as were the bombing runs, boring no one, layers of color not entirely distinct from one another, with every egg keeping less yeast, foreign, offering forgiveness to blue oceans, into an enclosure, where we began as in cut and past until he repeats himself or discovers another presence, crossed out, attending a funeral in which the deceased had never been identified, change of shoes, form an old book which had sat upon a shelf for more than a decade but never lost as in the way the river turns into the earth, the \ngrandmothers, not upset with all the destruction, a parental attitude nearly always a mistake in diplomacy, over the border where we miss them very much, a recognized postmark, birth toward waiting for substance, not to begin another, issues walking, technical information disguising the blood, arrangements of fork and spoon as indicators of integrity, not the wine, always more print than person, descending as a gift, on a train sleeping through Pennsylvania where the early morning woods contributed silver, struggling to be brown or not at all 14 and plenty of breathing, plethora of blue jays,

aggression as if it were not really about money and the smell, satisfied, announced but not forthcoming, trying to equate dollars with the possibility of words, ashen-faced, not attended as a parade, a cry from the next room child awakening from early afternoon nap in green, the care with which, clipping cat's claws after an incident with dog, eloping, denying the rain as if desert stays where it began forming crystals fine dust settles, asking not more than is necessary, in a blue shirt changing, that shape erotic even when not visible through the wall to the next room, she said, loaded with books to publish and a lack of money, thirty years how many words might that be tomorrow or then, a light illuminating upwards through dispersal, black dog wrapped in toward herself sleeping, the smell of an oven cleaning itself not napalm or wasn't that a different war this one much cleaner so they said, portraying a land mass as noun, green house with red roof and blue door she made, unable to speak, not a thing a sentence, masking a truth but only one, framed, two ears as though ready, a still line even when judged, driving in snow, imagined as furnishings in bright colors could there be a lake there as well, a small hole in the fabric 15 marking time as a veil through which a voice makes an entrance softly or not at all, black dog with eyes closed, allowing a dare, book divided

line in the water and retrieved by a fish to be, sparked with lights but not electric to the skin, not removed but restated, her witness taking the shape of kiss unresolved, a tension assuming

large crystals (few nuclei) &#9;rapid - small crystals (many nuclei) &#9;instantaneous - glass (no arrangement of ions in solid) 3 Page 4 CRYSTALLIZATION OF MAGMA Factors affecting crystallization: 2) Mineral composition: - basaltic, andesitic &amp; granitic &#9;determines the temperature of crystallization and together with the rate of cooling determines the crystal size (igneous texture) 3) Amount of volatiles - allows for greater mobility of ions (large amounts -

textures refers to the size, shape and arrangement of minerals that make up a rock - the rate of cooling is the most important control on textures 6 Page 7 MODE OF ORIGIN and IGNEOUS TEXTURES Intrusive Origin - slow cooling of magma deep below the surface - large crystals Texture - phaneritic - grains are large enough to be seen without the aid of a microscope Extrusive Origin - lava cools at the surface or magma cools near the surface - rapid cooling resulting in small crystals Texture - aphanitic - grains too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope (i.e. it can not be seen with the naked eye) 7 Page 8 MODE OF ORIGIN and IGNEOUS TEXTURES Intrusive and Extrusive Origin - slow cooling deep below the surface - later rapid magma movement towards the surface - large crystals form during deep slow cooling, and small crystals formed during shallow rapid cooling implied here is a Two-Stage Cooling History Texture - porphyritic - large crystals (phenocryst) embedded in a matrix of smaller crystals (groundmass) 8 Page 9 MODE OF ORIGIN and IGNEOUS TEXTURES Instantaneous Cooling Texture - glassy - when lava is quenched instantly, rapid cooling generate no crystals leading forming glass e.g. obsidian Texture -
