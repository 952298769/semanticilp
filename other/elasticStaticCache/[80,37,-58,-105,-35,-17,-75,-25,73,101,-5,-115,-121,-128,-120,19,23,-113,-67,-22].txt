Hemoglobin molecule is a complex protein structure that carries oxygen and carbon dioxide through the blood stream It consists of four polypeptides: 2 alpha and 2 beta chains Each of these

nucleotides in the DNA Each beta chain consists of 146 Amino Acids, requiring a sequence of 438 nucleotides in the DNA Hemoglobin Genes Hemoglobin Loci Developmental Changes in Hemoglobin Mutation Even small changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA can have significant repercussions in terms of protein structure and function Changes can involve single nucleotides or large groups of nucleotides The result of mutation is determined by what it does to the protein structure Sickle Cell Anemia Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition caused by a point mutation: the change in one nucleotide within the sequence of 438 bases coding for the hemoglobin beta chain The shift in the 17th nucleotide from a Thymine base to an Adenine base causes a shift in the 6th amino acid from

populations Mitochondrial Eve scenario suggests modern man comes from Africa, ~200,000 years ago Chromosomes Chromosomes are the complex DNA and Protein units that carry the genetic code in all cells with nuclei In sexually-reproducing organisms, chromosomes come in homologous pairs Each member of the pair contains information on how to build the same protein products One member of each pair comes from the mother and one comes from the father Karyotype A Karyotype is a photomicrograph of the chromosomal complement of an individual The chromosomes are arranged according to size, and numbered,

chromosome for Males Approximately 100,000 genetic loci on the 23 pairs of chromosomes Locus The position of a gene on an homologous chromosome pair is known as a Locus The locus of the beta gene for the Hemoglobin molecule is near the tip of the short arm of chromosome number 11 The locus of the alpha gene is near the tip of the short arm of chromosome number 16 Alleles Many genes have different forms We discussed two forms of the gene for Hemoglobin, the normal form called type A, and the mutant variety that results in sickle cell, type S These variants of a particular gene are called Alleles Genotype vs. Phenotype Genotype is the genetic makeup of an individual This usually refers to what alleles an individual has at a specific locus e.g., at the ABO locus, one A allele, one O allele Phenotype is the observable expression of the genotype The phenotype for the above genotype would be Blood Type A. Homozygous If an individual has two of the same alleles at a particular locus, he is said to be homozygous ( \nor is a homozygote) A person is homozygous if he inherits a Hemoglobin S allele from both his mother and father Genotype: HbS/ HbS Phenotype: Sickle Cell Anemia Heterozygous If an individual has two different alleles at a particular locus, he is said to be heterozygous (or is a heterozygote) A person is heterozygous if he inherits a Hemoglobin S allele from his mother and a Hemoglobin A allele from his father Genotype: HbS/ HbA Phenotype: Sickle Cell Trait (Carrier) Dominant and Recessive Alleles are said to be dominant or recessive depending upon whether they are expressed (dominant) or hidden (recessive) in heterozygotes In the ABO system, A and B alleles are dominant over O, and co-dominant with each other (Blood type AB) O is recessive to both A and B Gregor Mendel Augustinian Monk Determined that the nature of inheritance was particulate (genes) Published findings in 1865 Was unknown until 1900 Mendelian Genetics An individual can have two different types of genes for a particular characteristic and only express one type Example: ABO blood type system, if you have both an A type gene and an O type gene, your blood type is A, and your blood functions as blood type A Mendelian Genetics Law of Segregation Genes occur in pairs (because chromosomes occur in pairs, one from the mother and one from the father) During meiosis, chromosome pairs separate so that each gamete contains one member of each pair Each gamete has an equal (50-50) chance of containing a particular maternal or paternal chromosome (randomness) Mendelian Genetics Law of Independent Assortment Alleles that govern one trait sort into gametes independently of the alleles for other traits--providing they are on separate chromosomes Chance governs which pairs of alleles from loci on separate chromosomes are found in any given gamete Independent Assortment The ABO locus is on chromosome 9, the Rhesus (Rh) locus in on chromosome 1 These two factors are transmitted independent of one another Phenotype (Blood type): A+ Genotype: A/O +/- Gametes: A/+ A/-",1.3178479671478271],["Generally, only one gene of each pair will need to be expressed in a particular cell.",1.3142836093902588],["Each parent has a gene pair in each cell for each trait studied.",1.3142836093902588],["The pair-rule genes are separated from one another by non-expressing cells.",1.3142836093902588],["In humans, genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, located in the cell nucleus.",1.3142836093902588],["When a Ras gene pairs with a \"good\" protein, cell growth will be normal.",1.3142836093902588],["There are estimated to be about 100,000 genes on the 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in each cell.",1.3142836093902588],["Human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes containing 100,000 to 200,000 genes.",1.3142836093902588],["All genes within a cell come in pairs - one contributed by each parent.",1.3142836093902588],["Genes are made of DNA and are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, located in the cell nucleus.",1.3142836093902588],["When combined, the letters (AS) refer to the pair of genes that result in sickle cell trait.",1.3142836093902588],["Law of Segregation : During gamete (sex cells) formation gene pairs separate.",1.3142836093902588],["Genes are part of the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in human cells.",1.3142836093902588],["Because different pairs of keratin genes are turned on in different cell layers .",1.3142836093902588],["Genes that control various traits are located on pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus of the cells.",1.3142836093902588],["The sex cells carry only one member of each pair of genes.",1.3142836093902588],["Genes are carried on paired structures called chromosomes which lie in the nuclei of cells.",1.3142836093902588]]
