sink) Salinity--typically about 35 , mostly chlorine (19.4 ) and sodium (10.8 ) Density--increases with decreasing temperature &amp; increasing salinity Thermocline--temperature profile caused by solar radiation and water density Thermocline creates the SOFAR channel which confines sound waves Surface (horizontal) Circulation (relatively fast) Driven by surface winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) Controlled by Coriolis Effect and continental barriers Gyres circulate clockwise in northern hemisphere, CCW in S. hemisphere Gulf Stream and similar currents are \"rivers in the ocean\" Eddies north of Gulf Stream Eddies south of Gulf Stream Spin clockwise Spin counterclockwise Warm water cores Cold water cores Stay at surface Sink deep Low in nutrients &amp; life High in nutrients &amp; life Deep (vertical) Circulation (very slow) Driven by differences in water density (due to temperature and salinity) Vertical circulation is often blocked by the thermocline Deep upwelling near poles, shallow upwelling along coasts and at equator Upwelled waters contain nutrients and have high biological productivity Mediterranean Sea water circulates horizontally due to its high salinity Chapter 15: Marine and Nearshore Environments Oceanic Zones Epicontinental Seas--shallow continental arms of the sea (i.e. Hudson Bay) Continental Shelves--shallow flooded edges of continents (i.e. North Sea) Shelf Break--edge of continent where shelf drops off toward deep ocean floor Continental Slope--steep incline, cut by numerous submarine canyons Continental Rise--area of deep-sea fans and turbidite \ndeposits from Slope Abyssal Plains--deep flat areas of the ocean floor covered with clays and oozes Trenches--deepest zones of the ocean, correspond to tectonic subduction zones Transgressions--rises in sea level that flood more of the continents Regressions--drops in sea level that expose formerly covered continental areas Coastal Zones of the United States (from north to south) Glacial Erosion--many fjords and islands with hard bedrock (coast of Maine) Glacial Deposition--peninsulas and islands made of glacial till (Cape Cod) Estuaries--drowned river valleys cut by glacial runoff (Chesapeake bay) Barrier islands &amp; lagoons--stable coasts south of glacially-effected areas Mangrove swamps--lagoons warm enough to support mangrove trees Features of Barrier Island/Lagoon Sequences Brackish water--sea water diluted by river runoff, lower than normal salinity Tidal channels--cuts through barrier islands with flood and ebb tide deltas Salt marshes--quiet coastal marshes with high biologic productivity Coral Reefs : complex shallow water communities supported by a framework Require warm water, strong sunlight, a hard substrate, no sediment input 1) Fringing reefs--initial reefs attached directly to volcanic oceanic island 2) Barrier reefs--reefs separated from an island by a lagoon due to subsidence 3) Atolls--isolated rings of reef from which a former island has submerged Chapter 16: Earth Resources Renewable Resources--part of geologic cycles, in ever-existing supply Non-renewable Resources--available in limited quantities, non-regenerating Water (Renewable) Renewable resource but in a limited supply in desert areas Resource can be destroyed by pollution and salt water incursion Desalination or other processing sometimes necessary to make water useful Raw Materials (Non-renewable) Geologic Concentration Processes: Hydrothermal precipitation--Copper, gold, lead, galena, sphalerite Igneous cooling--feldspar, quartz, lithium, diamonds (from pegmatites) Metamorphism--garnet, talc Evaporation--salt, gypsum, borax Soil leaching--aluminum (from bauxite) Placer sorting--gold, silver, platinum, diamonds Precambrian anoxic environments--iron (from Banded Iron Formations) Metallic vs. Non-metallic resources Underground mining vs. strip mining of ore Some uses of Earth Resources: Building/road materials: quarried rock, gravel, sand, limestone, gypsum Metals: gold, silver, platinum, copper, iron, lead, aluminum, zinc, etc. Abrasives: diamonds, corundum, diatomite Ceramics: clay minerals Fuel: coal, petroleum, natural gas, coal, uranium Gemstones: diamond, corundum, beryl, garnet, topaz, zircon, etc. Energy Resources Non-renewable Fossil fuels (85% of current energy use) Coal--compressed &amp; altered plant remains, must be mined Petroleum &amp; natural gas--kerogen migrates upward into traps Oil shale &amp; tar sands--potentially minable petroleum Nuclear energy (8%)--Uranium is mined for use as nuclear fuel Renewable Hydroelectric power (5%)--electric generation from dammed rivers Geothermal energy (1%)--heat energy from hot spots in earth's crust Biomass energy--burning of food waste, garbage, ethanol, etc. Solar energy--useful for direct heating or electric generation Wind energy--useful in areas with continuous strong winds Tidal, wave, current, &amp;
