Respiratory System Introduction Respiration is the act of breathing: inhaling (inspiration): muscle contraction , which lifts the ribs and pulls them outward, increases lung volume, allowing air to rush in (inspired air contains 21% oxygen and essentially no carbon dioxide) Audio recording: Lung Sounds exhaling (expiration) - muscle relaxation decreases lung volume and the air passively flows out (expired air contains 16% oxygen and 4.5% carbon dioxide) The respiratory system functions to deliver the oxygen to the blood -- the transport medium of the cardiovascular system -- and to remove
