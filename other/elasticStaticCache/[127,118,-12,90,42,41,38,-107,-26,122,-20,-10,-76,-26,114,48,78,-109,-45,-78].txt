the earth's oceans (the moon) 200 When the moon appears to be a bright circle, it is in this phase (full moon) 300 Day and night are caused by this movement of the earth (rotation around the sun) 400 The earth takes one year to make one of these around the sun (revolution) 500 Seasons are caused by the earth's revolution around the sun and by this (the tilt of the earth) Simple Machines 100 A ramp is an example of this type of simple machine (inclined plane) 200 This makes raising a flag up a flagpole much easier (pulley) 300 A screw is actually one of these wrapped around a post (inclined

change when the objects become smaller (shape, color, etc) 400 The smallest part of any material (atom) 500 These tiny particles made of combinations of atoms make every object unique (molecules) Energy 100 Light and heat energy are provided for the earth by this (the sun) 200 Two examples of natural forms of energy (sunlight, water, or wind) 300 The lights in your classroom use this type of energy (electricity) 400 Types of energy which we can never use up are this type of resource (renewable) 500 Coal, oil and natural gas are examples of this type of fuel (fossil fuels) Double Jeopardy Metric System 200 Your finger is about as wide as one of these (centimeter) 400 100 meters makes one of these (kilometer) 600 A large bottle of soda might be measured by these (liters) 800 The type of clothing you would probably wear when the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius (shorts, tee shirt, etc.) 1000 The mass of an object is measured using this unit of measurement (gram) Animal Habitats 200 Cactus and scorpions might live in this habitat (desert) 400 Alligators probably live here (swamp, marshlands) 600 These are being destroyed at an alarming rate each year (rain forests) 800 Zebras and lions probably enjoy this type of environment (grasslands) 1000 The type of habitat one might find in northern Canada and Russia (tundra) Food Chain 200 The major source of energy for all living things (sun) 400 Anything which can make its own food (producer) 600 An animal that hunts and eats other animals (predator) 800 These help break down plants and animals into simpler matter

this each winter (hibernate) 600 Animals that look like more dangerous animals use this behavior (mimicry) 800 Behaviors that animals are born knowing how to do (instinct) 1000 A dog which comes to you when you whistle demonstrates this type of behavior (learned behavior) Natural Disasters 200 This natural disaster affected thousands of acres in Yellowstone National Park (fire) 400 Heavy rains can cause these natural disasters (floods) 600 The earth appears to split during one of these (earthquake) 800 These eruptions can burn the plants in the path of the lava flow (volcanoes) 1000 Wind
