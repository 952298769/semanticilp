However, maximizing fuel efficiency is also not what actual cyclists do. In fact, the hard cyclist deliberately chooses to pedal considerably faster than the most oxygen-efficient cadence to avoid getting tired. In short, fatigue is delayed by working harder and burning more calories! This works because even though force and speed are interchangeable in producing mechanical power in machines, their effects are not physiologically equivalent. The runner cannot trade off muscle force for muscle speed, because the muscles must support the body's weight: however, the bicycle enables a person to outsmart nature.
