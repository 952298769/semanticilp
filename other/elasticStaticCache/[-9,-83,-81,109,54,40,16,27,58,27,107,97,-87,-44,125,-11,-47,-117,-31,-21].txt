Electrical energy-->light energy-->sound energy it's the process of changing energy frm one form to another one .",2.6500208377838135],["When electricity is forced through a resistor, often the energy in the electricity is changed into another form of energy, such as light or heat.",2.6447978019714355],["When electricity is forced through a resistor, often the energy in the electricity is changed into another form of energy, such as light or heat.",2.6447978019714355],["Chemical Energy → Electrical Energy → Mechanical Energy → Electrical Energy",2.643176794052124],["Chemical Energy → Electrical Energy → Mechanical Energy → Electrical Energy",2.643176794052124],["Electrical Energy → Heat and Light Energy",2.641111373901367],["Electrical Energy → Heat and Light Energy",2.641111373901367],["Electrical Energy → Heat and Light Energy",2.641111373901367],["Electrical Energy → Heat and Light Energy",2.641111373901367],["These convert light energy into electrical energy.",2.641111373901367],["These convert light energy into electrical energy.",2.641111373901367],["An electrochemical cell converts chemical energy into a) chemical energy b) light energy c) electrical energy d) nuclear energy 13.",2.6294455528259277],["An electrochemical cell converts chemical energy into a) chemical energy b) light energy c) electrical energy d) nuclear energy 13.",2.6294455528259277],["Electrical circuits provide a means of transferring electrical energy when heat, light, sound, and chemical changes are produced.
