[["X1013070084-00230-61503</DOCNO> Grade Level 5 GRADE LEVEL 5 Weather (Atmosphere) (CS 4) Students will be able to: Relate observed weather conditions to different climates and seasons Investigate different stages in the water cycle (melting, freezing, and evaporation, and condensation) Observe and describe weather conditions such as clouds, temperatures, air pressure, and precipitation Identify events \nin nature that have repeating patterns or cycles, (e.g. weather patterns, water cycle) Compare and contrast the various types of common clouds Relate observed weather conditions to different climates and seasonal changes Interpret and summarize long term weather data Organize weather data on graphs and long term data collection charts Renewable and Non-renewable Resources (CS 4) Students will be able to: Identify/explain such effects human activities have on the atmosphere Ecology (CS 3) Students will be able to: Classify a variety of organisms based on their characteristics, and use this scheme as a tool to organize information about the diversity of life forms Describe/identify random differences between individuals of the same species of plant or animal (e.g. students can examine parts of plants of the same species and recognize variations, and can construct graphs and charts showing the variations) Create examples of food chains and webs in several types of ecosystems (e.g. deciduous forest, fresh water, desert, etc.) Demonstrate a basic knowledge of the process of photosynthesis and its importance for all life forms Identify and describe the basic requirements for sustaining life (e.g. plants and animals need food for energy and growth) Conduct an investigation which illustrates how the environment affects the viability of plants or animals within that environment Describe and give examples of the various types of interactions that occur among organisms (e.g. predator-prey, symbiotic, producer-consumer-decomposer, host-parasite) to demonstrate how organisms compete or cooperate with each other to gain food, resources or space Identify and describe examples of New Hampshire animals and plants that live together in one ecosystem (e.g. forest, seashore, lake, river) Identify common materials that cycle through the environment (e.g. carbon, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, etc.) Explore through models, experiments, and observations how matter and energy interact in any ecosystem Describe how organisms can acquire energy directly or indirectly from the energy of the sun Describe similarities and differences between single celled and multicellular organisms (e.g. cell structures) Observe and describe major characteristics of various life forms (e.g. microorganisms, fungi, protists, plants, animals) Compare and contrast life processes in plants and animals (e.g. growth and development, nutrition, reproduction, etc.) Explore the adaptive relationships of animals and plants to their habitats (e.g. life in a pine cone, effects of pollution on different species, etc.) Name and describe the five kingdoms of living things Conduct an investigation which demonstrates the effect of one or more environmental factors on the viability of a plant or animal (e.g. set up a small freshwater ecosystem in an aquarium, observe the ecosystem and keep records of physical factors and the effects on all living organisms Matter (CS 5) Students will be able to: Describe objects in terms of the materials of which they are made (clay, cloth, paper) and their physical properties (color, size, shape, mass, texture, flexibility) Describe characteristics of matter that are common to solids and liquids (have mass, take up space), and that distinguish them as different phases of matter Explore how the total mass of an object or device is fixed despite changes in shape (e.g. measure mass of piece of paper before and after being crumpled or shredded or made into an airplane;",0.9337834715843201],["How

Behavior Is Its Survival Value Evolutionary analysis of how behavior helps an animal or its offspring stay alive Example: Tinbergen`s gull experiments fig 55.1 Gull parents remove hatched eggshells from nest If broken shells replaced, predation increased White shell interior cues predators Shell removal behavior is adaptive Behavioral Ecology Study of how natural selection shapes behavior Adaptive significance: how behavior increases survival and reproduction Concentration of early studies Habitat selection Avoiding predation Becoming more effective predator Recent studies examine animal`s fitness or reproductive success How behavior is related to fitness = study of adaptation itself Natural selection acts on genetic component of behavioral differences Behavior favoring reproductive success becomes more prevalent over time Test hypothesis by measuring fitness, demonstrating its correlation with behavior May also measure other factors associated with reproduction FORAGING BEHAVIOR Feeding Is One of Most Basic Animal Behaviors Foraging behavior: involved with selection and collection of food Predators may actively hunt, ambush or trap prey fig 55.2 Specialists Versus Generalists Specialists: feed on only one kind of food Example: some ants eat only spider eggs Example: oystercatchers feed on only mussels fig 55.3 Generalists: feed on many different kinds of food Not as efficient as specialists at catching any one kind of food Take advantage of catching many different varieties Behavior is obviously important to growth and reproduction Target of strong evolutionary forces Expect evolution to favor foraging efficiency Calculate net energy of different prey items, size and energy needed for pursuit Predictions made by optimal foraging theory fig 55.4 Animals cannot always maximize energy intake Nutrition and variety of food must be considered Compromises made because of predation by others fig 55.5 SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Definition of Social Behavior Interaction with others of same or different species May be competitive or cooperative Territorial Behavior Home range: daily activity site May overlap with others in time or space May be exclusive and actively defended Territoriality fig 55.6 Individual exclusively uses area with some limited resource Resources may include food or potential mates Defense of area via displays or overt aggression Economic risks of territorial behavior Energy costs versus energy benefits Example: flowers and nectar-feeding birds fig 55.7 If flowers scarce, not worth defending since they do not provide enough energy If abundant, not worth defending, easy to get enough energy Defense practical for intermediate quantity of flowers The Ecology of Reproduction Reproductive strategies: behaviors that maximize reproductive success Include mate choice, number of mates and parental care Evolved in response to ecology, food resources, nest sites, distribution of potential mates Mate choice first observed by Darwin fig 55.8 Female`s evaluate male`s quality, decide whether or not to mate Superior mates should leave more offspring Parental investment and mate choice Contributions of each parent to raising offspring Estimate energy spent by male and female in offspring care Parent with the greatest cost should make choice for mate Generally female, may be male Depends on cost of parental care Fundamental differences between males and females Size of gametes: egg significantly larger than sperm Nutritional value of gametes: egg more than sperm Care costly to females that gestate and lactate Some males increase cost by collecting food, defending and feeding young Males may show mate choice if they have high parental investment Example: male cricket spermatophore = 30% of body weight Females compete for males Males choose large females to produce more offspring fig 55.9 Reproductive competition and sexual selection Reproductive competition: competitive interactions over access to mates Females frequently mate with largest male May be associated with competition between other males fig 55.10 Few males in population may sire most \nof offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define \"individual\" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by \"queen substance\", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed offspring, watch for predators, defend territory Can reproduce but do not for a period of time Nest with helpers have more offspring tbl 55.1 Helpers are often fledged offspring of those they help Resembles family situation Evolution explained by inclusive fitness concept Vertebrate Alarm Calling Activity of certain individuals benefit group at expense to individual Example: meerkats fig 55.5 Individuals act as sentries for group May give alarm call when predator sighted Draws attention to itself to protect others Behavior seems contrary to own self interest Example: Belding`s ground squirrels Colonies female-based, \nmales not related to any females Females with relatives nearby more likely to sound alarm than females with no kin nearby Alarm calling favors nepotism Socioecology Vertebrate societies have characteristic organization fig 55.22 Examines influence of environment on social organization Factors include food type and predation Example: African weaver birds Forest species fig 55.23a Builds camouflaged solitary nest Monogamous mating Eat insects Savanna species fig 55.23b Nest in colonies in trees Polygynous mating Eat seeds Feeding and nesting depend on area ecology Mating form dependent on feeding and expense of being a parent Sociality in African ungulates correlate with diet HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY Theories of Animal Sociobiology and Human Applications Could readily examine human activities Exhibit kin-selected altruism and reciprocity Show extensive parental care of offspring Possess variety of mating systems Exhibit unevolutionary behaviors like adoption Two Processes Led to Adaptive Change in Human Evolution Biological evolution Primate heritage shared with chimpanzees Include kin-selected and reciprocal altruism Traits are definitely adaptive in non-human primates Cultural evolution Transfer of information needed for survival Nongenetic mode of adaptation Passed from generation to generation by tradition Includes use of tools, shelter construction, marriage practices Difficult to identify biological components of human behavior Study cross-cultural traits May have been affected by natural selection May result from genes fixed in human populations Examples: Most mammals and human species are polygamous Many cultures exhibit same greeting pattern Many biologists resist explaining human behavior in evolutionary terms Has been used in past to support racist, fascist, sexist policies Potential for abuse still exists If behaviors are \"hardwired\" negative behaviors like violence and aggression cannot easily be changed Human behavior is affected by innate and learned components Study of human behavior will continue to be provocative [Return to Chapter 55 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to Biology Home Page] Search | How to Order | E-mail

Chordata Part V: Birds characteristics of birds birds have the most, obvious characteristics setting them apart as a group they ALL have these three characters with no exceptions feathers lay eggs - oviparous forelimbs are wings - usually used for flight endothermic and to some degree homeothermic once flying birds evolved - the ability to fly and the adaptive zone of the air has governed their subsequent evolution keeping birds from changing very much origin of birds the relationship between reptiles and birds has long been known feathers are modified scales - form from the same cell types during embryogenesis scales still present on epidermis of lower hindlimbs real tie came in 1861 with discovery of Archaeopteryx - (meaning ancient wing) this fossil bore the unmistakable imprint of feathers the origin of feathers has been debated a lot one theory is that they originally evolved as a way to aid in regulating body temperature later - wings evolved due to alterations in the expression of Hox genes similar alterations occurred with the Pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) and mammals (bats) by already having feathers, the early lineages of birds could readily take to flight Class Aves two original groupings flightless - ratite sternum is flat flying - carinate sternum forms a keel now realize that not all flightless birds fit into ratite category and vice versa modern classification is based on the way the palate is formed and whether it remains jointed and flexible or is a fused joint and inflexible Superorder Paleognathae inflexible fused palate most are flightless birds - ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, emus, and kiwis Superorder Neognathae - jointed, flexible palate 22 orders refer to orders in text and in lab manual know the orders in the lab manual

hooks which keep them fastened tightly together to form a mess bone structure all the bones of birds are very porous this makes them extremely light yet maintains strength vertebrae are fused except

groups of organisms are grouped together based on their similarities Carolus Linnaeus developed the idea of binomial nomenclature which is still used although not with the names he originally proposed Purposes of taxonomy provide an unambiguous identification for each organism provides a way of understanding the relationships among diverse species Methods of taxonomy comparative biology compares characteristics of organisms characteristics can be anatomical - presence of limbs, head, different organs, body cavity cellular - presence of types of cells or tissues, presence of organelles reproductive modes - lays egg, live birth molecular - presence of types of genes, sequences genes organisms are named and grouped based on defined sets of characteristics groups start small with organisms which are the only ones possessing a trait - species groups are then put together to form larger groups which have more characteristics in common - genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom - these groups are called taxa Phylogeny the evolutionary relationship among different taxa sort of a family tree early taxonomic schemes predated the concept of evolution and/or modern biochemical techniques used for comparisons this resulted in groupings of organisms which weren&#146;t correctly organized with respect to their evolutionary origins there is currently a lot of research into taxonomy and phylogeny using new molecular tools Characteristics used to construct phylogenies shared traits - synapomorphies traits which all members of a group under consideration share i.e. chordates - all have a notochord during sometime in their life cycle i.e. birds - all have feathers there are characteristics which are homologous between groups of organism homologous characteristics are those which share a common evolutionary origin limbs of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals homologous structures have very similar embryonic origins there are also similar characteristics which are not homologous structures i.e. wings in insects and wings in birds these are non-homologous structures although they perform the same function - flight since these structure perform the same task, flight, they are referred to as orthologous structures derived characteristics those characteristics which are only present in the group of animals being studied ancestral characteristics those present both in the group being studied and in other groups the idea is that ancestral characters would be those found in direct ancestors of the group under consideration a derived character for one group can be an ancestral character for another, more advanced group the arrangement of groups based on synapomorphy of derived characters is hierarchical How do we 1 st determine what characteristics should be used to then determine phylogeny traits determined by methods already described chief among these is molecular biology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology molecular biology sequences of rRNA and mitochondrial DNA comparative embryology - recapitulation to understand how adult structures arise and their potential relationships as homologous structures modern developmental biologist have found that the same genes are used to govern the embryogenesis of all vertebrates and even many invertebrates comparative anatomy study of body plans of animals Phylogenic divisions of life Two broadest divisions prokaryotes - single celled organisms without nuclei or membrane bound organelles eukaryotes - single and multicellular organisms which contain nuclei in cells 5 major divisions or Kingdoms of living things Monera - prokaryotic organisms Protista - unicellular or colonial groups of unicellular organisms Fungi - molds, fungi &amp; \nyeasts (uni- or multicellular organisms) Plantae - multicellular organisms usually autotrophs Animalia - multicellular, usually heterotrophs Body plans of the major Animalia and Protista Phyla Unicellular Multicellular cell aggregates diploblastic organisms formation of two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm) - radial symmetry triploblastic animals formation of three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) bilateral symmetry protostomes - oral opening forms first near the blastopore acoelomate - no cavity between germ layers - flatworms pseudocoelomate - the cavity between the mesoderm and ectoderm forms from the blastocoel coelomates - the body cavity forms from inside the mesoderm, the mesoderm therefore surrounds the coelom unsegmented body - mollusca segmented body - annelids, arthropods deuterostomes - oral opening forms second after anal opening which forms near the blastopore all deuterostomes are coelomates - have a true coelom bilateral embryos, secondarily radial adults bilaterally symmetrical adults, endoskeleton Multicellularity colonial vs. true multicellular colonial multiple identical cells living communally volvox multicellularity different types of cells cells can be either arranged by types (tissues) or uniformly dispersed through out organism - cell aggregates Germ layers, tissues, and organs multiple cell types are usually generated sequentially by inductive events - one cell type can cause the formation of new cell types through their interactions germ layers arise from inherent differences in regions of the egg - primordial ectoderm and endoderm secondary inductions between the endoderm and ectoderm create the mesoderm in triploblastic animals called germ layers because they are actually layers of tissue - ecto -outside, endo- inside, meso - middle germ because they give rise to many different cell types later during embryogenesis interactions between these primary germ layers (cell types) give rise to all other cell types ecto + endo = meso ecto + meso = neural neural + ecto = eye/ear meso + endo = internal organs like blood vessels meso + ecto + endo = internal organs like liver, lungs etc&#133; organization of

means that they remain different, without mixing together hypothetical bird example A single population: a population of finches live on an island the island has two areas, one wet and one dry selection favors large beaks in the dry area, and small beaks in the wet area but the finches fly all around the island and interbreed with each other so the birds all are members of a single population although more large-beaked birds survive in the dry area, and more small-beaked birds survive in the wet area, they all mate with each other at random and mix up all their genes in the next generation so the beaks in the next generation are an average, intermediate size the population average does not change, and all the birds remain roughly the same - a single species now imagine that a different species of bird also lives on the island it has a long, narrow beak and a long tongue suited for picking insects out of tree bark the two species of birds share the island, but do not mate with each other: they are reproductively isolated from each other no matter how useful it might be to have a long, narrow beak and tongue and eat insects, the finches will never get these traits from the bug-eating birds the gap between the two species remains clear the finches remain finches, and the bug-eaters remain bug-eaters because they are reproductively isolated from each other the point of the example according to the biological species concept, it is gene flow within the species that keeps all members of the species fairly similar and it is reproductive isolation from other species that allows each species to be different from all others, because no mixing between species occurs a note about reproductive isolation populations may be reproductively isolated in many different, often subtle ways in the most obvious case, they may be so different that they physically cannot mate, or that even if they do, the offspring do not survive or are not fertile but isolation is just as complete if they simply do not mate for some other reason for example, if one population is active in the day, and the other at night or if two populations of birds develop preferences for different colors of feathers, and the birds only choose mates of their own type even though they could be made to successfully mate in a lab or on a farm, if they do not mate in nature, they are effectively isolated The ecological species concept \"A species is a group of organisms that is genetically distinct from other species because any hybrids between species are markedly less successful\" This is a much less common, somewhat radical view but it is worth looking at The ecological species concept says that what keeps all the members of the species similar to each other is not gene flow, but rather stabilizing selection because the selective pressures that created the species in the first place will tend to keep each population the same (stabilizing selection) that is, even if a species is divided into physically isolated populations and there is no gene flow between them, the two populations will still remain the same because they are experiencing the same stabilizing selection pressures the species remain different from other species because if individuals from two different species do successfully mate and produce offspring the offspring will have a mixture of traits that will be less well adapted.",0.5999618172645569],["Characteristics The main feathers of this bird are an iridescent bronze color with black tips.",0.5997122526168823],["It looked like a primary flight
