From October through April, some snails will hibernate. A snail’s diet includes such things as leaves, plants, fruit, mushrooms, stems, soft bark, etc [20] . Though it is rare, some snails have been found to be carnivorous or omnivorous [21] .Snails have many predators in the wild. They are in danger of attack from many vertebrates (salamanders, shrews, etc.), beetles, leeches, and even predatory snails and caterpillars. Firefly larvae prey upon snails. Birds like the thrush, grouse and other ground foragers eat terrestrial snails. Parasites are also a big problem for snails. Snails are very important in the cycling of calcium. All snails need calcium carbonate which they get from plants and, when they are eaten, pass it along the food chain. But calcium isn't the only thing snails pass along. Snails are intermediate hosts of all sorts of parasites, including the sheep liver fluke (Porch, pg. 458). Snails play a small role in decomposition, though not as much as other animals. Snails even have medicinal uses. Anti-agglutinin is made from the albumin glands of Helix aspersa. Every gardener knows the problem posed by snails.
