Weathering and erosion weathering is the breaking down of a rock or mineral material weathering can be chemical or physical click here to see page 115(126) and chemical weathering of a stone monument--note the pitting stream water, wind and glacial ice are important transportation agents an important product of weathering and erosion is soil--weathering and erosion acting together can form some spectacular landforms as Bryce Canyon in Utah click here to see page 108(121) and Bryce Canyon I. Surface streams and groundwater these are 2 very important sources of municipal water there are pollution problems associated with these which we will consider later in the semester---pollution sources as landfills, factories, septic tanks, etc. also important erosional and depositional features associated with these will be treated in detail such as caves and stalactites click here to see page 266(286) and cave deposits important features as sinkholes formed from the action of groundwater can cause structural failure of buildings and considerable surface collapse click here to see a large sinkhole J. Glaciers some depositional features caused by glaciers are important in the cement and concrete industries during the \"Great Ice Age\" of North America glaciers cut the basin of the Great Lakes and was the source of much of the lake water click here to see page 297(318) and the extent of global ice cover during \"Great Ice Age\" the glacial ice of Greenland and Antarctica comprises about 96% of all global ice and if all of the ice melted sea level would rise about 215 feet which means any coastal land presently below 215 feet elevation would be submerged K. Earthquakes seismology is the study of earthquakes the New Madrid Fault area in southeast Missouri produced one of the largest earthquakes in history in the early 19th century--a possibility of large earthquakes happening in the future in this area is high tsunami is a sea wave produced by an earthquake--these features have produced major damage in the past click here for seismic information click here for tsunami information return to home page You are visitor [Hit Counter] as of 10/03/99 photos click to return page 12 click to return page 135 click to return page 23 click to return volcanic eruption click to return page 13 click to return page 14 click to return page 421 click to return page 20 click to return page 115 click to return page 108 click to return page 266 click to return a large sinkhole click to return page 297 click to return",1.1627496480941772],["Soil and rock are always on the move through weathering, erosion, gravity, and the lateral movement of the earth's continents and ocean floors.",1.160868525505066],["Sedimentary and Metamorphic Rocks Weathering and Erosion;",1.160078525543213],["The natural process of Erosion is the wearing down and moving of rocks and soil from one place to another.",1.1540074348449707],["This has occurred because the rock composing the dike is harder and more resistant to weathering and erosion than the rocks surrounding the dike.",1.1521484851837158],["Here on the surface the cement of the sandstone is dissorved and the saturated rock is prone to weathering and erosion.",1.1505011320114136],["SEDIMENTARY ROCKS Sedimentary Rocks -
