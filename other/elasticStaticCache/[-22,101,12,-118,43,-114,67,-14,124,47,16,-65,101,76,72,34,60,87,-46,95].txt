Boston Review: the noise of time the noise of time i suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.8314587473869324],["X1011586443-00045-12112</DOCNO> Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Artist Elton John Album Goodbye Yellow Brick

C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Happy Meals The holiday meals were special too with many good things that I knew were just for that wonderful day when I would hear my Grandma say \"Eat it all and do not waste this food we share of special taste that we won't enjoy for another year\" that was such a long time I did fear The everyday meals that we all shared by Mom and Grandma they were prepared the time to eat was always the same the time when to the table we all came At supper time in the fall of the year I could see reflections almost clear in the large windows covered with steam that made this setting look like a dream That place of shelter from the outside cold in that ten room house so big, so bold the many meals we shared with pleasure the memories of these is a true treasure &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gathering By The Hearth The fire place that glowed with heat when you sat up close it warmed your feet it was only lit for special reasons such as the wonderful holiday seasons On Thanksgiving night or Christmas day I would hear my Father say \"go down to the cellar and bring some wood so we may build a fire warm and good\" The fire would flicker then it would rise to become so grand right before our eyes it lit up the room and our spellbound faces casting our shadows in the corners and spaces of that very large room where we congregated while all who gathered patiently waited for the final treat of the holiday season as you will see, we had very good reason When the fire burned down to coals we would make pop corn, many bowls but the treat I loved as a little fellow was to roast on a stick my own marshmallow until it was toasted golden brown a better treat could not be found I would eat three or four my Mom would say \"enough, no more\" Then I was off to my very own bed while visions of marshmallows danced in my head to lay there happy as a boy could be waiting for the next train you see to come from the east or the west this time of night was always the best the sound of the whistle drawing near left me at peace as I did hear the steam engine so big, so strong that lulled me to sleep before long to dream of what tomorrow held for me in dreams that were only mine to see &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Rainy Day Place On the many days when the weather was bad I was blessed with a treasure few have had a great chasm beneath my home where I could run, play and roam The cellar was exciting in many ways I had much fun there, I must say enjoying the games that my dog and I would play on a snow blown night or a rainy day I can not remember all of them from the days I was less than ten I do remember quite a few listen closely now, as I share them with you My friends and I played hide and seek from our hiding places we would peek so quiet, so still we all would sit until we were found by the one who was it Haunted house we would play at night after turning out each and every light the hot water tank gave off a light of blue that made this place look strange and new we would sneak around in this place so dim if someone came close we jumped out at him he would yell and jump up off the floor we all would laugh and play some more &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My Favorite Toy An electric train, the best toy I had was mounted on wood by me and my Dad where we built the country and a town the little train went round and round we added a bridge and a tunnel too when this tunnel the train did pass through I would look into the other end at night to watch for the engine's little bright light the engine smoked, the whistle blew it had a headlight like real trains do it huffed and puffed up hill very slow then down the other side to town it would go There was a train station in the town where I would slow the train way down then I would stop it for a short time while make believe people aboard did climb I would give the whistle a toot, toot, toot it sounded like a very small flute I'd start the train on it's way down the track it traveled many miles, but it always came back &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pirate Treasure There was an old chest filled with many things we pretended they were gold, jewels and rings to us, my young friends and me a pirates treasure we did see we played pirates with swords made of wood hats made of cloth and paper were good protecting the treasure was our game after giving ourselves very funny names like Peg Leg Pete and One Eyed Joe Jolly Jake and Little Moe we would pretend to have \na big sword fight that lasted the day and into the night Then we would sit down on the cellar stairs a very good treat from my Mom we would share we would talk about the game we had just played we would plan to do it again, another day It seems to me only right that all children behold the sight of a chasm beneath the place where they live to enjoy the fun-filled hours it gives &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Root Cellar In the cellar beneath the house where I did reside over in the corner on the other side there was a place I truly loved to go it held many good things to eat, I want you to know it was a small room in the corner down there filled with many good things to eat and to share it was the root cellar with its dirt floor so neat filled with jars of my Mom's special home-made treats Vegetables and fruits in the fall we did pick Mom cooked them in our kitchen so very quick she placed then in glass jars while they were still hot by the time winter arrived, we had a lot there were many shelves on which you could find sauces and pickles of every kind jars of jams and jellies, row after row and lots of vegetables that made me grow When the wind did howl and the snow did blow down to the cellar I would go and bring up to Mom for our evening feast the best food ever, to say the least the fruits we had picked were a real prize Mom used them to bake tarts and pies when dinner was done and the table was cleared she would bring in the pie as we all cheered On your special day she would bake a cake for you she served it with candles and ice cream too real whipped cream she would pile on top I would eat so much, I just had to stop &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~10~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Missing Boy I remember when I was but four I went out through the open door to walk the distance to the store where Mom and I had gone before I knew the way past seven streets to the place where Mom got all those treats so I ventured out on my own I was four years old, thought I was grown I entered that store through the open door I remember the sound of that old wooden floor I helped myself to a pack of gum I had come here to enjoy, to have some fun I left the store through that same door I settled down on the front porch floor I stuffed in five sticks of that red gum always before, I was allowed only one I settled back to enjoy this treat when my Mother's stare my eyes did meet she jerked me up by my hand she marched me in to see the man She made me spit out that treat so good in front of the man I now stood after saying \"I'm sorry, won't do it again\" she marched me the seven streets and then she made me a harness of some old rope she scolded me and expressed the hope that I would learn from what she had done that I would remember, I was her only son she explained to me something I didn't know that all who searched thought to the lake I did go all our good neighbors searched here and there they could not find me anywhere For two long weeks when outside I could not run far enough to hide for to Mom's cloths line I stayed tied even though I yelled and cried From this I learned lessons true your parents really do love you that stealing from others is very wrong and fighting temptation makes you strong &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Day At Play To sleep through the night hours seven or eight then to the sounds of morning awake to rush down the stairs, by two I leapt for there was no heat in the room where I slept to perch on a register warmed by a fire of coal to settle down with a very large bowl of hot oats covered with cream and sugar so brown a better start to the day could never be found When I was dressed and ready to play I would start out on this brand new day a new adventure I would find with my trusty dog, this pal of mine be he a lion, a horse or a bear my trusty dog was always there to fill my day in a special way he was my best friend, I must say my dog and I played fetch in the yard he was so fast, he worked so hard he protected me with a sharp eye watching closely when strangers walked by Why he loved a bath, heaven only knows he would bark and beg when I got the hose he would run round and round very fast while I sprayed him until he was soaked at last I would wash him with a bar of soap to remove all his fleas was my hope I would dry him with some old rag he'd smile at me as his tail did wag then he would shake from tail to nose and if you were the one he chose right next to you he would come and sit as \nif to ask \"that's all, that's it?\"",0.8263759613037109],["Username: Password: Post as &quot;Anonymous&quot;

friends are we are I and she The devil and I just she and me We talk of this ... we talk of that Yet always laughter breaks our chat We hate each other I and she With a love enduring as none can see 1965 Birth Cursed were sons of yet unborn Cursed were faces still unknown Fiery fountains grief and pain Howling muse is come again Seeing doom around around Seeing masks in sulphur gowned Incestuous combinations sue And crawl from womb in bloody gore Chew the cord and loose the host Of image making whore 1967 Animal Farm Scuttling herds of arrogant cows Parade their wares around the town Cat's skin stinking with rabbity fur But a pat on the arse don't produce no purr Unfeeling eyes of a python's mould Curb the bit on stud stallion's hold Long thin thighs of whippet fame Offer brief chills of the thrashing game 'Our hardened hearts bleakly pursuing A secret place where none can share Face upon face so sour reflecting A naked wish to be elsewhere Unyielded love chews soul destroying That open smile from yesteryear' 1967 Portrait Sudden vision of green and pink little fox tongue chewing on serpent lip Mottled teeth of sharpness acrid pointed each to a cramped mouth Eyes all ginger brown beguiling soft and warm when nature trusted Curved and deviled lashes glinting barely shielding a candle's glow Head all fuzzy bristling sternly unsuppressed by lotion's glue Eyes and chin and nose transparent shimmer shake and curl all through Lips so tight they can give nothing saving hard for years before Bottom bouncing legs a'flashing legs a'swinging to and fro Cheeks all curved and dimpled open nests of fur and sweat bejewelled Softly giving never taking scarce for fear of hurting more Vanished long and long forgotten 'cept in dreams of yestermorn Loved young leaves youthful ever pray senile ashes drag a glow 1967 Poem 1 wattled wippen wylin women claw at sheltered souls to chew and spit the broken meat full fleshed used out the bloody bone Poem 2 Words of electric flicker so rare follow dream so barren cannot care Emptied sombre sound thrilled with moment's flair mourns unyielding the silence of not there 1967 Chances Chances lost and chances taken Castles strong and walls unbroken Strength without of utmost bonds Holding softness weakness chained Freeing none to none unfreeing Holding all to all beholding Breaking each and every one Amongst their dreams 1967 Vision Homecomings heartcomings Long winter night's roamings White snow squelching on the great paved step Bird tracks flecking the dog toed ground Yellow light seeps from our window Where a shaggy black nose squirms Howls for just one chance to place those soft saucers ( in marvellous white snow ) and even chew a rabbit And over all the gentle moon gazing down crispen true through familiar branches climbed each one and dappled now by white snow And the white snow squelching down the path as we set off for the town 1967 Barb I met Shelley this night And he smiled on me For my dream is of right The way life should be The soul floats on love And leaps high to the air Shield it not with a glove In flight soars its flair Joy must take its chance On the barb of the heart Youth is gone in one glance So let hurt play its part When song no more gives Caliban has his say For in truth love lives It's the poets who decay mostly for Browning 1967 Sonnet The heart stirs as a spaniel at stone Leaps a whoops head high in the air That meeting of eye casts a flicker unknown Revealing still thought yet so pure Black bundle of paws bowling all free Charge clean from lusting through nowhere Home smiles clad with a welcoming rag Must unearth some stain somewhere Unease beneath but a bubble on top Untouched unopen unsure For what's beneath should never be taught No pretence but it's always there Living the dream don't look to the side High head intent chasing flare Quickening glance sharp snap try a bite Don't awaken innocence beware 'Let the days come as months And the months come as years For the exposing of depth Marks the roots red with tears' 1967 Monologue Pursuing these plastic statues That writhe and twist in your rhythm Colouring their hair red and their garments green For a devotion My words a solid mask of dullness The spirit fallen The heart broken You you are my life When I know what you are Time stops I live And the heart is so good I do not hold your hand I do not touch you We sit in chairs My legs pointing Yours reticent folded So happy we search each other's eyes And smile and laugh and love Each other I do not touch You do not touch But we dance between our bodies As the laughter takes us And the words flow giving In some dream even taking And the wet brown mist Touches me And we laugh to hide the beautiful pain For our souls skip in the air before us Fragile tender raw Screaming as they \ntouch each other Gay we sit as our silver tongues Caress and cut our secret parts We would give each other everything If we could So instead we give nothing But ripples in the air I dream of holding you loving And your arms unclenched And your head on my shoulder As we hug and squeeze in joy At being together When a part of yourself Lives very far away The little left amuses In drawing happy moments And seeking An eye here a bottom there Help to smooth But never your thrill to the heart Only a shadow's proxy As a moment knows you In some stray face With them At night in the dark I just pretend they're you Then it's alright 1967 Verse The words that race from lips So fast they can't be caught The depths suddenly plumbed When rhythm's lost in thought The knowing all and being all Of vine leaves worn by right Wake the everyday futility Of penetrating night The searching for that reason Through the pursuit of the heart Before innocence is overthrown As the goddess plays a part The oneness of our love When myself returns my sight That experience so exquisite Immortality's bite The chasing down the years Catch the magical in print Before the age old suffering Makes memory extinct Bodies loved must minds unlove Can kisses not unite The meeting of us lovers Cast in virgin light The unknowing of what they do to you The unfeeling of all that hurt Humanity is a stranger race Communication inert Soft dance thru the midst of them Side stepping from their fight Intent on the life's pursuit A dream born by right 1967 Woodlands The lack of a song in the soul Is the cause of a celibate curse The loss of spring in the vine Taints the rhythm of verse The freshness the thrill of before Is repeated as memory plays The records the hope of young heart Relayed thru some innocent face But the fire in the heart is all still The wine to the head no more What was there by right in the past Is dredged from the depths as a chore The pen so easy skips its beat But whereof is its reason Are all singers doomed to play mechanic When love moves on in season Drinking pubs dry is an art my friend To which I have given much attention But when the old body says no more Must seek out a new direction Face the world stick out your chin Go out and sniff at the sun And as for life that wondrous thing Pretend it's just begun Love and women and sex are no good They only cause you pain So be a boy just ten years old And summer come again You and I we played by a stream Watching the horses trot Those were the days of bracken green Before the trees were cut The lawns were great for a croquet bash But I preferred the woods There's something magic there in the green In silence with the rooks Nettles and thistles and midges that sting The smell of a festering pool Are lost in the image of bird in tree Come to conduct his school But the horses best I remember the meet The height of black and pink A chestnut pawing at her bit A silver tankard's clink And the fox we chased along with the car Long hounds stretched in pursuit Low hedges chopping up the hunt As hunters changed their foot And then the fox was away in the wood The hounds had been too slow We weren't to get our taste of the brush Not for a year or so When life's gone foul go back to roots And find who you really are For there is no sense in living out An act for fifty year If you give love then you'll get it back That's what the fates decree And sometimes throw in as bonus The love that none can see But where is the magic to forget the past And repair the damage done Must the record ever stick its groove And the tankard drunk on the lawn for Robert Frost 29 October 1967 Review Didn't see the hate before Didn't know it was there It's a hell of a shock to see what's writ Was ever a soul so bare But what's down there is but half the truth The easier bit to rhyme The magic that dances from silver lips Is saved for a happier time That purity the saving grace Was smashed in the hammer blow God grant it was only squashed flat And the recovery's been slow You can't be bad without plenty of good Or else the mind is torn But you seem to have played for keeps And ripped the soul you adorn Can't believe it's really true That it's ugly and spiteful and trite I always believed that underneath The heart was warm still bright The horrors are weighted so high in the mind They can't be looked at straight Verses only chew at the edge The centre insane in state The neurosis is known The pattern well read But how to be surgeon Inside your own head To be told you were Pound When talking of Cecy Was a warning that sound Betrays fallacy The silver tongue was my sport in the past It took me through everything But when can I ever risk that dance And whisper words again Somewhere deep is a heart I know That promised in the sun But the hate was so deeply set at the start Nowhere left to run You carry the cancer for twenty years And try to be sweet and true But God knows the moment you turn from heights \nThe filth eats right through The only hope is to stick to the same We really should never been born We give you your moments of magic and mirth And love you in spite of the scorn Separate in ourselves We love all the world And hate it for what it has done But the art that is bad Is to break down and howl Revenging for what was torn The spirit of Shelley is there for us And the fun of sleek old Cat Thank God that Will he knew it all What Burns instincted at But the hate the hate Am I too late Do I start where others stop For I know that life is but ten years old Before the trees were cut 1967 Odyssey When I may write of her That made me that I am My rhymes need no more run Her self enough of flair I paint her picture not Scribbling another's face The reason for this waste Unknown lost but sought I knew her in a moment When our eyes met the first time A trance yet twenty yards away As met fate sprang my mind To read there's something there To sense that all's not words As the need for finding breaks The hunted with the hounds Is not the same as meeting one Was sprung by birth to stars Yet I may not write of her That taught me I was real Could the beauty be all mine A reflection of myself But that's not true 'twas there Your poetry in the night As you laughed and spoke till dawn And I worshipped at your sight I hear your voice no more Yet I seek it through my life 1967 Perennial The comfort of a well filled page With rhymes and rhythms perfected The exact word the clever phrase All earned the accolade 'Master' Another world of measured graces Where dictioned voices uttered Classic tones without complication Of thinking Freudian lovers A Great War fell down on sheltered styles And revealed much more in beauty That a gentle heart and a rustic sense Could not suffice as poetry For verse to be a preserver of language The receptacle of civilised dignity Is to ignore the blood and the fire of the times There's no purpose in obscurity Better to practice the monosyllabic Encourage the new propaganda Than measure the shock of the Peasant Revolt With words designed for Miranda 1968 Morning You in the dim morning light Laughing and staring Your hair fluffed and shoulders bare As you listened in the morning To a mind racing its patterns With no understanding Appeasing its gods Mouthing its prayers And you listened in the morning As the cool hard floor Touched at tense fingers Beckoning in the dawn And you spoke of a someone Who perhaps loved a someone But you were so young in the morning Who taught you this game?",0.7711284756660461],["X1011626461-00174-48155</DOCNO> First 1000 words of the General Service List a able about above accept accord account across act actual add

ELSIS For Future Generations Part 1 (this page) Part 2 LOVEARTH BE YOUR BEST RESONATE LOVE MARK ELSIS 1/8/58 RESONATE LOVE All Rights Reserved Copyright 1997 by Mark Elsis Saviour Of Humanity What a beautiful life given us A paradise for humans to run Live forever or turn to dust Whatever happens it's what we've done And now that we have reached The time to choose our destiny Global unity I do preach Love the saviour of humanity The Rivets Are Popping 500 plus species per day Are leaving the web of life Man's extinction is on the way Cutting our own throats with a knife Like Paul Ehrlich says The rivets are popping We're like a plane in the air And each time a species goes extinct Another rivet pops from the metal One by one they pop till The plane falls apart and crashes Beauty Beauty is vanishing At an alarming rate Man is in a hurry He just can't wait The Sea Empress Let go of her oil there mate In a marine sanctuary Now isn't that great Double hulled tankers Once more too late Now the coast of Wales Is in a slippery state What we want we get That is our fate Beauty is vanishing At an alarming rate It's Over It's over It's all over The camels back Has broke Reckless man Foolish man Irreversible damage I found all around On this day to me It finally spoke Please Please understand That we must stop Our destroying ways Or we will go extinct Please understand Let go of and drop These are our last days To transform too awareness Or we will go extinct Please understand Please The Last Song Singing and singing For a mate But there are no mates To be found The last of his kind But he keeps on singing I wonder if he knows How beautiful he sings The last song Trivial Matters Wasting our time with distracting Trivial matters While our Earth is being decimated In our lifetime In front of our eyes When there is nothing more important For humanity to do Then to face this atrocity And deal with it with all our energies But no not us We'd rather be Wasting our time with distracting Trivial matters Homo Sapiens The massive Slaughter Of all life On Earth The iceberg Is now ripping The unsinkable Titanic Homo Sapiens Pissing In The Wind Propaganda Goebbels Would have been astonished of So neat and packaged now It fits just like an old glove The disorganized majority Always pissing in the wind Fragmantated filled with hatred Only to themselves they've sinned For All Life Is Interdependent First the church Then the government Now the corporation Next the cooperation Of every human on Earth For all life is interdependent Unforeseen Consequences We are way out of control With the 70,000 plus chemicals in use Our children's future we stole The legacy we leave is nothing but abuse Of ourselves and our beautiful planet Earth We do not know the unforeseen consequences Of the interaction all these chemicals together We do not know how they will affect our senses But I can tell you now it won't be for the better Distractions Keep watching those screens Filling you up with useless information There are no need for your dreams We just want a homogenous civilization Distractions everywhere you turn So you're caught up in the game Distractions maybe someday you'll learn Are only here to keep us all the same Blinded Blinded by greed Blinded by ambition Too deaf to heed A slave to submission Materialism fills your days Return on investment rules Corporations have their ways Indoctrination of the fools Don't Worry Don't worry about overpopulation Don't worry about all the pollution Don't worry about deforestation Don't worry about a sustainable solution Don't worry about global warming Don't worry about the ozone hole Don't worry about new viruses forming Don't worry about the kids future we stole Don't worry about nuclear weapons or power Don't worry about pesticides in your food Don't worry about 4000 kids starving to death each hour Don't worry about the TV being stupid and crude Don't worry about all fish stocks declining Don't worry about corrosive life killing acid rain Don't worry about the massive strip mining Don't worry about billions of slaughtered animals pain Don't worry about the 266 billion for defense Don't worry about total corporate power Don't worry about the loss of common sense Don't worry about chlorine in your shower Don't worry about grain yields diminishing Don't worry about cancer rates rising Don't worry about another species finishing Don't \nworry about your company downsizing Don't worry about recycling your trash Don't worry about genetic engineering Don't worry about it ending in a flash Don't worry about anything you're fearing Because our complete devastation of all life Is now irreversible Once Filled With Hope I try to find hope But there is none to be found It is getting harder to cope With the devastation all around I try to find hope But I'm disappointed every time I'm at the end of my rope Waiting for humanity to pay for its crime I try to find hope But it is irreversibly too late I was once filled with hope But now I know that which is to be our fate The Weight Of The World I want to see the majesty I want to sense the wonder I want to advert the tragedy I want to stop the blunder The weight of the world The time running out The hate constantly unfurled The crime of silence all about The Pervasive Charade Keep it up Prop it up Never let it fall The pervasive charade Is now spoken By all A Dead Canary In A Coal Mine Like the lemmings Marching to the sea I see all of humanity Racing to the end A dead canary In a coal mine that's me Warning us now The Earth needs to mend To Bare Witness Take a stand Show your voice Together we band For we have no choice But to bare witness To our own desolation Hoodwinked Cheated deceived swindled We've all been hoodwinked A long long time ago The democrats and republicans Devilishly sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future generations Consume Less Running from here to there And then back again and again For this that and all the other Silly useless and wasteful things We no longer are looking to share Like we did way back when Almost everyone helped one another Lost is the happiness this brings Open yourself try voluntary simplicity Learning to consume less is so freeing Show the corporations no complicity Slow down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation A masterful job where PR firms strive And a dumbing down of education Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The place media conglomerates strive And all Hollywood produces obfuscation Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The part for politicians so desperately strive A government act of incautious deliberation Tinkering With Divine Creation Playing with deadly radiation Like a bunch of babbling babies Tinkering with divine creation Never caring about all the maybes Trying to genetically engineer life While your own species goes extinct Lying to hide all inequitable strife When to Earth you are forever linked The Oligarchy Desperate ubiquitous inequalities Executed by the privileged few Horrendous nightmarish actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we act in time Restore the earth or you'll be Taken away to make it fine Distorted Views Misinformation disinformation Cover ups and lies It doesn't matter which administration They're all cut from the same pies Distorted views Slanted news It'll make you numb What right to choose You'll only lose Are the thoughts of some One Every Second They're dying of starvation One every second They're praying for salvation From the misery there born in But we turn our backs Having our own problems getting by Avoiding the horrid facts While the 3rd world babies cry Till death The Beings From Afar The beings from afar Must look at us and laugh Just babies in evolution Crawling down extinction's path John Lennon You made me write the words I do I'll even admit I idolized you Your assassination ended an era so they say But your message still lives in me each day And I'll reach the masses because I feel That certain destruction is for real If our ways don't change from what is now And stop the killing weapons we let allow Oh the hypocrisy we let go on The human civilization ends with a con With shortsighted leaders sedating us all Technology betrays with apathy we fall As Confusion Creeps In Coming down on your self As confusion creeps in Forgetting pain ruining health What is moral what is sin Each day blurs by Does anything really matter Alone sometimes I cry Wondering will tomorrow be sadder The Atomic Hump Five evolution's to get it right And here we go again Constantly in conflict and fight I think it's time to say when Enough is enough I'm bored of the game Drop the act of being tough Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end I saw a shadow Lurked in the darkness I thought security Because the article How many times I've past before Those iron gates Can I cry once more Since I was five I've heard the words Now only vinyl Is left to hear The Tears Did Shed For You Billy Will it get better Will it get worse There's rainy weather With a black hearse The tears did shed While not believing A word you said So much grieving Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn away It starts in you It starts in me Help restore our earth So future generations can be We Make Each minute that passes 100 acres of tropical forest Goes never to come back Within just one hour 4000 \nchildren starve to death While surplus crops go bad Every day that goes by There are 27 oil spills In the United States alone In one orbit around the sun More than a trillion dollars Of killing weapons we make In Order To Exist Its come so quick Its hard to tell In just a flick We've emptied the well Foresight is cheap When it's too late We're sinking in deep Still wanting the bait Computer malfunction Warning overload Drastic measures needed In order to continue We must all realize this is it We must change In order to exist As If By Divine Plan Take some time And think about this Listen real careful Cause there's no time to miss It's getting beyond reach It's gotten out of hand The power hungry preach As if by divine plan And you don't know Or just let it go by And you're always on the go But always asking why They drain your life Squeeze every last drop Tell you of freedom When looking from the top Groomed Puppets That Deceive How clever the manipulation In this land of the free How money breeds dedication In the name of liberty With political promising lies You know better than believe They're all the same you realize Groomed puppets that deceive So you give up hope Believing it will never change Apathy is how you cope Something you always found strange Without Deception The ladder of success With cut out steps Leads you nowhere Without deception Too Much Too Soon And Then Well here we are again Apathetic up till the end Too much too soon and then No recourse Take Take Take It's total chaos It's complete madness It can't go on It'll never last Take take take Until no more Is left to give Test Subjects We are the test subjects We are the dying breed We are the last checks Here to balance the greed An awaken you all So we can plant a new seed Knock down the wall That strangles you like a weed We are here to change Extinction to perpetuation Get rid of the strange Leading us to devastation It's all up to us To want a new day With us you can trust We won't lead you astray What's best for all Is the way it will be Knock down the wall For unity is the key And it won't be easy Cause they're set in their way Molded in the cast Until their dying day Which won't be long So we have no time to waste We've already been led along So now we have to haste And think for tomorrow Forget about yesterday It will only bring you sorrow And happiness is the only way Evolution's Choice Is Now Sand slipping through The hour glass Evolution's choice is now Humanity's last pass Won't wait Tomorrow's awareness In vain too late Today's judgment Decides earth's fate You've Given Up Hope You've given up hope You can't change the system Mellowing out with age You no longer try to resist them You've lost your morals They've changed your ways But deep down it eats at you They've trapped you in the maze Torn between the dream you had And the life you live Still knowing your being had But not wanting to give Inhospitable In every way possible We're destroying ourselves Making tomorrow inhospitable As long as today it sells Extinct Is Forever Man's the enemy Technology the tool Extinct is forever Don't be a fool And say it's all right Or laugh it away Stand up and fight Our numbers will say Something positive That will catch like fire An expose all the greedy Cold hearted liars To Shed Some Light I try to write About what I feel is wrong To shed some light About how we're led along In this land of the free We must be brave For our future you see A new road we must pave Playing Fate With Dice We are our own god For good or bad Our earth paradise So don't be mad In the years to come We pay the price Following blinded leaders Playing fate with dice A Merry Go Round It's just the same old game With the played out scenes A merry go round with inbetweens Lost in a fog in a sea of confusion Looking for help through realities illusion Got to break out and get away Or the conditioning ties will stay Trapping you till tomorrow's today Becomes a bitter memory of yesterday Government Sponsored There's no way out Unless you care I can scream and shout About what ain't fair But you've got to change From deep inside Brought up fast and strange Don't run and hide From the troubled day By taking drugs To escape the pain It's a cover up To keep us down Government sponsored Every pound Throw In The Towel Toxic dumps Radiation leaks Cancer lumps Mutated freaks Toxic shock Agent orange Government mock

Pollution pace Elegant dining Atomic tests Silkwood dead Militarily best To beat the red Drug sedaters Alcohol waiters Shut you up Make you give up Take Responsibility Turn away And it only gets worse Stay in the gray Until your in the hearse \nTake responsibility And it can only get better We have the ability It's just the choice of whether We take responsibility Or turn away When Humanity Wept How do you cope With global suicide How do you hope When you turn and hide What is there left For you to believe in When humanity wept Drowned in their grieving I Still Imagine In first grade My President was blown away I wondered why In fifth grade Martin and Robert were filled with lead I began to understand In the summer before high school Morrison was in French soil But no one was there I became scared For John The warmest 8th of December In New York City history I was driving my cab When Vinny broke the news From that day till now At 29 Every time I pass 1 West 72nd street I feel humanity Has no hope But I still imagine A Paradise Yours Pure There's always been war You don't learn by mistakes A paradise yours pure And only one for the takes For Tomorrow Today We're at the time When we can't look away We need a solution For tomorrow today A Handful Of Companies A handful of companies Make the decisions They bought the country Electing their politicians An army full of men To protect and kill The number one game Leader of the hill Not Knowing It's the thought of not knowing If we'll be here tomorrow The constant peril always growing As if each day we must borrow This

Stage 1: Cleavage Via restriction endonucleases Large number of specific fragments called library Different library for each specific sequence Fragments compared by electrophoresis fig 19.6 Stage 2: Producing recombinant DNA Fragments put into plasmids or virus vehicles Fragment replicated with vehicle genome Stage 3: Cloning Fragment-containing vehicles introduced into bacteria Bacteria reproduce making identical replicas Each cell line maintained separately Whole set constitutes clone library of original DNA Stage 4: Screening Identify clone line containing fragment of interest Among most difficult and critical steps Preliminary Screening of Clones Eliminate bacteria not containing proper DNA fragment Use genes conferring antibiotic resistance fig 19.7a Eliminate bacteria without vehicle Culture clones on medium containing antibiotic Only bacteria resistant to antibiotic will grow on it Eliminate bacteria with vehicle, but lacking fragment Use vector with gene that enables cell to metabolize X-gal sugar Metabolism of X-gal produces blue product Cells with vector and functional gene will turn blue fig 19.7b Test clones for presence of X-gal metabolism Clones with fragment lose ability to metabolize sugar DNA fragment within gene makes it inoperative Cells remain colorless in presence of X-gal Finding the Gene of Interest fig 19.8 Clone library may contain thousands of DNA fragments Southern blot technique Fragments spread apart by electrophoresis Gel blotted with nitrocellulose, DNA transfers to sheet Probe poured onto nitrocellulose sheet Only fragments with proper gene hybridize with probe Probe may be radioactive chemical Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) fig 19.9 Cut DNA samples with particular restriction Separate fragments according to length with electrophoresis Use radioactive probe to identify fragments Obtain unique pattern of bands in gel Called \"DNA fingerprinting\" Used in criminal forensic investigations Used as markers to identify carriers of certain genetic disorders Getting Enough DNA to Work With: The Polymerase Chain Reaction Produce multiple identical copies of DNA fig 19.10 PCR used to amplify sequences or add sequences as primers to cleaved DNA Five steps in PCR process Tagging Primer of synthetic nucleotides mixed with DNA fragment template Increase size of fragment and give it a unique tag Heating Temperature of mixture increased to 98% C Both primed fragment and oligonucleotide dissociate into single strands Priming Solution cooled to 60% C Single strands of DNA reassociate into double strands Fragment base-pairs with complementary primer nucleotide Part of fragment still single stranded Copying Heat stable DNA polymerase added along with supply of all four nucleotides Polymerase copies rest of fragment as in DNA replication Oligonucleotide primer lengthened into complementary copy of single-stranded fragment Two copies of original now exist Repeating the cycle Repeat heating and cooling in short cycles Each cycle doubles amount of DNA After twenty cycles one fragment can become more than one million PCR allows investigation of minute samples of DNA Has had enormous impact on all aspects of biology fig 19.11 BIO TECHNOLOGY: A SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION Pharmaceuticals Most obvious commercial application of gene technology Bacteria can produce gene products in bulk Several forms of interferon, human insulin Manufacture valuable nonhuman enzymes Produce medically important proteins Atrial peptides: regulate blood pressure, kidney function Tissue plasminogen activator: dissolves blood clots Must separate desired protein from bacterial proteins Time-consuming and expensive Produce RNA transcripts of genes Make proteins directly in cell-free culture Probing the Human Genome Localize cloned gene location via radioactive probe Construction of clonal libraries Use large-size restriction fragments Associate disease genes with restriction fragments Identify presence of fragments with electrophoresis Do genetic screening for potential birth defects Attempt treatment or cure with gene therapy Example: cystic fibrosis Propose sequencing of entire human genome fig 19.12 Construct detailed map of human genome Controversial as it requires significant resources Piggyback Vaccines Subunit vaccines for herpes virus and hepatitis viruses fig 19.13 Protein-polysaccharide coat genes isolated Spliced to vaccinia virus DNA Live vaccinia added to cell culture with fragments Recombinant virus carries coat genes of other virus Infected animal produces antibodies to outer surface of virus Make antibodies against virus without exposure to it Agriculture Initial difficulty in identifying suitable plant vector Currently use Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium Infects broad leaf plants but not cereal plants Attach other genes to this plasmid fig 19.14 Development of Flavr Savr tomatoes Contain fish antifreeze gene Produce ethylene glycol from ethylene Lack of ethylene delays ripening of fruit \nHerbicide Resistance Broadleaf plants engineered to be resistant to glyphosate Glyophosate is the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide fig 19.15 Extra copies of EPSP synthetase gene via Ti plasmid Plants overproduce enzyme Overcome glyphosate suppression Advantages Crops would not need to be weeded Wide variety of weeds killed and desired crop spared Glyphosate readily degradable Virus Resistance Ti plasmids introduce genes into broadleaf plants TMV protein coat genes placed into tobacco chromosomes fig 19.16 Grow plant via tissue culture All progeny cells contain TMV coat genes Transgenic plants do not develop disease as if infected with whole TMV Insect Resistance Insects presently controlled via chemical insecticides Engineer plants for resistance to insects Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein genes fig 19.17 Ingested by tomato hornworm, converted to poison Harmless to animals with different stomach enzymes Genes introduced into plants via Ti plasmid Plants safe from attack by insects that eat them fig 19.18 Examples: Genetically altered potato kills Colorado potato beetle Cotton resistant to bollworms Corn resists European corn borer Isolation insect-killing enzyme from a fungus Cholesterol oxidase disrupts insect gut membranes Fungal gene inserted into a variety of crops Kills variety of insects including cotton boll weevil and Colorado potato beetle Introduce insecticidal protein into root bacteria B. thuringiensis does not normally inhabit roots Protect roots from various pests, including Pseudomonas Nitrogen Fixation Insert proper genes into non-leguminous plants Provide plants with own fertilizer Farm Animals Somatotropin growth hormone (BST) synthetically produced Added to diary cow`s diet to increase milk yield fig 19.19 Potential to increase weight of cattle and pigs fig 19.20 Human tests to increase size of hormonal dwarfs Public resistance to BST in milk Generalized fears of gene technology BST is a proteins, digested in stomach Development of transgenic animals Other Applications Create strains of bacteria to eat oil spills Grow \"synthetic cotton\" Forensic use Identification of individuals Ethics and Regulation Concerns regarding tampering with genetic material Accidental production of a cancer-transmitting bacterium Intentional development of a killer virus Dangerous complications of genetically engineered products administered to plants or animals in future generations Ecological impact of \"improved\" crops Potential of creating \"genetically superior\" organisms, including humans Most of public's concerns not well-founded Most organisms used in genetic engineering incompatible with human hosts Recombinant technology like natural crossing, only faster Genetic \"dabbling\" by humans minuscule compared to natural mutations Genetic engineering research under close scrutiny Appropriate experimental safeguards established Scientists

www.cowboypoetry.com JAY SNIDER Cyril, Oklahoma About Jay Snider My Old Amigo Lum He ain&#146;t much on conversation His old mind, it wanders some But a better compadre ain&#146;t lived or breathed Than my ole&#146; amigo Lum Now Lum, he&#146;s plenty punchy Ya won&#146;t find a tougher old coot But down right, plain old common sense Ain&#146;t one of his stronger suits You won&#146;t find a better feller To have round ya in a pinch His head&#146;s as hard as granite rock And he won&#146;t give an inch We were cowboyin&#146; up in the Keechi hills It was one of our lighter days But we&#146;d &#145;bout had our bellies full Of cuttin&#146; those cedar stays The weekend, now was comin&#146; up Time for the big rodeo in town Been quite a spell since we&#146;d been in Lum and me would ride on down Now Lum ain&#146;t no spring chicken But he acts just like a kid When the bullriders finally mount the beasts Used to twist &#145;em himself, he did The crowd gathered &#145;round the buckin&#146; chutes They were thick as bitin&#146; fleas And Lum, his stature&#146;s lackin&#146; some Makin&#146; it tough for him to see Ole&#146; Lum sure ain&#146;t no genius But what next he did made sense He climbed up near the buckin&#146; chutes And sat upon the fence The fence sure ain&#146;t as comfy As his recliner back at the shack And the cable through the cross-tie posts Seemed to be a little slack Now ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s kinda portly Of a diet he ain&#146;t thought So the cable strand he sat upon Down the line had been drawn taught The announcer&#146;s voice boomed loudly Of the high horned brindle beast Two thousand pounds of ragin&#146; hell Was soon to be released On Widowmaker, they kicked the latch He followed the gate around Then planted his feet and sucked back left And slammed that cowboy down He gave the clown a hookin&#146; Made a lap around the pen But there ain&#146;t a fence for a hundred miles That could hold this brinlde in The Widowmaker, he sized it up Then made a fitful run He was intent on clearin&#146; that fence Just four posts down from Lum He quit the earth in one great leap Now comes the change of events A solid ton of snortin&#146; beef Hit smack on top of that \nfence Ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s cool, just sat there calm With both hands in his pockets But a ton of bull on that cable strand Shot Lum off like a rocket Now Lum survived the launchin&#146; And annihilation merely by chance But he didn&#146;t make re-entry &#145;Till halfway through the dance Lum told me it wasn&#146;t the launch Nor the

what he would say When he talked of the men he admired I remember those men he talked about Sure &#145;nuff cowboys, tough, but kind They said what they meant and meant what they said These men are getting&#146; harder to find &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he was true to his word That&#146;s all you expect of a man You knew for sure he was proud to meet you By the genuine shake of his hand &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant you could depend On this man no matter the task Never got too tough, too cold, or too late For his help, all you need do is ask &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he had a light hand Be it with horses or cattle or crew He spent most of his life learning this cowboy trade And he&#146;d be honored to teach it to you &#147;There&#146; a good feller&#148; meant don&#146;t ask him to do What ain&#146;t on a true and honest track He knows it&#146;s easier to keep a good reputation Than it is to try to build one back &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he&#146;s a fair minded man He helped write cowboyin&#146;s unwritten laws He won&#146;t ask you to do what he wouldn&#146;t do Yet knows, at times, the short end you&#146;ll draw &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant, when he&#146;s down on his luck He can still hold his head way up high &#145;Cause he did his best and gave it his all He knows with faith and God&#146;s help he&#146;ll get by &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words And their meaning won&#146;t run all that deep But when Dad would use &#145;em to describe certain men You knew they were at the top of the heap &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words But they&#146;ve always been favorites of mine If after my trails end, my name&#146;s brought up &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148; would suit me just fine Jay Snider, All rights reserved The Cattle Market Me and the cattle market need to get in synch This terminal poverty is a bunch of bull When the market goes up, I won&#146;t own but three When it&#146;s down, my pastures are full Now I&#146;m not one for gripin&#146; And I dearly love this life But fifty- cent calves and ten dollar feed Is hard to explain to my wife But she wouldn&#146;t trade it for a job in town The new babies, she names &#145;em all And she&#146;ll be mad for two months runnin&#146; When I sell &#145;em off in the fall I&#146;ve read and studied genetics I think my breeding program is keen But I have an idea I&#146;m missin&#146; something Cause my calves all looks Holstein Blacks and baldies are the packer&#146;s choice I thought I&#146;d have &#145;er made last fall But calving time proved disappointing The neighbor&#146;s longhorn had sired &#145;em all This year&#146;s crop is a sight to behold I&#146;ve been assured they&#146;re some of the best But my banker will get almost all they bring And Ivomec will get the rest My fences are in need of major repairs And I&#146;m just nearly out of hay But if the market stays up, I won&#146;t own but three cows And I won&#146;t need fences anyway Forty- percent cubes are the best you can buy To hear the man at the Co-op tell it But I buy the cheap twenty- percent kind So my cows can have more than one pellet My banker agrees that I need some help But that ranchin&#146;sure ain&#146;t my callin&#146; He allows I ought to sell off my cows Cause the darned market&#146;s started fallin&#146; If the bottom falls out of the market now I&#146;ll have way too many again So I&#146;ll sell &#145;em off and cut my loss But now I&#146;m right back where I&#146;ve been When spring grass comes, I&#146;ll buy some back Cause without &#145;em I&#146;d sooner die I&#146;ll bet a hundred the market will be up And they&#146;ll be too darned high to buy So I&#146;ll patiently wait till the market goes down And I can buy &#145;em real cheap you see Then I&#146;ll keep &#145;em and feed &#145;em till the market goes up Or till my \nbanker takes all but &#145;bout three 2000, Jay Snider, All rights reserved Two of a Kind I thought he&#146;d lost his mind That cold December day When he came draggin&#146; in That little snake poor bay, Lord, what a sight He looked near dead And there ain&#146;t no way That neck will hold up that head, For a two year old past He wasn&#146;t very big And

Merwin CHAPTER ONE CEREMONY AFTER AN AMPUTATION Spirits of the place who were here before I saw it to whom I have made such offerings as I have known how to make wanting from the first to approach you with recognition bringing for your swept ridge trees lining the wind with seedlings that have grown now to become these long wings in chorus where the birds assemble and settle their flying lives you have taught me without meaning and have lifted me up without talk or promise and again and again reappeared to me unmistakable and changing and unpronounceable as a face dust of the time a day in late spring after the silk of rain had fallen softly through the night and after the green morning the afternoon floating brushed with gold and then the sounds of machines erupting across the valley and elbowing up the slopes pushing themselves forward to occupy you to be more of you who remain the untouched silence through which they are passing I try to hear you remembering that we are not separate to find you who cannot be lost or elsewhere or incomplete nature of the solitary machine coming into the story from the minds that conceived you and the hands that first conjured up the phantom of you in fine lines on the drawing board you for whom function is all the good that exists you to whom I have come with nothing but purpose a purpose of my own as though it was something we shared you that were pried from the earth without anyone consulting you and were carried off burned beaten metamorphosed according to plans and lives to which you owed nothing let us be at peace with each other let peace be what is between us and you now single vanished part of my left hand bit of bone finger- end index who began with me in the dark that was already my mother you who touched whatever I could touch of the beginning and were how I touched and who remembered the sense of it when I thought I had forgotten it you in whom it waited under your only map of one untrodden mountain you who did as well as we could through all the hours at the piano and who helped undo the bras and found our way to the treasure and who held the fruit and the pages and knew how to button my right cuff and to wash my left ear and had taken in heart beats of birds and beloved faces and hair by day and by night fur of dogs ears of horses tongues and the latches of doors so that I still feel them clearly long after they are gone and lake water beside the boat one evening of an ancient summer and the vibration of a string over which a bow was moving as though the sound of the note were still playing and the hand of my wife found in the shallows of waking you who in a flicker of my inattention signalled to me once only my error telling me of the sudden blow from the side so that I looked down to see not you any longer but instead a mouth full of blood calling after you who had already gone gone gone ahead into what I cannot know or reach or touch leaving in your place only the cloud of pain rising into the day filling the light possessing every sound becoming the single color and taste and direction yet as the pain recedes and the moment of it you remain with me even in the missing of you small boat moving before me on the current under the daylight whatever you had touched and had known and took with you is with me now as you are when you are already there unseen part of me reminding me warning me pointing to what I cannot see never letting me forget you are my own speaking only to me going with me all \nthe rest of the way telling me what is still here THE STRANGER (After a Guarani legend recorded by Ernesto Morales) One day in the forest there was somebody who had never been there before it was somebody like the monkeys but taller and without a tail and without so much hair standing up and walking on only two feet and as he went he heard a voice calling Save me as the stranger looked he could see a snake a very big snake with a circle of fire that was dancing all around it and the snake was trying to get out but every way it turned the fire was there so the stranger bent the mink of a young tree and climbed out over the fire until he could hold a branch down to the snake and the snake wrapped himself around the branch and the stranger pulled the snake up out of the fire and as soon as the snake saw that he was free he twined himself around the stranger and started to crush the life out of him but the stranger shouted No No I am the one who has just saved your life and you pay me back by trying to kill me but the snake said I am keeping the law it is the law that whoever does good receives evil in return and he drew his coils tight around the stranger but the stranger kept on saying No No I do not believe that is the law so the snake said I will show you I will show you three times and you will see and he kept his coils tight around the stranger's neck and all around his arms and body but he let go of the stranger's legs Now walk he said to the stranger Keep going so they started out that way and they came to a river and the river said to them I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I save them from dying of thirst and all they do is stir up the mud and fill my water with dead things the snake said One the stranger said Let us go on and they did and they came to a carand&#225;-i palm there were wounds running with sap on its trunk and the palm tree was moaning I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I give them my fruit and my shade and they cut me and drink from my body until I die the snake said Two the stranger said Let us go on and they did and came to a place where they heard whimpering and saw a dog with his paw in a basket and the dog said I did a good thing and this is what came of it I found a jaguar who had been hurt and I took care of him and he got better and as soon as he had his strength again he sprang at me wanting to eat me up I managed to get away but he tore my paw I hid in a cave until he was gone and here in this basket I have a calabash full of milk for my wound but now I have pushed it too far down to reach will you help me he said to the snake and the snake liked milk better than anything so he slid off the stranger and into the basket and when he was inside the dog snapped it shut and swung it against a tree with all his might again and again until the snake was dead and after the snake was dead in there the dog said to the stranger Friend I have saved your life and the stranger took the dog home with him and treated him the way the stranger would treat a dog THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES At what moment can it be said to occur the grand stillness of this symmetry whose horizons become the horizon and whose designer's name seems to be Ours even when the designer has long since vanished and the king his master whom they called The Sun in his day is nobody again here are the avenues of light reflected and magnified and here the form's vast claim to have been true forever as the law of a universe in which nothing appears to change and there was nothing before this except defects of Nature and a waste of marshes a lake a chaos of birds and wild things a river making its undirected way it was always the water that was motion even while thirty six thousand men and six thousand horses for more than three decades diverted it into a thousand fountains and when all those men and horses had gone the water flowed on and the sound of water falling echoes in the dream the dream of water in which the avenues all of them are the river on its own way CHORUS The wet bamboo clacking in the night rain crying in the darkness whimpering softly as the hollow columns touch and slide along each other swaying with the empty air these are sounds from before there were voices gestures older than grief from before there was pain as we know it the impossibly tall stems are reaching out groping and waving before longing as we think of it or loss as we are acquainted with it or feelings able to recognize the syllables that might be their own calling out to them like names in the dark telling them nothing about loss or about longing nothing ever about all that has yet to answer WHAT IS A GARDEN All day working happily down near the stream bed the light passing into the remote opalescence it \nreturns to as the year wakes toward winter a season of rain in a year already rich in rain with masked light emerging on all sides in the new leaves of the palms quietly waving time of mud and slipping and of overhearing the water under the sloped ground going on whispering as it travels time of rain thundering at night and of rocks rolling and echoing in the torrent and of looking up after noon through the high branches to see fine rain drifting across the sunlight over the valley that was abused and at last left to fill with thickets of rampant aliens bringing habits but no stories under the mango trees already vast as clouds there I keep discovering beneath the tangle the ancient shaping of water to which the light of an hour comes back as to a secret and there I planted young palms in places I had not pondered until then I imagined their roots setting out in the dark knowing without knowledge I kept trying to see them standing in that bend of the valley in the light that would come A NIGHT FRAGRANCE Now I am old enough to remember people speaking of immortality as though it were something known to exist a tangible substance that might be acquired to be used perhaps in the kitchen every day in whatever was made there forever after and they applied the word to literature and the names of things names of persons and the naming of other things for them and no doubt they repeated that word with some element of belief when they named a genus of somewhat more than a hundred species of tropical trees and shrubs some with flowers most fragrant at night for James Theodore Tabernaemontanus of Heidelberg physician and botanist highly regarded in his day over four centuries ago immortality might be like that with the scattered species continuing their various evolutions the flowers opening by day or night with no knowledge of bearing a name of anyone and their fragrance if it reminds at all not reminding of him By W.S.

C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~14~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My World Did Grow As I grew up and learned the way two blocks from home I could play if I checked in several times to say \"I'm playing over there, over that way\" The world where I lived and played now grew to reveal many things, some strange, all new this world even had a wonderful stream where I could wade, splash and dream it held many crabs and pollywogs lots of skippers and many frogs I'd build a dam to make a pool to wade and splash in, it kept me cool of the creatures that lived in this waterway some were funny, others strange, I'd say pollywogs grow to be frogs you know but be careful of crabs, they can pinch your toe they have claws instead of front feet they use them like hands, to hold what they eat be careful of them as you do play if they pinch you it will hurt, I must say A skipper is a funny sight he swims on the water both day and night he has eight legs with which to swim you will have to be quick if you want to catch him he will not hurt you, he will not bite he is really strange, an amusing sight if you are patient and quietly stand you might catch one with your bare hand I'd make a boat out of some piece of wood it would float so smooth, so good I'd make a mast and large sail too all of this took some time to do I'd set it afloat in that small creek I'd guide it along with a pole or stick until the sail would fill with the summer breeze if you are patient, you can make one of these Now in the winter when it is cold don't be too brave, don't be too bold for if the creek is covered with ice falling through it is not very nice the water beneath will numb you feet then you'll run home to find some heat to warm your hands, your feet, your toes this isn't much fun, as I well know &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B.

curse the strings You forget music for now It hurts you too much You call to your ladies place No answer, never a right answer Throw the phone like the guitar Your parents call to out to you Worried about all the noise You tell them to shut up And go to your room To wallow in self pity The beauty of self pity Solitude your only friend left She'll never desert you Never leave you alone Sad, but so true No words can leave your mouth Without amazing disgust Infiltrating them deeply All that once you held close Once was who you are Now you loath Solitude always will be your best friend Stains Of Love Lost Tears cover the paper The hand of the heart No longer can move For your mouth is shut So much left unsaid Way too much heard Meanings misconstrued Hearts torn apart Like they're paper dolls No pain expected Less felt The feeling of the soul Pour out in tears The tears burn like acid Streaks cover your face The stains of love lost The scars of friendship lost Throbbing takes over the mind God's not forgotten But devils almost worshiped For the devils remove the pain The pain in your heart The pain your soul has From the ten or twenty words That were as excruciating As paper cuts A millimeter deep Yet more painful Then a thousand spears Bullets maces or swords That penetrate your body As much as these few words Penetrated your soul For though the cause is gone Your heart is still in your body And you'll never remove it What a pity Unjustly convicted Loves once found now are lost Where once you held tight You have no grip at all The meandering days pass by One to the next no different People change, faces change But hearts nor thoughts have faded Faded away at all Promiscuity made to failure And promises now broken Loves vowed are the ones lost The fates tamper with your mind With your heart, even your soul Just because they can Unjustly convicted Sentenced to a horrific death Christ your savior nowhere to be seen If only your tears were as such Instead they pour from your eyes Like the drop of rain From a torrential hurricane And you are left wondering Why, why if love is pure Love cannot bear imperfections If love truly is love Then why does it hurt so much And as you lay in \nbed Contemplating your death Your lover comes to the door Only to reveal their true love And confine you in misery Your whole, entire life Juliet Juliet lies down to sleep Gives the knife her soul to keep Romeo sees her from afar And in the ground he does carve I love you know, loved you then Never shall these feelings ever bend Like the lightning crashing from above To your memory I'll hold tough The days how long, nights so deep Never shall my heart ever sleep The long blonde hair bright as gold Many a man his bliss hath sold And nothing short of a shadow's kiss Has ever made on more remiss Made on feel he himself hath died Solely because of those who lied About content, happiness, joy Those who played us like a toy Once that's carved he walks to the grave Cursing now all loves slaves Juliet's eyes now are closed Drops of blood still on her nose The knife still stuck in her bosom He now thinks how he'll be so lonesome The countless days with love amiss The numerous nights with out that kiss And before he knows what takes his mind The knife from her chest in his hands he finds And plunges it deep into his skull To shrew the pain, make it annul With his last words he cries for Juliet His words were lost like the name he forgets For 'tis not Juliet there in the grave 'Tis his Julia, for whom he himself hath slain And as the two caskets down the street are marched Though the fountains under the arch Tears are shed for the senseless crime But this crime is the crime of the time Scent Of the Flame You wake up from your sleep And feel an odd heat on you You see the forest around you afire Smoke gushes from the dry trees Trees fall and block all your paths All on fire, all impossible to avoid You are left alone in your campground With just your tent, and your clothes You panic but think quickly and pack your clothes And pack up your tent You have very little to your name But you are determined to keep it all You look around for a creek you bathed in But you see trees afire block that means of escape You look for the first path you cleared But even though the trees are all gone The bushes off to the sides of it have caught And they are an impenetrable wall of flames Hundred year oak trees fall like maples The pines, the pines where the sun doesn't ever shine Fall like they're just toothpicks for God You have no way to escape unharmed And though you don't accept it That harsh reality is forced upon you So you close your eyes and run headlong Into the fiery, flaming torch of Hell on Earth And eventually you emerge from the fire Hair singed, skin scorched, but tent and clothes in tack They reek of the fire, but are still yours The few things you had are still yours Even though they now have the scent of the flame Dale Lovers ripped and torn away Tears come forth every day The road was the last one to hold The one in the coffin all cold Cold in body, but warm in heart For his love of you shall never part Though stick and stone and gravel kill He has left his spirit all for good will All the pain and anguish he felt then Is not felt now as he is in Zen Or Heaven, or whatever the afterlife has Where we all will someday pass But here you remain, a crying wreck As a grieving widow this life you shall trek Though the pain will some day pass Your love stop to last For he was your life, passion, muse Your alpha and omega, heart's woo He was your all in all Not a once short did he fall But the Lord's taken him away from us Not our choice, but his plans are a must As much as to our disliking it is All the better are his sights and promises For one day not too many years from today We'll look back on this moment and say It was all for the best, as His plans always are And we'll look up to Heaven so afar And say \"Soon I'll be with you once again\" \"Soon I'll be with you my best of friends\" Sinners Frustrations set in Words confused Meanings missed Love her still you do But others come to view They all fail in compairison Through no fault of their own Her light still shines bright Brighter then any other you've seen Or are your eyes not seeing right For all have sinned And fallen short of her glory But you fail to see her sins it seems For many they have been Not as many as your own however You play God and judge her and others But you have not proper insight So you judgements aren't all accurate You condemn the righteous Uplift the followers of Satan Contradict yourself every statement Make liars seem like truth tellers The honest men hypocrits All because you love and unlovable Actually, she is lovable Just unobtainable Short sights and materialistic problems Are all holding you apart But it's those things which will never fade So you must stop judging others Start judging yourself And find happiness Where no one else has Blankets The magnificent blanket of security you once had Has been stolen from you while you were sleeping No longer does it keep you warm Or protect you from the cold breezes Or keep the penetrating rains away Instead now you are left at nature's mercy You see ominous clouds far \nover head Rains, sleets and hails may not be far away And that concerns you, scares you a lot You know the cold isolation is brutal You've had it before and hated every second of it But now it looks like it is back for a while You see others all around you with their blankets And you just envy them so much You think of yourself as being better than them You think that you alone deserve to be happy To be protected, kept warm, comforted Even despite the fact so many of the blankets Are covered with holes, and many stains But you had to find you own self pity and misery Keeps you blind to things like the others problems But just as you curse that which stole your blanket You see close friends without one as well Many in much poorer condition then you could fathom Some never having blankets in their life times Some having their blankets nearly suffocate them And you look at yourself on the water of the lake And you vow never to be without a blanket Anywhere close to as long as the others For though a blanket isn't a need to survive It's the most important thing to happiness And you will never be this sad again Julia's Heart You say you love me Yet a dollar takes presidence Even though the dollar should It still seems cruel You say you tell no lies Yet how do I know the truth Because you never show me What you really feel Sayings are said a million times Kisses exchanged like looks of the eyes More intimates things cherished Yet lost in the sparkle and fade Loves and lusts confused Materialism seems attractive Because materialism is something seen Where as my heart never is For all I say all I do Is forgotten by you today But remembered tomorrow But too often tomorrow is too late For other things come into our lives And though memories never change The values of them do For times makes silver tarnish And some thoughts fade away But the dream of happiness together doesn't It remains vivid through time Just like the scars in the heart The many, many scars in your heart Innumerable, and unmistakable Unhidable, unforeseeable, and undeniable And now you must go on Finding other lovers Finding ways to carry on But you can't and won't forget her The ways she made you feel so great And the ways she crashed your world Let's just hope someone can repair it The ravages of Julia's heart Public Display The slow pulses of your heart slowly disappear Charities assumed where only desperation exists Desperation for the joys of the heart Desperation for all that is right in the world Desperation for all that is held sacred in the heart Desperation to know the love isn't in vain Each ever slowing pulse emitts a small cry As it passes by the ventricles for the last time Because it knows it'll never see them again Before the cold hand of death takes hold All those once warm arteries and capilaries That flowed with an amazing love Collapse as that love has been stolen from them And your limbs slowly turn blue Your mind is a wreck in every way imaginable Your most amazing memories of passionate love Appearing to have meant nothing more Then the most insecently momentuous flings You have lost all sense and sensablility You cherish none of which you did years before All that once was intimate and secure to yourself Now is on public display for approval Approval by those of Satan, of those of God And most importantly, approval of yourself Ah the beauties of the need of self approval Never perfect, never horrid Always a malcontent existance with uncertain purpose No Other Man's You see them all there Holding hand, kissing lips And you think to yourself \"I've been there\" God you've been there But that was then And this is now Now is the time you live Your regrets for mistakes You promises left unfulfilled And your heart Your ever so empty heart Do not matter now Because they belong to her And she is no longer yours No other man's Nor woman's thank God But just not yours any longer But still you see the others Together for years Or just months or weeks Yet you envy their bodies For they have What you only can dream of Someone to kiss them good night Someone to hold them close When the troubles of life are too much When all that's good has gone bad And when they dreams are crushed And their hearts shattered Yet here you stand Alone, deeply in solitude For though all say You are a one in a million catch Only three have caste out for you And though all threw you back You still hold the dreams The ideas and images of the one The one who's heart had to listen Not to itself, but to its future White Smoke Weeks go by with out a word But fear has no grip on you For even though you haven't forgotten You've been too distracted Your friends keep you focused On your life, on your muses You find intimate contact with others Forgetting what real contact is When it's with the one you love When it's to show your love Not just to hide yourself Not just to help heal your heart Not to just help you forget All the pain that's in your heart From the lack of true love And contact, and knowledge For all that was know as gospel Now has clouds of white smoke Keeping you guessing as to what Is and was really there For no word is sometimes better Than a word that reminds you Of \nhow much you did love Of how much you did really care And how much you really still miss her For she made you strong when weak She alone could heal your mortal wounds She was God's gift to you Or so it seemed before the smoke came And now you're left wondering Just how God really does Heal the broken hearted And console the contrite spirit First Blow Days slip by like the tears from your cheeks The pains still as violent as the first blow But is now looked down on by many As a sign of weakness and patheticness For time has pass, time heals all wounds They say she's forgotten They say you should forget her as well But you can't forget all of what Once was your every breath You're hers and only hers Yet not hers at all And she's yours and only yours And at the same time has been ripped from you By senseless materialistic uncertain idiocy All for the sake of thinking better So you stand at the dawn of another new day That fateful restless night ages ago And you look at yourself, who you are You see the same face, same hand, same tongue And you think to yourself It's been too many nights with Too so suddenly be without And despite your hands face and tongue are the same Your heart isn't and never will be For she is yours in heart but someone else's in hand And it's her face that's against another's And it's now her heart, that has two men's affection Innocent Ignorance Where once warm hands held tight Now cooler hearts stand alone Time has passed like sands through the hourglass But the feelings of the heart hold fast Trials and tribulatiosn for us both Some of the most challenging times of our lives But we'd always be ok at night When we'd return home to each other Hold hands, and ever so softly kiss Softly, yet deeply, and passionately All our cares and worries would vanish As if they never existed to begin with We had a special, innocent pure love Despite the fact we knew we didn't have long Our future's destined to be different Our ambitions always the same Quantity was never a matter to us For the quality was always more then amazing And when the time to realize this happened Amazingly deep and seemingly never ending pain came Our worlds were flipped and we were tossed with chaos But despite all the pain, there was no anger As time passed the pain slowed Duller and duller it was with each passing month But it was still there like a constant headache But now a year approaches and we face a challenge Whether to celebrate our times together Or whether to mourn the losses we assumed Or whether we should just pretend like nothing happened Our loves nor lives the same as before So the fish is left to wander the stream in his westward direction Only to hope to not be pulled down by the easterner Thanksgiving The day to give thanks comes and goes You give thanks for your heart You give thanks for your life And you give thanks for the love of your heart Despite no longer do you hold it You remember how she made you feel How complete and bright she made your life And how she made you feel invincible The day has passed without many adieus The days to commemorate a love of life The days to commemorate a life of love And the days to remember all of our blessings A year has passed since these last occurrences Some you beg God never to remind you of Others you pray for every day to be repeated Like the day when you fell in love for the first time That day when the world you live in No longer remained in black, whites and grays But became filled with the colors of the rainbow The colors of love, the colors of life And your contrite spirit once again had breath For God did hear you and consoled the broken heart But it was only to let Satan break your brain Spill blood and muscles and heart and lungs all over Cover the pavement with all your good sense Rape the innocence of your mind Fragmentize all your memories and make you doubt All that you once held sacred, holy and just So this thanksgiving you're left here now With a healed body and a healed mind But a broken heart, which may never mend Iris Music swirls in your head and makes you shiver Sheer ecstacy fills your ears and hands But as the piece comes to an end For some odd reason the feeling doesn't change The source which was once your music Has changed to simply your surroundings now Or so it seems to have for now you are left in silence And the rest of the lonely is like a broken heart A single solitary player of a single solitary instrument For now you are confused as you look to your right And you see a new set of blue eyes looking at you There is no love, no lust, no admiration nor exhilaration But at the same time there is no hard heart behind them For that heart listens to the music of your voice Not the mistakes of your hands nor your lack of charm Impressions irrevocably riveted in place eons ago But deeper more purging ideas planted by your music The music of your heart, the music of your soul For the mind knows not what the heart sees And the mind never could comprehend what the ear hears The pale icy cold metallic blue irises never shall lie Just like the chords in our music \nnever lie If only the iris would last longer then the chords And if only the iris was as harmless as the chords New Start The time to weep has not passed The days and night not gone fast But now you see a new one near And it's that which you fear The feelings aren't quite the same But it's your heart that does claim That times gone by aren't to stay It is this time this very day That hurt shall no longer rest Where love and kindness fit the best For in those eyes you did see What it was that would set you free Free from the pain and misery of your past Free from the love that did not last Free from the strings tied to your heart That were there right from the start And free from the green stars in her eyes For it was those stars that made you cry And now you look into another's blue iris And it's her cheek you now kiss Your heart still isn't all what it once was But know you've past that feeling so remiss Neither love nor pain now has hold of you But a happy confusion of what is true You know not what your heart really feels But you recognize the absence of what was real And now when you kiss a hand your heart doesn't ache And when you get a hug your heart doesn't break For now in your eyes you see not a heart Now in her eyes you see a fresh new start Quantum's From the deepest trenches of the lake A small bright light emerges A tempest of blue and white all at once Just in the one tiny photon

keep you satisfied That light no matter how small is magnificent Always has been, always will be Even if it does come in different quantities Because regardless of where the light comes from It's

the rate an animal expends energy just to stay alive while at rest can be measured in calories per hour not surprisingly, larger animals require more energy to maintain their bodies than smaller ones so larger animals have a higher basal metabolic rate, and have to eat more total calories per day just to stay alive but as we look at animals with larger and larger bodies, the metabolic rate (calories per hour) rises more slowly than the body weight that is, a larger animal needs fewer calories per pound of body weight than a smaller animal so a smaller animal has to eat more relative to its body weight so smaller animals generally have to concentrate on foods with a high caloric payoff while larger animals can eat foods with a lower caloric content think of hummingbirds, eating high-sugar flower nectar all animals would be happy to subsist on such high-quality food, but there just is not enough of it around, or it is distributed in packages too small, to support a large-bodied animal while elephants eat leaves, straw, woody plant parts these require that the elephant eat them in large quantities and digest them for some time these foods have fewer calories per pound of food but are widely available, so a large animal with a lower requirement of calories per pound of body weight can find enough but a small animal could not stuff enough of these foods into its body at one time to get the calories it needed activity requires additional energy, so a typical animal might need to eat enough to provide twice its basal metabolic rate so a very active animal needs more food than one that moves slowly growing requires additional energy you all know that growing children need to eat a lot gestating (being pregnant) requires additional energy gestation increases a female's caloric needs up to 25% the additional calories required increase from almost none right after conception, to about 25% of the female's normal requirement as birth approaches lactating (producing milk) requires even more than pregnancy lactation increases a female's caloric needs about 50% she is \"eating for two\" (or really \"one and a half\") in addition to energy (calories) the diet also needs to include enough protein (amino acids), vitamins, minerals, some elements (like iron) calories are provided by carbohydrates, fats, and oils and the diet should not have too much of any chemicals that are toxic or impede digestion like most mammals, primates also need to drink water most need water at least once a day Food sources: different primates concentrate on many different foods most primates each many different foods, often 50 or more kinds but each species emphasizes certain foods more than others primates (and other animals) need two general categories of foods some foods that provide carbohydrates other foods that provide protein most prosimians get carbohydrates from gum and fruit protein from insects most anthropoids get carbohydrates from fruit protein from insects or young leaves most primates are fairly focussed on certain types of foods see chart on page 174 to get an idea of the variation in primate diets chimps eat mostly fruit, with smaller amounts of leaves, insects, very occasional meat, etc. Bushbabies (or galagos), a kind of prosimian, get 70% of their diet from insects, 20% from fruit, and 10% from gum Spider monkeys get 80% of their diet from fruit, and 20% from leaves Langurs get about 65% of their diet from leaves, 25% from fruit, and 10% from flowers etc. while one type of food usually predominates, most primates do eat a variety of foods unlike many other animals, they are not highly specialized on one particular kind of food categories of food specializations: insectivore : insect eater insectivores are usually small insects provide good quality, rapidly digestible food, but in small packages larger animals would have trouble getting enough food if they depended on insects unless they had some highly efficient method of getting a lot of them, like the long, specialized tongue of an anteater while small animals have to depend on rapidly digestible food, because of their relatively higher metabolic rate they simply can't eat enough volume of low-quality food to get the calories they need insectivores typically have high, pointy cusps on the teeth, including the molars, for breaking into the insect's tough exoskeletons short, simple digestive tract gummivore : plant gum eater gummivores are also usually small same reasons as insectivores gummivores typically have sturdy incisors, and sometimes canines, that stick forward and are shaped for gouging into bark and scraping off gum frugivore : fruit eater frugivores tend to be intermediate in size fruits have fewer calories per pound than do insects and gum, but are still much better than leaves and other plant parts fruit is typically more widely available, and in larger package sizes, than insects and gum frugivores typically have wide incisors for scraping out the meat of fruits from their rinds low, rounded molar cusps for pulverizing fruit often have large stomachs to hold the bulky leaves and other plant parts they eat along with the fruit folivore : leaf eater (\" \nfoliage\") folivores tend to be intermediate to large in size leaves offer relatively few calories per pound, but are very plentiful but an animal has to be relatively large to physically process enough leaves and must have relatively lower caloric needs per pound of body weight folivores typically have sharp, ridged molars for shearing leaves into small bits long, more specialized digestive tract for processing a lot of leaves often with a specialized section to house microorganisms that break down cellulose often with a very large stomach to hold the large volumes of leaves required to get enough calories notice that there are no primate carnivores (unless you count insects as \"meat\") some primates occasionally eat some other vertebrates, but it is not a predominant part of the diet Food distribution most primates live in tropical forests where there are many different kinds of trees, but often

Pasteur (1857-1876) There is no spontaneous generation Some microorganisms can live in the absence of oxygen You can grow microorganisms on a defined medium The acidity of a medium affects how microorganisms grow Organisms evolve to fill biological niches Characteristics are inherited Microorganisms have nutritional requirements Protozoa can cause disease Herr Koch (1876-1888) Some bacteria

different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten to open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first \ninto the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions from a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and \npainter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later from someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.6591901779174805],["X1011726803-00038-10270</DOCNO> Wynonna Web - revelations

between us now In each step I take, with each prayer I make This love will live somehow Let the mountains rise I will climb them all When my body's weak, I will not fall Baby come what may I'll find a way to get through There's nothing that I won't do To be loved by you There will be lonely nights When you'll whisper my name Know on those lonely nights, I'll be doing the same Should every star in

you get some life insurance And be prepared to call 911 Pay close attention to your high blood pressure And stay away from the man with the gun You need a reason to get up in the mornin' Make sure you

not a thing in the world that my money can't buy I can't understand why you didn't even try So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill You can't blame me because you're underfed You should be glad that you've got a roof over your head If you worked for a living you could pay your rent Instead of begging me for help when all you're money's spent You won't ever fool me because I know your type I see you standing on the corner like a parasite You're a loser and you know it but you don't even care I can't understand why you say life ain't fair So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill Pay the bill pay the bill the next generation has to pay the bill The next generation has to pay pay the bill Give me one good reason why I shouldn't complain I've done everything I can but it's still the same I've got nothing to lose so why should I give a fuck My life's a piece of shit and that's where I'm stuck I never got a fair chance to even prove myself So tell me why should I be nice to anybody else You say you can't understand why I say life is a bitch I can't understand how you can be so rich So what do you mean we've got the same possibilities I haven't even got your educational abilities I dropped out of school before I took me degree Cos the welfare line made more sense to me I try to work for a living so I can pay all my debts And I've come to realize this is as good as it gets I hate my fucking life more than you hate me I just can't understand why this is how it should be So I complain it's still the same We're standing still while the next generation has to pay the bill So I complain it's still the same We're standing still while the next generation has to pay the bill Pay the bill pay the bill the next generation has to pay, pay the bill 3: Pin Me Down I try to hide and deny my inner thoughts and true reactions By fooling myself with ill-concealed dissatisfaction I can't take it any more I can't stand the situation I don't want to be a victim of another confrontation I'll pretend that I know I need you to sympathize I'm so unsure of myself so please don't you criticize You can bend me and shake me you can twist me till I break And whatever you do I'll take the blame for your mistakes Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out You want to shape me up so that you can mould me in You want to fold me out just so you can fit me in You feed me full with your discriminating terrible lies What do you want from me should I believe in all your alibies I don't know where to go so which way should I turn I try to understand but you don't want me to learn You tie my feet to the ground there's not a chance that I can walk I want to scream but you gag my mouth so I can't talk Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out You want to stretch me out just so you can pin me down You want to dry me out just so you can watch me drown You want to watch me starve so you can force me to eat And then you knock me down when I'm back on my feet Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out 4: Waste My Time From the white man's mouth and the white man's tongue There's been hundreds of years of diabolical dung So much prejudice piss has been trickling down And I can smell the shit coming from miles around You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time I'm not white I'm punk the but colour of my face Represents a fucking farce called the superior face White power bullshit I'll wipe my pink fucking ass With your swastika flag cos it belongs to the past You want me to believe that dark skin is a sin Well wake up it's 95 where the fuck have you been What are you trying to achieve with your racist crap That shit's coming out the \ncrack from the bottom of your back You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time You are making me sick with your pathetic ricks You try to tell me different colours don't mix You tell us so many lies that you believe them yourself You spent your whole life blaming everyone else You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time 5: Die High Going down slow, how low can you get Before you break yourself and wake up in a sweat On the killing floor with the damage done You can pity yourself but your race is run You can climb the walls without reaching the top And the higher you feel the further you drop But you just want to get high Going one step further, slipping down the line You're living your life on borrowed time How much abuse can you take from yourself Is your addiction worth more than life itself When you make the bet you have to pay the debt And if you're lucky you can live with your own reget or you can get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high There's a lot of good reasons but no excuse You can never justify your drug abuse You can legalize the hit but the problems remain You still feel like shit the effect's the same You're wasting your time with that fucking crap The choice is yours and I can give you that And you still want to get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high You can never rely on the drugs you buy You can never deny all the tricks you try You can do anything just to get your fix You can try anything just to get your kicks You don't hesitate to cheat or lie And bad excuse is a good abili You say you hate yourself and you want to die But it's all the same you still want to get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high 6: It I can hear it in your voice I can see it in your eyes I can smell it in the air I can hear it in your sighs The way you look at me and the way that you act The way you make me feel I have to react Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more It's painful to see I can't take it any more I know what it is I can see it in my dreams I know what it's like I know what it means I can make it go away I can make it disappear I can make it right I can make it happen here Feels like I have to do it it has to be done It's time to get it over with it's useless to run It could have been something nice you said to me But I can hear it in your voice you just pity me You make fun out of me and every word that I say And I can hear you laugh when I walk away So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend You don't know who I am I'm not your friend You don't think I know but I can read between the lines Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs Nobody knows it and nobody can see I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when But it's happened before and it can happen again I want to do things to you that you'll never forget It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get 7: Do What I Say Don't to this don't do that Don't you ever talk back Don't speak with food in your mouth Just keep quiet while the grown ups are talking I'm not being mean I'm just being fair It's just because I really care You know that I love you But shut your mouth you just have to do what I say I don't want you to lie You're much too old to cry You're just to young to know But when you're older you'll understand You are mine I own you Look at me I'm talking to you Don't use that tone to me So shut your mouth you just have to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way I've paid to raise you good \nDone everything I could so don't you dare to say That I ever cared about you anyway I gave you good food to eat I kept you on your feet I gave you all my good advice Not once did I hear you thank me for all that I've done You don't know anything About my suffering I went through a lot of pain Just to get you where you are today If I ever hit you It's because I have to You have done something wrong And you deserve the punishment, you'll have to pay When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way Don't ask me why not Be glad with what you've got DOn't tell me you're alone You should be glad that you have a home Just look me in the eyes You have to realize I make the rules that's it It's for your own good so you have to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way 8: Undone When I was young I was taught to throw sticks and stones Because sticks and stones they could break your bones The only way to get ahead that made any kind of sense Was to enrich myself at other people's expense I could walk over corpses to make myself a name I would cheat and I could lie without showing no shame People tried to stop me but they didn't understand I wasn't looking for affection or a helping hand Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why I never told the truth cos I believe all my lies I believed that if I made my own alibis I would find a good reason and a better excuse So I could justify my hate and my self abuse I would satisfy myself in any way I could Because I knew that I would always be misunderstood I did a lot of mean things that are hard to forgive But all I ever wanted was a life to live Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why Looking back at my life there's a lot I regret I made a lot of mistakes that I can never forget But I didn't know better I was insecure I guess I never took care of my problems before I feel bad about the people that I pushed around I feel bad about the people that I let down I put the blame on myself I can't look the other way Living with my guilt is the price I have to pay Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why 9: What Are

domestic sewage and animal wastes Oxygen-demanding wastes: organic wastes which can be aerobically decomposed by bacteria DO (dissolved oxygen) - oxygen content BOD (biological oxygen demand) - amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic decomposers to break down the organic material in a certain volume of water over a 5-day period Inorganic plant nutrients: water-soluble nitrate and phosphate compounds that can cause excess growth of algae and aquatic vegetation Organic chemicals: oil, gasoline, plastics, pesticides, cleaning solvents, detergents and many other water-soluble and insoluble chemicals Sediment or suspended matter: insoluble particles of soil and other solid inorganic and organic materials Radioactive substances: radioisotopes that are water soluble or capable of being biologically amplified to higher concentrations as they pass through food chains and webs Heat: excess input of water that is heated - used mostly to cool electrical power plants Sources of pollution: Point: pollution discharged at specific locations through pipes, ditches, or sewers into bodies of surface waterNonpoint: big land areas that discharge pollutants into surface and underground waters Stream and river pollution - usually recover rapidly from heat and oxygen-demanding wastes due to flow - often not a major concern - cities get their drinking water upstream and discharge sewage downstream Lake pollution - less flow for dilution and mixing - stratification prevents mixing, resulting in excess nutrient loading - cultural eutrophication - input of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) accelerated by human activities Prevention methods: use advanced waste treatment to remove phosphates from effluents ban or set low limits on phosphates for detergents and cleaning products control land uses, use sound soil conservation practices protect coastal and inland wetlands that filter and retain nutrients Cleanup Methods: dredge bottom sediments to remove excess nutrients remove or harvest excess weedscontrol nuisance plants with herbicides and algicidespump air through lakes to avoid oxygen depletion Ocean pollution: the ultimate sink for much of the waste matter produced can dilute, disperse, and degrade large amounts of sewage, sludges, oil, and some types of industrial waste, especially in deep waters marine organisms tend to be more resilient to exposure about 2 million birds and 100,000 marine mammals die when they ingest or become entangled in plastic cups, bags, six-pack yolks, nets, ropes, and other forms of trash 80% dredge spoils - materials scraped from the bottoms of harbors and shipping channels 20% sewage sludges - mixture of toxic chemicals, infectious agents, and settled solids removed from wastewater at sewage treatment plants Oil pollution: most actually comes from waste oils disposed onto the lands by individuals, industries, and cities - tanker accidents and well blowouts most visible but account for only about 20% Groundwater pollution: most groundwater is renewed so slowly that any contamination may be considered permanent natural removal of bacteria and suspended solid particles as water percolates through soils into aquifers slow flow, cold temperatures, and lack of oxygen greatly extends time from wastes to degrade Preventing contamination may be the only effective way to protect groundwater by banning virtually all disposal of hazardous wastes in sanitary landfills and injection wells monitoring of existing landfills and wells for leakage placing stricter controls on chemical applications establishing national groundwater standards Controlling surface water pollution: Nonpoint source: primarily agricultural - reduce excess fertilizer and pesticide use, control feedlot runoff, reforest watersheds Point source: wastewater lagoons - large ponds where air, sunlight, and microorganisms can break down wastes septic systems primary sewage treatment - mechanical screening of debris such as sticks, stones, rags secondary sewage treatment - aerobic bacteria degrade and remove up to 90% of biodegradable oxygen-demanding organic waste advanced sewage treatment - specialized chemical and physical processes that lower the quantities of specific pollutants US Water Pollution Control Laws Safe Drinking Water Act (1974): required EPA to establish maximum contamination levels for any pollutant that \"may\" have adverse effects on human health: 97 cause cancer, 82 mutations, 28 toxic, 23 promote tumors - by 1993 only 84 of 700+ set Federal Water Pollution Act of 1972 (renamed the Clean Water Act of 1977) and 1987 Water Quality Act: established to control pollution of surface waters required EPA to set standards for effluents and monitoring

complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA and bind they then act as the \"starting site\" for new DNA synthesis Given a mix of nucleotides, the right enzymes, and energy, the primers will initiate synthesis of complementary DNA strands note that, for every double-stranded DNA fragment used, two copies are produced - just like in \"normal\" DNA replication in cells Then, the process is repeated: each new double-stranded DNA fragment is denatured, primers are added, etc. so the process is exponential: with each round of the process, the number of DNA fragments is doubled This technique has been very useful in many fields: in forensics, small amounts of DNA can be fingerprinted to help identify perpetrators in medicine, if we know what genes we're looking for, PCR allows us to detect even very low levels of viral DNA or DNA from cancer cells from blood samples in other areas of science, we can use PCR to analyze DNA from very small tissue samples, e.g. from ancient human bones, from insects in amber, etc. Manipulating genes: recombinant DNA technology Recombinant DNA = a DNA molecule that contains pieces that aren't found together in nature - examples include adding human genes to bacteria to generate usable proteins modifying viral DNA to make safer vaccines introduction of human genes to goats produces goats that secrete valuable proteins in their milk Gene therapy: providing \"good\" copies of genes to \"cure\" genetic diseases Once the desired gene has been isolated and synthesized, it needs to be incorporated into a vector = a system for transferring the gene into the target organism/cells/tissues two commonly-used vectors are plasmids and retroviruses using a plasmid vector to transform bacteria: selelct a plasmid that has a specific antibiotic-resistance gene use a restriction enzyme to cut the plasmid in such a way as to produce \"sticky ends\" that match the \"sticky ends\" of the DNA use DNA ligase to seal the DNA into the plasmid expose bacteria to transformed plasmids - some bacteria will take up the plasmids, some won't plate the bacteria on media containing the antibiotic to which the transformed plasmids are resistant bacteria lacking the recombinant plasmid will die, leaving behind bacteria that have successfully incorporated the recombinant plasmid Plasmid vectors can also be used with plant cells to

his thoughts of girls and how to meet them consume many of his waking hours only later after he has accepted this blind date his first does the girl's nationality cause him alarm anxiety intrudes into his eager expectations grows stronger as the afternoon comes to a close by early evening he is almost ready to call it off -- all afternoon he has remembered what his father has written into the family's Bible -- in memory of my dear father killed by the Germans in memory of my dear mother killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Elijahu his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Tsilia her husband and three children killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Chaim his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Hannah and her husband killed by the Germans in memory of my cousins aunts and uncles killed by the Germans his mother's family had suffered a similar fate the only survivor of the nearly hundred relatives was his father's youngest sister her husband and two sons who had survived by hiding in a cramped place too low to stand upright liberated by the Russians so weak and stooped none of them could stand up straight memories he hadn't thought about for years flood him - his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork

soon as we had a day off it turned into winter for a while every precious moment the new cd is done thank god and all his helpers its nice to be able to breath again and not smell tape head s burning in the air i will be gining to dist them in 8 days were going to have a party so check the schedule page for the anoucement the web site is about to change quite a bit bro kevin management has been hard at work upgrading the site and it will be unvailed as soon as we get the cds 8 days sooooo ihope ual dig the new old tunes and well keep the pot boiling hoping to conjur up some more ecuses to fall away from the day to day well talk soon piece kpk 08/30/99 i dont really know what to say this part of the journey has come to aan end im putting down the last track of gtr for the new cd which has become a very old friend tomarrow u heard me right the cd is basiclly done we have to mix at dr caws but weve been mixing all along so it wont taake that long i ve been told its about a thirty day

lethal diseases known to man fig 30.8 Include Ebola virus with lethality of over 90% Outbreak in 1995 threatened to spread worldwide A Viral Case Study: HIV AIDS first reported in U.S. in 1982 Infectious agent: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Closely related to African green monkey virus Etiology of the disease Affected individuals have no resistance to infection Rarely survive more than a few years, die of otherwise nonlethal diseases Transfer of body fluids poses most significant threat Incidence growing rapidly Clinical symptoms do not develop until after long period \nof latency How HIV compromises the immune system Normally a series of cells patrols bloodstream for invaders These cells are destroyed in AIDS patients, most specifically T4 cells The HIV infection cycle fig 30.9 Attachment HIV infects only T4 cells fig 30.10 Infects T4 cell by recognizing glycoprotein surface marker HIV glycoprotein precisely fits CD4 protein on T4 surface Cells lacking CD4 cannot be infected Entry Penetrates cell membrane, enters cell via endocytosis Protein coat shed Replication Single strand RNA with reverse transcriptase enzyme inside cell Viral RNA made into double-stranded DNA via reverse transcriptase Double-stranded DNA inserts itself into chromosomes of T4 cell Infected cell can remain latent or become active Latent cell: incorporates viral DNA into cell genome Active cell: virus directs production of copies of its genome Cell dies and lyses New viruses released to infect other T4 cells Latent cell can become active at later time Trigger to activate unknown, but associated with infections Latent cell activated by external stimuli Ultraviolet radiation Chemicals and carcinogens Other kinds of viruses Retroviruses (HIV) contain both RNA and reverse transcriptase Other viruses (cold virus) contain RNA but not reverse transcriptase Work without enzyme by using host's ribosomes and using RNA like mRNA Other viruses contain DNA: herpesviruses (cold sores and genital herpes), papillomaviruses (warts) Viruses: Particles of Genomes Origin as fragments of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes explains diversity New forms of viruses are evolving continuously THE BACTERIA Bacteria Are a Unique Group of Living Organisms Represent the oldest form of life fig 4.11 Only representatives of the prokaryotes Used to be classified as the only member of the kingdom Monera Present classification identifies two kingdoms of bacteria Archaebacteria Eubacteria Bacteria Are an Extremely Diverse Group of Organisms fig 30.11 Few major structural differences Species differentiation based on metabolic processes Characterized by growth on certain defined media Activities altered by growth conditions and chemicals Role of Bacteria Responsible for creating properties of atmosphere and soils Are autotrophic, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic, contribute to world carbon balance Are heterotrophic and break down organic compounds Only a few genera of bacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen Involved in industrial processes and chemical syntheses Produce acetic acid, vinegar, amino acids, enzymes Production of various milk products, bread and ethanol Antibiotics derived from bacterial sources Genetic engineering applications PROKARYOTES VERSUS EUKARYOTES Structural Differences Multicellularity: bacteria are fundamentally single-celled fig 30.11e, 12 May adhere within matrix, some form filaments Few integrated activities between cells Primitive colonial forms include gliding bacteria fig 30.11d Cell size: extremely small individual cell size Chromosomes: non-membrane bound DNA is circular and lacks proteins Cell division and genetic recombination Simple division via binary fission True sexual reproduction absent, genetic recombination irregular Internal compartmentalization: Lack membrane-bound organelles Enzymes are bound to cell membrane Only organelles present are ribosomes Flagella: possess simple flagella fig 30.1a,c,13 Composed of single flagellin fiber Lack 9 + 2 structure of eukaryotic flagella and cilia fig 5.26 Flagellar motion resembles spinning propeller, not whip-like motion Metabolic Diversity: Eukaryotes exhibit only one form of photosynthesis Bacteria exhibit several patterns of photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic Bacteria undergo chemosynthesis and fix atmospheric nitrogen BACTERIAL STRUCTURE Cell Wall Structure Polysaccharide network with polypeptide crosslinks fig 30.14 Classed as gram-positive or gram-negative Gram-positive composed of polysaccharide network Gram-negative have additional lipopolysaccharide chains Gram-negative are less susceptible to antibiotics May be surrounded by gelatinous capsule General Morphology Cell shape Rod-shaped: bacilli Spherical: cocci Spirally coiled: spirilla Some form stalked structures that give rise to spores fig 30.11d After division individual cells may adhere forming chains Cyanobacteria regularly form large filamentous masses fig 30.12 Connected by outer walls or gelatinous sheaths May exhibit coordinated gliding or rotational movements Rigid, helical flagella composed of flagellin protein fig 5.8 Hairlike pili function in attachment and identification fig 30.13 Thick-walled endospores fig 30.15 Resistant to desiccation Resistant to heat, killed only by extremely high temperatures BACTERIAL VARIATION Mutation One in 200 bacteria will have mutant characteristics fig 30.16 Many mutants result from great number of individual cells Rapid multiplication in short time period Increase number with favorable mutations Rapidly changes characteristics of a population Plays important role in genetic diversity Example: development of antibiotic resistance Genetic Recombination Transfer of genes via viruses, plasmids, other DNA fragments Examples Rapid transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids Transfer of pathogenic characteristics among enteric bacteria Rapid generation time is an alternative evolutionary strategy BACTERIA AS PLANT PATHOGENS Cause Costly Plant Diseases Symptoms are generally spots on stems, leaves or fruit Include blights, soft rots and wilts Most pathogens are rod-shaped pseudomonads fig 30.11a Example: Citrus Canker Caused by pseudomonad Xanthomonas campestris Introduced from abroad, causes serious economical damage in Florida BACTERIA AS HUMAN PATHOGENS Cause Many Human Diseases tbl 30.1 Examples: cholera, leprosy, tetanus, bacterial pneumonia, whooping cough, diphtheria Generally related to one of several genera Streptococcus: pneumonia, scarlet and rheumatic fevers fig 30.1b Staphylococcus: cause widespread infections Many bacterial diseases spread through food or water Insect vectors spread diseases like typhus Humans can contract disease from drinking cow milk, causes brucellosis in animals Tuberculosis One-third of all people worldwide infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Eight million new cases each year, three million deaths Leading cause of death from a single infectious agent Eradication programs dismantled in U.S. in 1980's Experiencing a dramatic resurgence of the disease Complicated by social factors, declining public health infrastructure Associated with prevalence of HIV Multidrug resistant strains of TB are developing Dental Caries Causes tooth decay and cavities Dental plaque composed of bacteria and polysaccharide matrix Involves many species of bacteria High sugar diets harmful Bacteria convert sugars to lactic acid Acid destroys hard tissue of tooth Control via fluoride by retarding loss of calcium Sexually Transmitted Diseases STDs caused by bacteria and viruses Viral STDs have no cure Bacterial STDs \nfrequently mutate to drug-resistant strains Gonorrhea Most prevalent communicable disease, cause by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium Transmitted during sexual activities through transfer of body fluids Can spread to eyes (conjunctivitis) and internal organs, cause arthritic meningitis Symptoms in women and men are generally mild and go unnoticed Treatment via combination of antibiotics Syphilis Less common as a result of blood-screening procedures and antibiotic treatment Caused by spirochaete bacterium, Treponema palladum Transmitted during intercourse, direct contact with sore or from mother to fetus Disease progresses in four distinct stages Primary stage characterized by chancre sore, highly infectious stage Secondary stage distinguished by body rash Third stage shows no symptoms, may last years Fourth stage is heart disease, mental deficiency, nerve damage, loss of motor functions, blindness Treated via antibiotics Genital herpes Caused by two types of closely related viruses Herpes simplex Type 1 causes cold sores and fever blisters Herpes simplex type 2 causes genital lesions of genital herpes Transmitted through sexual contact when open sores are evident Herpes virus in body travels along nerve endings to base of spine May remain dormant with no symptoms May become active and produce painful symptoms Initial outbreak produces measle-like lesions, flu-like symptoms May become dormant, outbreaks reappear with stress or exposure to sun Antiviral drugs can lessen severity of outbreaks, not a cure Transmission possible during outbreaks Chlamydia \"Silent STD\" caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium Has both bacterial and viral characteristics Susceptible to antibiotics like bacterium Depends on host cell to replicate, like virus Transmitted via sexual intercourse Women usually do not experience symptoms until infection is established Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease Can lead to sterility, increase risk of acquiring HIV Symptoms in men include watery discharge, burning or itching Tests exist to identify bacteria in discharge Treatment via antibiotics mostly tetracycline, penicillin not effective Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Transmission through contact with infected person fig 30.17 More than 30 strains, three known to cause cervical cancer Warts appear in genital region three weeks to three months after exposure Treatment through various agents to remove warts Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Archaebacteria are distinctly different from all other bacteria Base sequences of rRNA virtually identical in all members Differ from sequences in other bacteria and eukaryotes Cell walls lack muramic acid Have distinctive membranes, unusual cell walls, unique metabolic cofactors Capable of living in anaerobic atmosphere rich in CO2 and H2 Include oldest life forms, ancestral to Eubacteria and eukaryotes Independent evolution of each group Some have ribosomes similar to eukaryotes Others have smaller ribosomes like Eubacteria Include methanogens that produce methane gas Produce marsh gas, natural gas and reduce elemental sulfur Produce own anaerobic environment, cannot function in presence of oxygen Include other bacteria able to survive in inhospitable environments Thermoacidophiles Hot springs, deep sea thermal vents Use hydrogen sulfide as energy source Halophiles Salt-loving bacteria Use salt to generate ATP SIMPLE BUT VERSATILE ORGANISMS Simple Organisms with Diverse

farewell in the middle of everything under no particular spell i am dreaming of the mountains where the children learn the stars clouds roll in from nebraska dark chords on a big guitar my restlessness is long gone i would stand here like an old jack pine but I'm looking for rexroth's daughter the friend of a friend of mine i can't believe your hands and mouth did all that to me are so daily naked for all the world to see that thunderstorm in michigan i never will forget we shook right with the thunder & with the pounding rain got wet where did you turn when you turned from me with your arms across your chest i am looking for rexroth's daughter i saw her in the great northwest would she have said it was the wrong time if I had found her then i don't want too much a field across the road and a few good friends she used to come & see me but she was always there & gone even the very longest love does not last too long she'd stand there in my doorway smoothing out her dress & say \"this life is a thump-ripe melon--so sweet and such a mess\" i wanted to get to know you but you said you were shy i would have followed you anywhere but hello rolled into goodbye i just stood there watching as you walked along the fence beware of them that look at you as an experience you're back out on the highway with your poems of city heat & I'm looking for rexroth's daughter here on my own side street the murderer who lived next door seemed like such a normal guy-- if you try to follow what they shove at us you run out of tears to cry i heard a man speak quietly i listened for a while he spoke from his heart to my woe & then he bowed & smiled what is real but compassion as we move from birth to death i am looking for rexroth's daughter & I'm running out of breath spring will come back i know it will & it will do its best so useful so endangered like a lion or a breast i think about my children when i look at any child's face & pray that we will find a way to get with all this amazing grace it's so cold out there tonight so stormy i can hardly see & i'm looking for rexroth's daughter & i guess i always will be Real Good Friend i can't say don't go but i can't say go i can't say stay we both know we both know you're going & we both know why but i can't say don't go i can't say goodbye i can't say hold me i wish i could i'm feeling so cold & you're looking so good but it aint to be you got a good man ok god we're gonna follow your plan i can't say come to \nme but i can't say leave one thing i can say i can say believe believe i'll love you until the end long

on that raggedyass old cotton nightgown oh babe you make me sleepy since we first met & i gave you that twirl i know nothing can defeat me not as long as you're my girl oh babe you make me sleepy & in your arms i sleep so fine so well do you meet me & you can wake me any time oh babe i ain't that sleepy Blue Car i'm driving my blue car baby down from the mountain so high i'm driving my blue car baby coming down to say goodbye the sunrise is a miracle but it can't hold a candle to you do you remember them rides in my blue car back when \nit was brand new well it's a good old car but the clutch is a little loose and the brakes are screaming a song called what's the use but it's good for one more trip one more trip to you the lightning's meant to strike the tall pine trees & the birds are meant to cry & wheel in the breeze but some things baby i guess they just ain't meant to be when i get back up on the mountain i'll close my door against the wind i'll park my old blue car i may

contains Blood vessels Peyer's patches (lymph nodes) in the submucosa - protect us from disease muscularis - smooth muscle layer - 2 layers of smooth muscle - inner = encircles the Gut - outer layer - longitudinal layer lies in the same direction as the gut serosa - serous membrane layer - thin outermost layer of squamous epitheliurn Supported by connective tissue Serosa secretes serous fluid that keeps the outer surface of the intestines moist So that the organs of the abdominal cavity slide against one another Outer layer of the esophagus is composed only of loose connective tissue Called adventitia Stomach - sac-like organ composed of the fundus (upper,rounded part ), body (main portion), and antrum (lower part) Rugae - as in the mouth, are folds in the mucosal lining Glands within the rugae secrete gastric juices that aids in digestion and forms a Protective coating on the lining of the stomach pylorus - narrow passage which connects the stomach with the small intestine Pyloric sphincter - muscle that controls the flow between the stomach and the Duodenum Columnar epithelium has gastic pits which lead to gastric glands, produce gastric juice Gastric juice contains pepsin - digests protein Also HCI and mucous HCI - gives the stomach its acidity - pH =2 which helps kill most bacteria Present in food, it does not digest food but does break down Connective tissue found in meat and activates pepsin Mucous secreted by the goblet cells protects the stomach lining from the acidity If the HCI penetrates the mucous, the wall can begin to break down - it is now believed That Helicobacter pylon (bacteria) impairs the ability of epithelial cells to Produce the protective mucous Stomach absorbs alcohol but not food - food leaves the stomach as a thick soupy Liquid called chyme - chyme leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine Small Intestines - small bowel - extends from the stomach to the large intestines 3 parts: Duodenum 1 st portion - from the pylorus to the jejunum Jejunum - middle portion - from the duodenum to the ileum Ileum - last portion - from the jejunum to the cecum of the large intestine Ileocecal vale - between the ileum and the large intestines - prevents backflow of waste Controlled by ileocecal sphincter Bile is secreted into the small intestine from the liver and pancreatic juice is secreted into the small intestine from the pancreas - bile emulsifies fat Into droplets to disperse in water pH of the small intestine is slightly basic to neutralize the chyme enzymes from the pancreas help complete the digestion process The surface area of the wall of the small intestine is approximately that of a tennis court due to fingerlike projections called villi and additional projections called microvilli this is for maximum absorption of nutrients into the cardiovascular (glucose and fatty acids) system and lymphatic (fats) system Regulation of digestive hormones: Although the nervous system plays a part in the secretion of digestive juices - so do hormones hormones - substance produced by one set of cells that affects a different set of cells Called target cells if one eats a meal rich in protein - stomach produces the hormone gastrin - enters the Bloodstream - soon the stomach begins churning, and the secretory activity of Gastric glands increases duodenal wall produces GIP (gastric inhibiting peptide) - works opposite from gatrin To inhibit gastrin secretion Also secretes secretin - whose release is stimulated by the HCI in the chyme And CCK - cholecystokinin - whose release is stimulated by partially Digested protein and fats Once \nthese hormones enter the bloodstream - the liver begins secreting bile into The small intestine and pancreas begins secreting pancreatic juices into The small intestine Large Intestine - from the small intestine to the anus 4 parts: Cecum - pouch that lies on the right side of the abdomen - from the ileum to the Colon Colon -3 parts: Ascending colon - cecum to the undersurface of the liver Transverse colon - passes horizontally to the left towards the Spleen Descending colon- travels down the left side of the abdominal Cavity to the signioid cavity Sigmoid colon ~3rd major part of the large intestine - from the descending colon To the rectum Rectum - last division of the large intestine Anus - lower opening of the gastrointestinal tract 2 anal sphincter muscles control the anus Defecation is the expulsion of feces - 3 quarters water, and ~ quarter solids The color is caused by the bilirubin and the odor is produced by the breaking Down of products as the bacteria work on the undigested material obligate anaerobes are the main bacteria present in the large intestine --they break Down undigestive food and produce vitamins and other molecules the large Intestine absorbs polyps - colon can develop polyps - small growths arising from the epithelial lining - can be Benign or cancerous - are surgically removable researchers believe increased fat intake can lead to cancer because of the increase in Bile secretion caused by fat also - increase in fiber intake decreases the chances of colon cancer - fiber absorbs water and adds bulk - diluting the concentration of bile salts and facilitating the Movement of substances through the intestine Regular elimination decreases the intestines exposure to cancer promoting Agents diarrhea - caused by infections of the lower tract and nervous stimulation each case the intestinal wall is stimulated due to irritation or nervous stimulation Peristalsis increases and water is not absorbed - resulting in diarrhea constipation - feces are dry and hard - many times resulting from one ignoring the urge to Defecate increased water and fiber intake can help prevent constipation Liver - located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (hepatic - pertaining to the liver) functions: Removes excess glucose from the bloodstream and stores it as glycogen Converts glycogen back to glucose when needed Destroys old erythrocytes (red blood cells) Removes poisons from the blood Manufactures some blood proteins Manufactures bile, digestive juices (stored on the gallbladder) Bilirubin is also released by the liver into the bile Removes bilirubin from the blood Produces lipids from fatty acids - produces and helps regulate cholesterol Produces urea from the breakdown of amino acids Stores iron and the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,and K) Jaundice - when bilirubin is deposited in the skin due to an abnormally large amount in The blood - person has yellowish tint to the whites of the eyes and the skin Hepatitis - inflammation if the liver - several forms of viral hepatitis A - get from sewage contaminated drinking water B - spread by sexual contact, blood transfilsions or contaminated needles More contagious than AIDS virus (Vaccine available) C - acquired by contact with infected blood - leads to chronic hep or liver cancer Cirrhosis - often due to alcoholism but not always Organ becomes fatty and the liver tissue is replaced by inactive fibrous scar tissue Liver can regenerate if the rate of regeneration exceeds the rate of damage if the liver Has not already reached the point of failure Gallbladder - pear shaped muscular sac attached to the bottom of the liver Stores and concentrates bile for later use - water is reabsorbed by the gallbladder so that the bile becomes a thick, mucous-like material - when bile is Needed it leaves the gallbladder and travels down the common bile duct and Enters the duodenum cholesterol can come out of the bile solution and crystalize in the gallbladder and form Gallstones - cholelithiasis - the stones can block the common bile duct -",0.6185575723648071],["Blue-green algae and some bacteria

baby you can rob a bank or hold up a 7-11 you can shoplift merchandise and still buy your way into heaven all you need is a valid excuse they'll tell you it's a sin to steal but you're only as guilty as you feel just don't do what the bad people do you can get away with anything if you do it for love you can get away with anything if you do it but just make sure you're doing it you can get away with anything if you do it for love absolution comes from within but love alone can save your soul from sin just don't do what the bad people do do it for love and only for love not for money or for power or some God up above no judge or jury ever can convict you, son I WAS CONFUSED (ABOUT THE TELEVISION SET) (Slavens, Muller, Brand) I watched the news just the other day and there's just one thing that I must say it gave me a pain right in the middle of my head the newsman came on with his face and told me about the big disgrace let me know just how many people got dead and I got down, it brought me down so I got up and turned it off that left me alone with my thoughts and a great big pain right in the middle of my head and I was confused I didn't know what to do I watched a show just the other night and I must say something was not right how come people on television's weird in the head well they won't show sex but they show a lot of killing guess it must be better to show blood spilling than to let little junior see two naked people in bed EAST COAST JONES (Slavens) back home it's the same things are very slow to change by the time the news comes in from L.A. the latest fad is already passe (hey, hey) the clothes and the music and the latest phrase tomorrow has the reek of yesterday everybody wants to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play back here it's the same everything is up to date they say build it up, buy it up, eat it up fast it's made for looks but it ain't made to last buy a nice house buy a nice car junior executives born to be a star if you want \nto be in fashion you'll have to pay the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play out there it's the same except there ain't nobody knows your name 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'you can run but you can never hide' well you see all the same rules will still apply you'll still get low you know you'll still get high everybody runs to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play CRAWL (Slavens) crawl into another head stand up take a look around - tell me what you see crawl into another head now, when I was a baby I just couldn't understand why everybody didn't think like I did and it messed with my head it took me years to overcome it but I finally did when I took a little trip in someone else's head now, everybody tells me that I gotta have a world view well I listen very carefully but I don't always know what to do there's a lot of bogus causes phony ideologies but if you pick yourself the right one you can set your spirit free now, I am on the right side maybe you are on the left side and we're looking at the same thing but we're looking at it differently I guess I'm talking about perspective but it's different from that if you can walk around with someone else's brain under your hat it's a very simple reason and a lot of people learn it but a lot of people close their minds to certain information they are trying to avoid any unwanted stimulation that might make them reevaluate the values that they live by CASTLE ON THE HILL (Slavens) gotta wonder how you sleep at night with the front door locked and the windows drawn up tight in your castle up on the hill baby, baby, do you know what I mean there's a great big world that I know you've never seen from your castle up on the hill You built it brick by brick and locked yourself inside you're sitting safe in a great big fortress but I don't know what you're hiding from I guess you're worried that you might find out that you've been missing what your life is all about while you're sitting in your castle on the hill if you ask me you're just a victim of your own devices money and security will not suffice go out and get a real life break out of the castle on the hill THE BUFFALO CLUB (Slavens) I don't belong to the Buffalo Club but I sure would like to wake up in the morning and find out it's all been a terrible dream does anybody see it as a warning have you been out there on the street pretty lights above your head pretty bricks beneath your feet clean off the spray paint on the walls clean the kids and clean their minds until there's nothing left to clean except the sky have you been checking out the changes I hear so many names I see so many different faces all the suffering from the same disease did you find out young that life is short and try to take the easy way out there's no easy way out how I wish that I could be naive I long to be taken in tricked into believing again OLD EYES (Slavens) I met you in an earlier time we had just one thing in common that was the only thing in my life I remember that one spring day when we drove out in the country flying past houses, farms and fields I would give anything to be with you again I would give anything to hear you call my name I would give anything to see your smiling face to see you with my old eyes that wasn't so long ago when we were both quite naive oh the things that I believed I remember the summer with you when we lived out in the country so much life and so much time time is changing now my life is rearranged there's so much trouble we got lost I could not find you had to leave you far behind but I will be with you again ALLIGATOR BRAIN (Slavens, Muller) taste of blood on my lips cold spot in my heart man of action plan of action no reaction cold spot in my heart there's a cold spot in my heart if I love you I can hurt you cold spot in my heart everything that you say can be used in a cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart the knife cuts my heart bleeds please don't push me baby, there's a cold spot in my heart just can't be responsible for tearing you apart when I'm in my alligator brain I see my chance I make my move got a cold spot I've got a cold spot in my heart once I'm in motion there is no devotion just one cold emotion cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart LOVE IS THE QUESTION (Slavens) love is the question that my heart's been asking and you are the answer every night I go to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep if I have to climb a thousand mountains high I will be there for you, baby I will show you how to fly yeah, yeah, yeah won't you do it once for me cover me with kisses, baby YEAH RIGHT (Slavens, Muller) everybody's driving in their cars everybody's telling me \nboy you've gotta be a big star I don't listen to what they say I just concentrate on having a nice day and I say hey, hey, hey get outta my face changes coming 'round soon enough gonna put you all in your place so get yourself a job that pays real good find yourself a house in a nice neighborhood get some money in the bank and nothing bad will happen don't worry about the nightly news somebody else has got the blues you're on top and you can't lose nothing bad will happen ...yeah, right as it was it is and shall be evermore don't be too concerned about what the future has in store cuz you don't want to change it anyway well, this is how you dig it so this is how it stays and I say whoa, whoa, whoa maintain the status quo and don't tell me about changes, baby I don't want to know CAST OUT YOUR DEMONS (Slavens) everybody's talking talking all about you don't pretend that you don't know seems you got a problem you don't have to be too smart to guess it right on the nose something's got the better of you and it's sticking to your life like gum on your shoe Everybody's worried worried all about you wondering when you're gonna explode don't be too surprised if they all stand back and leave you alone to carry the load something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you you better cast out your demons everybody loves you everybody still cares about you even when you push them away but hey we're all human and you'll push it to the limit you'll wake up alone some day something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you I know it's gonna be hard but you better cast out your demons BYE-BYE (Slavens) I had a dream a particular scene though now it gets hard to remember you looked so real as you sat at the wheel the air smelled of early December I heard the sound of your voice remember Luanne I heard the sound of your voice say to me... bye-bye hope you remember my name when I'm gone bye-bye don't really know if it meant anything but I feel like a better man today it sounded so true that I knew it was you though I can't recall what you were saying if I was there you didn't seem to care when you spoke you were looking right through me I left school and I guess things got cool between you and our person in common but he was there too he went through it with you who's to say which one came out better UNDERWATER (Slavens, Muller, Brand, Emert) air all around but no water to be found I dance around but the surroundings don't suit me I'm looking for a familiar face I'm reaching for something but I don't know I'm on the outside now I'd love to get back in again I never should have jumped just lack of self discipline and I long to be back underwater once I was so safe and sound just floating all around and there was nothing much to do or see but I long to be back underwater All lyrics by Paul Slavens Musical Arrangements by Ten Hands Please click here to return to the Ten Hands

could have walked away myself my self worth was beyond any help and i didnt care to test it against the rejection i had seen before but those i loved so much they underwent a change they're working fourty hours they got caught in the game like junkies running dry, the vulnerability they're always there on time we're never satisfied like junkies running dry this wonderful generosity a third of our lives to do what we please doesn't look that great to me in fact it doesnt even look fair they call it youthful idealism and even I would have to agree with them except some of us grow up and its

me for a joke You took me for a child You took a long hard look at my ass And then played golf for a while Your shake is like a fish You pat me on the head You took me out to wine dine 69 me But didn't hear a damn word I said Repeat Chorus Hello Mr. Man You didn't think that I'd come back You didn't think I'd show up with my army And this ammunition on my back Now that I'm Miss Thing Now that I'm a zillionaire You scan the credits for your name And wonder why it's not there Repeat Chorus Forgiven You know how us Catholic girls can be We make up for so much time a little too late I never forgot it, confusing as it was No fun with no guilt feelings The sinners, the saviors, the loverless priests I'll see you next Sunday Chorus: We all had our reasons to be there We all had a thing or two to learn We all needed something to cling to So we did I sang Alleluia in the choir I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man My brothers they never went blind for what they did but I may as well have In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son I had one more stupid question Repeat Chorus What I learned I rejected but I believe again I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven Repeat Chorus We all had delusions in our head We all had our minds made up for us We had to believe in something So we did You Learn I

anyone I certainly do I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time Feel free throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind) Hold it up (to the rays) You wait and see when the smoke clear Repeat Chorus Wear it out (the way a three-year-old \nwould do) Melt it down (you're gonna have to eventually anyway) The fire trucks are coming up around the bend Repeat Chorus You grieve you learn You choke you learn You laugh you learn You choose you learn You pray learn You ask you learn You live you learn Head Over Feet I had no choice but to hear you You stated your case time and again I thought about it You treat me like I'm a princess I'm not used to liking that You ask how my day was Chorus: You've already won me over in spite of me Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are I couldn't help it It's all your fault Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole You're so much braved than I gave you credit for That's not lip service Repeat Chorus You are the bearer of unconditional things You held your breath and the door for me Thanks for your patience You're the best listener that I've ever met You're my best friend Best friend with benefits What took me so long I've never felt this healthy before I've never wanted something rational I am aware now I am aware now Repeat Chorus Mary Jane What's the matter Mary Jane, you had a hard day As you place the don't disturb sign on the door You lost your place in line again, what a pity You never seem to want to dance anymore It's a long way down On this roller coaster The last chance streetcar Went off the track and you're on it I hear you're counting sheep again Mary Jane What's the point of tryin' to dream anymore I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for Well it's full speed baby In the wrong direction There's a few more bruises If that's the way You insist on heading Please be honest Mary Jane Are you happy Please don't censor your tears You're the sweet crusader And you're on your way You're the last great innocent And that's why I love you So take this moment Mary Jane and be selfish Worry not about the cars that go by All that matters Mary Jane is your freedom Keep warm my dear, keep dry Tell me Tell me what's the matter Mary Jane... Ironic An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes late Isn't it ironic...don't you think Chorus: It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take Who would've thought...it figures Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye He waited his whole life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down he thought \"Well isn't this nice...\" And isn't it ironic...don't you think Repeat Chorus Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you When you think everything's okay and everything's going right And life has a funny way of helping you out when You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up In your face A traffic jam when you're already late A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife It's meeting the man of my dreams And then meeting his beautiful wife And isn't it ironic...don't you think A little too ironic...and yeah I really do think... Repeat Chorus Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out Helping you out Not The Doctor I don't want to be the filler if the void is solely yours I don't want to be your glass of single malt whiskey Hidden in the bottom drawer I don't want to be a bandage if the wound is not mine Lend me some fresh air I don't want to be adored for what I merely represent to you I don't want to be your babysitter You're a very big boy now I don't want to your mother I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months Show me the back door Chorus: Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6 well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and h Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor I don't want to be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon I don't want to be your other half I believe that 1 and 1 make 2 I don't want to be your food or the light from the

me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe, they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With ev'ry paper I'd deliver Bad news on the door step I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I creid When I read about this widowed bride Something touched me deep inside The day the music died, so *Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my chevy to the levy But the levy was dry Then good old boys Were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in god above If the bible tells you so Now do you believe in rock and roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me How to dance real slow Well I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Then I digged those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pick up truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died, I started singing (Repeat *) Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No vredict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practised in the park And we sang digges in the dark The day the music died, we were singin' (Repeat *) Helter Skelter in a summer swelter The birds fiew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin'fast Plant a flower on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the

like anger Is it loneliness that made you be that hard Still the lights from that far shore Seem to linger in the blood beneath those scars And it's not easy to remember in the city That there's Someone who's still lighting the stars And that there's Nothing in this world shines brighter than the hope of heaven No love that can touch you deeply as His Nothing big enough to keep you down unless you let it Nothing you can buy or sell that's good as what He freely gives I feel the wind cut through the alley just to slice you Like a razor running down your veins How the devil uses hatred to entice you Don't play a losing hand in his game Don't give up when all the others seem to mock you Though you feel your spirit's starting to wane Because there's Nothing in this world shines brighter than the hope of heaven No love that can touch you deeply as His Nothing big enough to keep you down unless you let it Nothing you can buy or sell that's good as what He freely gives Nobody knows where and how much it hurts Better than the One who's been there Nobody's been there more than the Lord And when all those aches say to quit The answer's look up ahead And you can't go back now There's nothing to go back for Is growth worth the growing pains (I can't go back, too much on the line) But now that you're running Look at the strength you've gained (Look at the junk I've been able to leave behind) None was worth it's weight It tied me down too long I've thrown it off I won't take it back on It back on (Cause I'm doing it one better) Leave behind the hate (I'm going one up) Hate did you no good (I'm gonna leave behind the devil) Wasn't worth it's weight (I'm going to hang on to His love) Nothing in this world shines brighter than the hope of heaven No love that can touch you deeply as His Nothing big enough to keep you down unless you let it Nothing you can buy or sell that's good as what He freely gives Nothing in this world shines brighter than the hope of heaven No

Him Rich Mullins Ephesians 2, John 3:1-21 Oh, and you better run 'cause His love is catching you And you're scared that when it does its gonna break through You build your house of dreams behind a wall That no one could penetrate And you leave yourself no escape No chance to be made new Oh, and you better stand with your fist clenched to the sky 'Cause open handed you're afraid of what you may find You've got it all or so you want to think But anyway you'd much rather pretend It's too much to run the risk When you can simply close your eyes And you can live without Him You can live without Him if you want You can turn your back on music Turn your back on love Tuck your tail and run 'Cause you're good at looking down, never seeing a thing You're good at being touched and never feeling You're good at sitting in the midst of a music that's never heard But you're not as good at living as you thought you were But you can live (You can live without Him) If that's what living is (You can live without Him) Death would be such a gift Oh Lord, let me die that I might find my life in You You can live without Him You can live without Him if you want But that is so much less Than any life that I could ever choose Oh, and you better fill the empty spaces with some noise 'Cause if you look too squarely at the facts You might have to make a choice You'd better put off 'til tomorrow Maybe then you'll be more in control Somehow tonight this feeling Stole into you and left you soiled Oh, and you throw it off before you see beyond the day There may very well be more But not right now, don't let it in And if you don't let it root You'll never have to let it make you grow It's more life than you want to know So shut it down again And you can live without Him (You can live without Him) You can live without Him if you want You can turn your back on music Turn your back on love Tuck your tail and run 'Cause you're good at looking down, never seeing a thing You're good at being touched and never feeling You're good at sitting in the midst of a music that's never heard But you're not as good at living as you thought you were But you can live (You can live without Him) If

rich It can set a prisoner free I know He can do it for you God knows He did it for me And I can see love And love is all I want to show you Love Love's the only way to go And love But love is all a

And see Him walking along the shore His friends and disciples are gathering around Him Never spake a man like this before But why is a man as wise as He Weeping alone in Gethsemane Could it be because He's afraid we'd never see The heaven in His eyes See the Master walking on the water And hear Him speak and calm an angry wave Look at Him raising of Jairus's daughter And with a word Lazarus comes forth from the grave And why is a man is strong as this Being betrayed by a good friend's kiss Could it be because this man missed The heaven in His eyes And I'm not talking about your pie in the sky That you good \nboys and girls get in the by and by But rather the strength that we could find If you've got the guts to try See the Teacher playing with the children And see Him baffle the doctors of the law Look at the people gathering to go with Him Those who see the vision that He saw And this is why a man as holy as He Had to die alone on Calvary Cause it was the only way we could ever see The

are&quot; and we both screamed and laughed ... bill was not a fraud because he did do as I said many would imagine ...nor was he a pussy or a coward ..he was a gentle man brought up by good parents who could not stand to think that someone felt he was a liar or dealing falsely with them and so he just bought another cartridge and moved on ... just as he never made a stink about his some of his material ending up in denis leary's &quot;little skitshow&quot; ... many would have sued and made a &quot;name&quot; and a stink and found a way to &quot;promote&quot; themselves ... he just joked privately that leary had been invited to bill's parents' house for thanksgiving instead of bill this year&quot; and moved on ... and since i brought up that word &quot;sacred&quot; ... so much about bill has that word attached to it ...not just that my memory of him is sacred in my life but the way he treated people and the truth ... he was the kindest most compassionate loyal soul i have ever known ... were he a woman i would have married him in a heartbeat but i was not robbed of anything because he was born a man ...i simply knew him on another level which one should hopefully know their spouse and partner on ... as friend and best friend and that was more than enough (and no i am not gay though i am sure if i were i would find men as big a mystery and a necessary nuisance as i do women ... i just do not have the time nor the emotional patience to be bi ) ... my god ... bill was and is bigger than life and he is certainly bigger than death and that is why this day does not toll heavily in my heart ... it simply reminds me how long it has been since i have gotten to talk with bill on the phone or play nintendo together or laugh over dinner ... but even at the loss of these daily events in the present ... at this moment i am smiling and so happy ... because in knowing bill i had a friend who was so loyal that if some woman hurt me he would say &quot;she is cut from the team&quot; and trust me were there a reconciliation it was very hard to get them back in bill's good favor because he took the hearts and feelings of his friends so personally and treated them so protectively ... and in my years of touring and doing one nighters with comics from all over and watching married comics &quot;slip off the ring&quot; bill had the ability or rather the absolute single minded compulsion to be loyal if he were involved no matter how he was being treated on the other end ... any woman who was lucky enough to know him that way knew the soul of a poet and had a devoted friend ... jesus i am reading all this i wrote here and i may very well throw up ... this sounds like a goddamned hallmark card and like i am eulogizing some eagle scout and somehow &quot;dressing up his memory&quot; in death .... that is not the case ... bill was and is that good ... when i spoke at his memorial service i looked out at devoted friends and family and friends and remarked ... &quot;seeing this adoration for him reminds me of how religions get started&quot; ... when i was going through my separation and divorce i did not mind it at all because bill was there every step of the way ...not guiding and counseling but instead coming up with impromptu tirades and little plays involving my ex wife and her current love and their potential offspring which bill would translate into hours of the most hysterical healing laughter as he would do this little show nightly on the phone with me called &quot;i love Lucifer&quot; \nwhich he would begin with the theme song to &quot;i love Lucy&quot; followed by the sound of a doorbell &quot;ding dong&quot; then each episode would be about some unsuspecting guest entering the home of my ex and her lover and their offspring ...the parents would be out and the &quot;dark one&quot; was always for some unknown reason locked in a room pleading so sweetly and gently for someone to let &quot;it&quot; out (reminding me of an old twiglight zone with the devil locked in the basement) and each episode would end with this guest (from the paperboy to the landlord to a grandparent) unlocking that door to release this poor child followed by shrieks of &quot;oh sweet jesus&quot; and growls ...chomping ... screams ... and silence ... closing it out with the theme song again .... he had a very cinematic narrative style ... these were truly some of the funniest things i have ever heard but more importantly they were the best medicine for a heart that badly needed healing and he gave that so willingly and freely hours on end ... and in the days before online we would talk on the phone while powering up our Nintendos in synch and furiously playing Zelda and others at the same time as we swore at the makers of the software ... when i fell &quot;in love&quot; once ... bill went into his bathroom (still living in new york then) and used an 8 track (not that kind) tape recorder he bought from will lee (letterman's band's bassist) and because the acoustics were nice in there he would record music on his guitar and sing along ... after hours of recording and mixing he sent a tape for the girl i fell for so she could listen to it while i was out of town and think of me and my love ... it was the most beautiful romantic sweet heartfelt music ... which has found it's way instrumentally onto his newer CDs thanks to kevin booth ... he did these things because he wanted his friends to know how much he loved and regarded them ... we would repeat lines from butch cassidy and one really applies to bill (or willie as he wanted to be called but i just couldn't because it sounded so gay ...please no mail regarding this) the line is &quot;i've got vision and the rest of the world wears bifocals&quot; and when bill got too full of himself i would say &quot;you just keep thinking there butch ...that's what you are good at&quot; and he would laugh at himself immediately ... he was always the first to do that ... and when i broke up with that girl...besides applying the same brutally right on the money perceptions and humor he had used in the routines that got me through my divorce he also happened to at least call 6 or 8 times a day to make absolutely sure i was &quot;ok&quot;....sorry folks ...he was just simply a nice guy ... his mother will tell you the same and people will just think &quot;well that is just the blindness of parental love&quot; ... nope ... he was just that nice and she got it as to who bill was and delighted in her boy and rightly so ... and for all of those who delight in your belief he hated children ...sorry ... he doted on his nephew and niece (steve's kids who is also a great guy ...this family is ridiculously great including mr and mrs hicks who i cannot bring myself to call jim and mary because of my upbringing) he would give the children the most wonderful gifts like books he had read as a child and other things that showed both love and proved he was simply a terrific uncle who wanted them to be happy and imaginative he would have been such a great dad ... as with sam kinison who i introduced my wife to after a show once and sam and i hugged and he turned to my wife and genuinely meant it when he said &quot;i hope it was not too vulgar&quot; ... and for those who delighted in bill's observations and assumed he was so on the money in his perceptions that he would not hesitate to be cruel ... well ... judge for yourselves ... i remember when carrot top called bill and asked why he hated him ...now for those of you waiting for a really &quot;acerbic put them in their place&quot; punchline ... there was none ...instead bill explained his disdain for certain approaches to comedy and in what was so typically bill they met and ended up taking pictures ...one of carrot top showing bill a prop and one of bill showing carrot top a notebook and a pen ... both men showed great humor and a lot of class that day as far as i am concerned ... and that is what bill was all about ultimately ...healing ...not tearing something or someone down but building them up and making it all better than it was before he had come into contact with them ... another story ... and this is so obscure and strangely beautiful and touching i hope the point is not lost it was such a small and gentle act ... the bible speaks of letting your gifts be in secret so as to not be glorifying oneself in the eyes of others ... we have a mutual friend who had a brother with schizophrenia and was ( i hear he has passed away ...sorry i did not say i am sorry ...you know who you are ...your brother was a treat and thanks for introducing us...sorry i had to say that to someone who i know will be reading this) a really delightful individual ... well when bill and i were in england he bought a box of very expensive cigars (i noticed this ..he would \nnot make that point ever) and brought them back to the states as a gift for this man i just spoke of ... well ... i understand instead of lighting up and puffing away this man furiously unrolled one of these cigars over the toilet and emptied it out into the stool and flushed it in glee and bill ... instead of being horrified at how his expensive gift was being misused he was totally delighted that his gift was being enjoyed so immensely and was supremely happy about it...that is how generous bill was ... so .... even though i SAY i do not miss him i do miss not having any new stories ... the night after his memorial i had to do a gig and after getting through it i went back to the room and out of habit looked at the phone to see if the message light was flashing as it always had been every night for years before and whenever i would call the desk there would be a message &quot;bill called&quot; or &quot;butch called&quot; or &quot;call buddy love&quot; ... i remember onetime when i was working is such a small town the motel closed their switchboard after 11 ..well this would not do for bill..that is when we about the time nightly we began to talk and enjoy the fullness of an evening so when the desk said &quot;we cannot put you through it is after 11&quot; he said &quot;huh?",0.5962070822715759],["Some types of bacteria on food can make you sick, so it is important to know what to do.",0.5958096981048584],["Mutualist bacteria and fungi can be

running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world \nbesides there something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a

like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simply I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looked with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them

who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me
