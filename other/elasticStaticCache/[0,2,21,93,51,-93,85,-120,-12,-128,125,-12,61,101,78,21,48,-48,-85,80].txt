that one can take to speed up or slow down change Identify and describe several ways in which things may change Identify and describe how change can be prevented or enhanced Distinguish between important and unimportant changes in given situations Science as Inquiry (CS 1) Students will be able to: Solve problems using a variety of strategies Pose questions \nfor scientific investigations and make predictions about the outcomes Use appropriate tools and techniques to gather, organize, and interpret data Construct explanations, including the development of simple models, for observations made Discuss the relationship between evidence and explanations Communicate scientific procedure and explanations Make hypotheses and design simple experiments to test hypotheses made Recognize the variables in a situation and the importance of controlling them when conducting a scientific investigation Science, Technology, and Society (CS 2) Students will be able to: Use an assortment of measuring instruments with a variety of scales, such as rulers, thermometers, graduated cylinders, balances, and timers Describe and practice appropriate techniques for using simple measuring devices Use technology to explore events in nature (e.g. telescopes, microscopes, computer probes, etc.) Explore nature with simple scientific tool (e.g. magnifying glasses, batteries and bulbs) Use technology to capture information on film, tape, etc. Share ideas, data, or summaries of investigations with children (at other schools) by electronic communication Prepare various types of tables and graphs as a means for summarizing and analyzing data which they have collected Use calculators to perform mathematical calculations with data which has been collected and recorded Record data using appropriate units Use a calculator to determine other important quantitative values from data, using proper units (e.g. speed, density, area, volume) Compile and display classroom data on a computer Use technology to share data with other classmates or groups of students Describe ways that machines are used to manufacture items faster and in greater quantity than one person can do alone Construct simple projects from readily available materials found at home Choose appropriate common materials for mechanical construction of simple models Write and illustrate a story that describes where, for their home, the water comes from and the sewage goes Describe what would occur if the power in their home was disconnected during a snowstorm, and what behavior changes would be necessary Explore ways they may participate in recycling, conserving energy, or conserving water Interview parents and grandparents to find out about technologies and products that have disappeared or appeared during their lifetimes Describe and defend decisions that they have made involving themselves and their environment Identify and gather information needed to make a science and/or technology-related decision Describe the possible consequences of various alternative decisions to a science and/or technology-related decision Demonstrate that knowledge makes it possible to make informed decisions Cite examples which show how society can affect the direction taken by science and technology Describe how science and technology affect career choices and the kinds of work people do Unifying Themes and Concepts (CS 6) Students will be able to: Explore and identify the parts and materials that comprise simple objects and how they are connected (e.g. disassemble common household objects) Predict the effect of removing or exchanging parts of an object (e.g. a mechanical toy, a jigsaw puzzle) Discuss how parts when put together can do things that they could not do by themselves Assemble a commercial product using manufacturer's instructions (e.g. Legos, plastic models) Take apart and reassemble simple machines or household appliances Design and build a simple device with a desired function from accessible materials Describe or demonstrate how something may not work well if a part is missing, broken, worn out, mismatched, or misconnected Explain, using charts, pictures, and models, an important earth, physical, or life science system (e.g. solar system, home heating system, ecosystem) Suggest several possible uses for a simple object (e.g. a washer on a string, a balance beam) Identify and describe the essential parts of any object or system Relate structure and function of parts of any object in a system to the system as a whole Discuss the interrelationship among the parts of an object or system Observe the movement of people or objects (e.g. traffic on a one-way street) List several things that change through time or because of a change in the environment Recognize that some changes are so slow that they are hard to observe (e.g. display monthly photographs of the class;",0.7876076102256775],["Objectives Create a standing wave in an air column Observe
