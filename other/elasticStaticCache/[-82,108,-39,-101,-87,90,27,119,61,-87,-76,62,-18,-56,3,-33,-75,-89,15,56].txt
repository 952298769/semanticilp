[["Transit: The transit time of a celestial body refers to the instant that its center crosses an imaginary line in the sky - the observer's meridian - running from north to south. For observers in low to middle latitudes, transit is approximately midway between rise and set, and represents the time at which the body is highest in the sky on any given day. At high latitudes, neither of these statements may be true - for example, there may be several transits between rise and set. The transit of the Sun is local solar (sundial) noon. The difference between the transit times of the Sun and Moon is closely related to the Moon's phase. The New Moon transits at about the same time as the Sun; the First Quarter Moon transits about 6 hours after the Sun; the Full Moon transits about 12 hours after/before the Sun; and the Last Quarter Moon transits about 6 hours before the Sun.",1.5469645261764526],["It is 6 a.m. when the moon is at its highest point in the sky looking south.",1.2121039628982544],["The Solstice occurs twice a year approximately 6 months apart, when the Sun hits its highest &amp; lowest points in our sky.",1.1773521900177002],["When is the Sun at it's highest point in the sky?",1.1167197227478027],["When is the Sun at it's highest point in the sky?",1.1167197227478027],["Astronomical noon is defined to be the time of day when the Sun is highest in the sky.",1.0629322528839111],["I took the melatonin when I awoke in New York (6 a.m.) the day before and day of departure and then at 6 p.m. the first day in Thailand (which was 6 a.m. in New York).",1.008453130722046],["6 Approximately 36,000 according to the New York Times.",0.9656182527542114],["Information on the highest taxpayers in the United States in 1925 was reported in the New York Times, September 6, 1925.",0.9097341895103455],["Information on the highest taxpayers in the United States in 1925 was reported in the New York Times, September 6, 1925.",0.9097341895103455],["If three good reasons are enough, this may be the day for you to check the sky at 6 a.m., about an hour ahead of the sun.",0.8859177231788635],["The approximate time for departure in 6 A.M.",0.8822255730628967],["Other pointers: Biologically, the highest-risk time of the day for drowsiness is between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.",0.8553816080093384]]
