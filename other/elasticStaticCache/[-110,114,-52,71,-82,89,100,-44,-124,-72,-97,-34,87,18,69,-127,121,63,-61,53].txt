[["In general, when matter changes structure energy will also be involved The combustion of methane releases energy The conversion of liquid water into steam (gaseous water) consumes energy The study of energy conversion is thermodynamics (&quot;flow of energy&quot;) Two important laws of thermodynamics Energy cannot be created or destroyed Energy always goes from a more useful form to a less useful form Conservation of Energy First Law of Thermodynamics Energy may be converted from one form to another without loss (energy is conserved) Energy may occur in many forms chemical radiant mechanical nuclear electrical Its utility depends on the form For example gasoline is a form or chemical energy combustion of gasoline converts the chemical energy to heat energy an engine can utilize the heat energy, converting it to mechanical energy Bond formation releases energy the combustion of the gasoline changes the chemical structure, forming more amd/or different bonds the energy of the process is released as heat The second law of thermodynamics states that energy always goes from a more useful form to a less useful form Engines cannot operate at 100% efficiency While energy is conserved, some is always lost to a less useful form (friction that in turn produces heat is a good example) the degradation or unavailability of energy is defined by a concept called entropy Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder (less usefulness of the energy) in a system in isolated systems entropy is always increasing heat always flows from hot to cold ice melts because heat flows into it from the surroundings ice has a highly ordered structure that becomes more random as it is converted into liquid water (entropy has increased) entropy CAN be overcome, but only by the addition of energy to the system in order to freeze liquid water into ice, resulting in an ordered structure, energy is needed (electrical energy is converted to thermal energy in the freezer, and finally stored in the ice) entropy increases because there are many more disordered forms than ordered forms (there's only one correct solution for a jigsaw puzzle, but lots of ways to randomly mix the pieces) Energy is measured in units called calories (the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1g of water 1 degree centigrade) 1kcal=1000 calories=4.184 kjoules Mechanical energy may be potential kinetic An object has potential energy if it is in a position from which it could move and do work potential energy is expressed as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving body and is expressed as Heat Energy Heat energy is involved when states of matter are changed gas to liquid=condensation liquid to gas=evaporation solid to gas=sublimation solid to liquid=fusion These are physical changes NOT chemical.",2.8149890899658203],["The only thing that's needed in a phase change is to add energy (to go from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas) or to remove energy (to make the opposite changes).

Water is one of the few that can become a liquid, solid, and gas. For example, if you were to put an ice cube, a solid, outside on a hot day, it would turn to water, a liquid. If you were to boil that water, it would turn into steam, which is a gas. Then, during condensation, the gas is turned into a liquid. Freezing a liquid to a solid can be more rapid if the water is hot than when it is warm because of the rapid evaporation. Sublimation is where heat enters a solid to change the molecule bonding, turning the solid into a gas. All of these substances have the same composition, they just have a different form. Phase change depends on the temperature and the amount of pressure exerted on it, also usually involving a transfer of energy. Physical change and chemical change are the two different types of phase changes. Chemical change is when the composition of a substance changes. An example of chemical change is when a leaf changes color in the fall. A physical change is when only the form of the substance changes. A cloud is made through phase change by warm air rising and expanding. It then cools while expanding and water vapor molecules collide together and stick",2.0780649185180664],["The primary chemical waste forms of tritium from DOE activities are tritium gas and tritiated water, either as a liquid or vapor.",2.028285503387451],["The primary chemical waste forms of tritium from DOE activities are tritium gas and tritiated water, either as a liquid or vapor.",2.028285503387451],["Air Stripping -bubbles air through contaminated water and the chemical(s) changes from a liquid into a gas.",2.0131304264068604],["Air Stripping -bubbles air through contaminated water and the chemical(s) changes from a liquid into a gas.",2.0131304264068604],["A change in form (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) but not in chemical composition.",1.950034737586975],["A change in form (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) but not in chemical composition.",1.950034737586975],["When muscles need to get energy from glucose they do this by changing the glucose into other chemicals such as water and carbon dioxide which releases the energy.",1.917633295059204],["Physical changes such as the change from a solid to a liquid to a gas and chemical reactions will be compared.",1.9100488424301147],["Physical changes such as the change from a solid to a liquid to a gas and chemical reactions will be compared.",1.9100488424301147]]
