knowledge, taking into account technical and economic considerations...\" International Convention For The Prevention Of Pollution From Ships (1973): \"Desiring to achieve the complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances...\" Recommended Text for Article A The Parties, Recognizing that persistent organic pollutants are transported across international boundaries and are deposited around the world, often far from their places of origin, and that national and regional actions alone are not sufficient to protect human health and the environment, Aware that persistent organic pollutants resist degradation under natural conditions and can biomagnify in upper trophic levels to concentrations which may affect the health of exposed wildlife and humans, Concerned that persistent organic pollutants have been associated with adverse effects on human health, impacting growth and development, immune function, neurological function, reproduction, and inducing mutations and cancers, Emphasizing that these effects may be seen at extraordinarily low levels of exposure, and that young children and developing fetuses are most at risk, Acknowledging that the Arctic region and especially its indigenous peoples, who subsist on Arctic fish and mammals, are particularly at risk because of the transport of POPs from other regions, their accumulation at northern latitudes and biomagnification in northern food chains, Resolved to take measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize releases of persistent organic pollutants, taking into account the application of the precautionary approach, as set forth in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, Considering that the predominant sources of environmental releases of persistent organic pollutants are the use of certain pesticides, the manufacture and use of certain chemicals, and the unintentional formation of certain substances in waste incineration, combustion, metal production and mobile sources, Recognizing that sufficient evident of environmental damage and human toxicity \nexists to warrant the phaseout of certain POPs beginning immediately, Noting that evidence is emerging regarding the potential adverse health and environmental effects of additional POPs, Acknowledging that billions of tons of man-made chemicals have been manufactured and released to the global environment, and that hundreds of new chemicals are synthesized each year, most inadequately studied for their effects on the environment and health, Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on existing levels and continuing releases of persistent organic pollutants and their effects on human health and the environment, and acknowledging the need to continue scientific and technical cooperation to further the understanding of these issues, Noting the important contribution of the private and non-governmental sectors to knowledge of the effects associated with persistent organic pollutants, available alternatives and prevention techniques, and their role in assisting in the elimination of persistent organic pollutants, Recognizing that there are subregional, regional and global regimes in place to control persistent organic pollutants, such as the POPs Protocol of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, as well as other international instruments governing the management of hazardous wastes, their transboundary movement and disposal, in particular the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, Noting the need for global action to eliminate on persistent organic pollutants,
