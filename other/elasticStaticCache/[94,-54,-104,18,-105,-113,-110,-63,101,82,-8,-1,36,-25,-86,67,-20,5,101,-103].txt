surface across which gas exchange by diffusion can occur between blood and either water or air The surface must be moist enough to allow the cells to live large enough to permit sufficient gas exchange thin enough to permit rapid diffusion In respiration blood entering the respiratory organ must be high in CO 2 and low in O 2 both gases must move into and out of the body tissues through diffusion requires a functional connection between the respiratory and circulatory system the external air/water medium must be frequently replenished The primary respiratory organs of vertebrates are gills and lungs, although the skin is sometimes used External cutaneous respiration is the ancestral form of respiration found in most protochordates During external respiration gas exchange occurs at the level of the skin and oxygen and carbon dioxide are passed into and out of tissues the process still occurs in small vertebrates as long as they have low activity levels and live in cool flowing water or in damp air - frogs meet about \nhalf of their needs for gas exchange through their skin Because most vertebrates are too large for each cell to interact directly with the environment, many organisms have evolved specialized organ systems to undertake the process of diffusion Generally, fishes use gills and tetrapods use lungs, although the distinction is not absolute Through ventilation of the organs of the respiratory system, gaseous exchange can occur Ventilation of respiratory structures depends on ram ventilation - forward momentum contributes to flow of water across the gill membranes dual pump - buccal and opercular action operating in tandem drives water in a nearly continuous unidirectional flow across the gill curtain between them - the suction phase begins with compressed buccal and opercular cavities and closed valves - as the buccal cavity expands, the internal oral valves open and water moves into the buccal cavity and across the gill curtain - during the force phase , the oral valve closes and water is forced out through the opercular valve pulse pump - the dual pump is modified into an inhalation/exhalation phase - the exhalation phase begins with transfer of spent air from the lungs into the buccal cavity - the exhalation phase concludes with expulsion of air from the buccal cavity to the outside either through the mouth or under the operculum - the inhalation phase begins with the organism taking fresh air into the mouth - the inhalation phase concludes with transfer of air from the buccal cavity into the lungs aspiration pump - air is sucked in, or aspirated, by low pressure created around the lungs - the lungs are located within the pump so that the force required to ventilate them is applied directly - a moveable diaphragm and rib cage cause pressure changes rather than the action of the buccal cavity Internal gills develop from the pharynx as evaginations called pharyngeal pouches visceral grooves opposite to the pharyngeal pouches are separated from the pharyngeal pouches by a thin layer of tissue called the closing plate - the closing plates rupture in the embryo to establish the communication between the gill chamber and the surrounding medium - tetrapods retain the first closing plate, which becomes the eardrum (tympanic membrane), while the remaining ones disappear the pouches are also separated by the visceral arches, which combine to form the parabranchial gill chambers the first visceral arch becomes the spiracle The general structure of a mature gill is composed of several parts: gill rakers are cartilagenous or bony parts on the pharyngeal margin of the gill and function in preventing food particles from entering the gill chambers gill rays are found within the interbranchial septa and provide support for the gill gill filaments are the feather-like projections of the gills across which diffusion of gases occurs gill filaments also possess gill lamellae, which are small crevices through which water passes for diffusion - lamellae are oriented parallel to the stream of water through the gills to maximize efficiency of diffusion - the blood flow through the gills opposes the flow of water through the lamellae (countercurrent flow) and maximizes the efficiency of diffusion - this is important because water has about 1/30th the oxygen concentration of air Three primary types of gill morphology are found in fishes: Holobranch - gill bar with anterior and posterior rows of gill filaments (jawed fishes) Hemibranch - gill bar with gill filaments found on either the posterior or anterior side (sharks) Pseudobranch - gill bar with posterior filaments modified to serve a nonrespiratory function such as sensory or salt balance - spiracular pseudobranch in rays and skates with much reduced hemibranch providing unobstructed flow of water for gill irrigation Gills can also be used in excretion of nitrogenous wastes (in the form of ammonia) and regulation of salts in the body There are three general variations in gills found in fishes: Pouched gills - Agnatha - have external and internal pores rather than gill slits - water is drawn into the gill chambers through the mouth and then passed over the gills Septal gills - Elasmobranchs - have gill slits rather than pores and gill septa that help support gill filaments - inspiration occurs through the mouth and expiration occurs through the gills - the exception is when the shark is feeding, when water moves into the pharynx through the spiracle Opercular gills - bony fishes - have no septa (aseptal) but gill bars anchor gill filaments - the operculum protects the filaments and expiration occurs through a single gill slit External gills develop from the skin ectoderm of the branchial area but are not directly related to the visceral skeleton or branchial chambers are found most often in larval or paedomorphic amphibians Swim bladders and the origin of lungs Lungs are found among fishes found in warm or stagnant water, as well as in primitive fishes, and allow for the fish to gulp air and undergo diffusion in an environment with relatively low dissolved oxygen Such fishes undergo long periods of breath-holding ( apnea ) alternated with short periods of lung ventilation Swim bladders Swim bladders are similar to lungs, but are found in fishes that live in more oxygen-rich environments - thus, the air-filled spaces serve less of a purpose in respiration and function more as a hydrostatic organ are connected to the pharynx by the pneumatic duct make up approximately 4 - 11% of the body by volume counters the increased density and sinking tendency from an ossified skeleton gas is secreted into the swim bladder from blood by action of the gas glands or may be connected directly to the digestive tract via the pneumatic duct in primitive teleosts air is added to the swim bladder to maintain its volume as fish dive and removed as the fish surfaces gas glands may be associated with a countercurrent rete mirabile, which affects partial pressure and flow of oxygen into and out of the bladder Lungs and their ducts Tetrapod lungs are paired organs surrounded by pleura and contained in the pleural cavity they have a higher surface to area volume ratio than the gills are joined to the ventral side of the gut tube by the trachea \nin general, any increase in overall body size leads to an increased amount of compartmentalization of the lungs During respiration air enters through the mouth, or into the external nares to the choanae, and then passes into the pharynx from there, air travels through the glottis to the trachea, and in the trachea splits into bronchi the bronchi then lead to the lungs, which are themselves highly lobed branching continues from the bronchi into bronchioles, then alveolar sacs, and end in alveoli - small sac-like structure within the lung where gas exchange occurs As in gills, the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide is facilitated by counter-current flow in the alveoli the lining of the lungs is lubricated by surfactant, a tension depressant surfactants are generally lipoproteins and reduce the resistance to lung expansion as well as the energy needed to fill the lungs In the evolution of lungs from amphibians to mammals, several modifications to the respiratory structures are primarily associated with ventilation of the lungs In amphibians, ventilation of the lungs occurs through external nares and choanae rather than the mouth - air is drawn into the pharynx by muscle contraction that lowers the pharynx floor In reptiles, muscle action against the ribs helps to change internal air pressure, causing inspiration - the action is assisted by contraction of the diaphragmatic muscle, which is not the same thing as the diaphragm In birds, the lungs are half the size of the lungs of a similarly-sized mammal - however, the lungs connect to a system of air sacs in the bones and abdominal cavity, which increases the capacity to 2 - 3 times that of a similarly-sized mammal - the result is to decrease overall body mass, but still maintain respiratory efficiency - conducting passages continue to subdivide into parabronchi, with one-way airflow through the lungs The primary mammal modification is the formation of the diaphragm dividing the thoracic and abdominal cavity - movement of air into the lungs is facilitated by contraction of the diaphragm to change the pressure in the chest cavity.",1.3510205745697021],["calcium carbonate (limestone) Uplifting of sediments Exposure by erosion Alternatively,

SMITH (1769-1839), in the course of working on canal excavations all over England, noticed that the same series of fossil assemblages could be found again and again-he was eventually able to predict both the order of fossil assemblages and the thickness of a given stratum at any locality before a hole was even dug-he could do this because he realized that the slabs of sedimentary rock were draped over he each other like a stack of really thick blankets on a badly made bed-each layer had a characteristic group of fossils in it that were found where ever that layer of rock was found-Smith had been in charge of digging a lot of holes and had traced each stratum laterally over great distances Smith, like most engineers, was not a philosopher and drew no grand conclusions from his work-it was simply a practical tool to use in canal and mine construction-he didn't care whether the fossils represented organic remains or were simply \"sports of nature\"-he had no interest in whether or not he was documenting the evolution of the earth, but other people looked at his work and realized that he was Smith invented STRATIGRAPHY without realizing its implications-we will get to this topic later in the semester-for now it is important to realized that Smith used FOSSILS to create an ORDINAL SYSTEM for organizing rocks-an ordinal system is one that imposes order by describing a unique series of events-anywhere you find any part of that unique series of events, you have found a part of that system-in this case the system was describing the series of events that is the history of the earth-the events are recognized by the groups of fossils that define them on a much shorter timescale think of the artifacts that characterize the post-war decades in US history-if you see black&amp;white TVs, cars with big tail fins, women wearing bobby sox and men wearing pompadours, you know you are within about 5 years of 1957-if you see lava lamps, leather jackets with long fringes, and eight track tapes, you know you are within 5 year of 1967-and so on-paleontologists do the same thing with fossils, except they have look at rocks and sediments instead of archive footage in libraries and boxes in attics this means that to understand the evolution of the earth, it would help if you could recognize some fossils-in order to keep all the fossils straight, it will help if you know how biota are classified EARLIEST FOSSIL EVIDENCE it is possible, in theory, that whole other kingdoms of biota existed, but we have found no fossil evidence as yet earliest fossils are of prokaryotic organisms in rocks ~3.5 billion years old-this is approximately a billion years after the earth \nis thought to have formed and is in the early part of what is called the ARCHEAN EON the cells of prokaryotes lack nuclei and the DNA is not arranged in chromosomes-modern representatives include the misnamed \"blue-green algae\" or CYANOBACTERIA-cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and produced much of the free oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for subsequent life forms-modern cyanobacteria look very similar to their fossilized ancestors preserved in rocks that are billions of years old cyanobacteria accumulate in mats in shallow saline waters and biomineralize calcite-the layer of bacteria smothers and a new layer forms over it, along with a new layer of calcite-the resulting structure is called a STROMATOLITE-they have been found in Archean rocks and they still grow today in a few isolated locations in western Australia, Belize, and the Bahamas LIFE GETS MORE COMPLICATED the first eukaryotes, cells with nuclei and chromosomes, appear in the fossil record at 1.4 billion years before present-this part of the geological time scale is called the PROTEROZOIC EON-there is good evidence that eukaryotes arose from symbiotic combinations of prokaryotic organisms-the presence of mitochondrial DNA distinct from cellular DNA was one of the earlier pieces of evidence toward this theory, which has been championed by Lynn Margulis since the 1970s-modern examples of single-celled eukaryotes include yeasts, many types of algae, protozoans like Amoeba and Paramecium and marine microplankton the oldest known eukaryotes are green algae-these fossils are found in rocks that may be as old as 2.0 Ba and are definitely at least 1.8 Ba-fossil prokaryotes are told from fossil eukaryotes based mostly on size-modern prokaryotes are rarely as large as 60 microns, while modern eukaryotes are typically more than 200 microns long-eurkaryotic organisms require AEROBIC conditions (free oxygen is present) to survive-these fossils tell us that earth's atmosphere had become aerobic by 2.0 Ba-by 1.25 Ba the first multicellular algae (seaweeds) had appeared in the fossil record the Bitter Springs Formation in central Australia was deposited 0.8-0.75 Ba-fossils of green algae occur in TETRADS in these rocks, which is consistent with MEIOTIC CELL DIVISION typical of eukaryotes and unknown in prokaryotes LIFE GETS MULTICELLULAR late Proterozoic trace fossils of burrows suggest the presence of primitive worms from nearly 700 Ma-the shapes of the burrows suggest that the organisms that made them were more rigid than a single-celled motile organism could be-even multicellular organisms without skeletons of any kind can make their bodies more rigid than the cell membrane of a single-celled organism EDIACARAN (or VENDIAN) FAUNA-in Ediacara Hills of Flinders Range in western Australia-670 Ma-soft-parts of about 30 different large multi-cellular animals are preserved as MOLDS-mixture of recognizable forms, like worms, and body plans that do not resemble any subsequent life forms-few of the Ediacaran fauna belong to familiar phyla-some workers believe that they may not be the ancestors of later metazoans, but an entire kingdom that did not survive the Proterozoic-however, the Ediacaran fauna does include undisputed Cnidaria, which do have modern relative, but are not ancestral to most metazoans For more on this topic see Ediacaran fauna a significant aspect of the Ediacaran fauna is that it made up of HETEROTROPHS-organisms that eat other organisms or detris for nutrition-all previous life forms had been AUTOTROPHIC and produced their own food through either photosynthesis or chemosythesis MULTICELLULARITY CATCHES ON by the end of the Proterozoic three of the five surviving kingdoms had evolved-the Monera, the Protoctista and the Animalia-the Cnidaria of the Ediacararan fauna are the first acoelomates-the first coelomates occur in the last 35 m.y. of the Proterozoic, an interval called the TOMMOTIAN-these animals are referred to as the SMALL SCALY FAUNA (or Tommotian fauna)-they are typically less than 2 mm and the 'shells' are composed of CALCIUM PHOSPHATE-few of these 'shells' appear to cover complete animals, but instead are pieces of more extensive armoring CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION in the lower Cambrian there a geologically sudden increase in the diversity of life preserved to the fossil record-representatives of two different kingdoms-the Protoctista and the Animalia-independently developed BIOMINERALIZATION-the manufacture of minerals by living organisms-while the organisms were alive, these biomineralized skeletons probably provided protection from predation and from the physical elements-after the organism died it provides geologists with a record of the organism's existence-the shells of many biota that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion were made of calcium phoshate-apparently the environment was very rich in phosphate at the time-later the most common biominerals became CALCIUM CARBONATE and SILICA SAMPLE PRODUCTS OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION kingdom PROTOCTISTA phylum SARCOMASTIGOPHORA foraminifera radiolaria kingdom ANIMALIA phylum PORIFERA sponges phylum ARCHEOCYATHA (Cambrian only) phylum ARTHROPODA (e.g., trilobites) phylum MOLLUSCA (e.g., clams, snails, nautiloids) phylum ECHINODERMATA (e.g., starfish, urchins, crinoids) the emergence of large 'shelly' metazoans and protists with mineral shells vastly increased the volume of the fossil record-exoskeletons were either AGGLUTINATED (pieces of sediment glued together) or SECRETED (biomineralized) trilobites appeared ~527 Ma and typically comprised more than 90% of the shelly fauna of the Cambrian period-inarticulate brachiopods comprised 5-7% and the other phyla make up the remainder-despite the dominance of the trilobites nearly all the other existing phyla (including the chordates) first appeared during the 30 m.y. that make up the Cambrian period THE BURGESS SHALE in addition to phyla that still exist, several phyla developed during the Cambrian (or the Proterozoic and existed until the Cambrian), but did not survive into the Ordovician period-we know this because of the discovery of LAGERSTATTEN in a few locations around the world-these deposits preserve fossilized remains of both the shelly hard-parts and outlines of the organic \nsoft parts of a fauna the Burgess Shale is located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia and is a middle Cambrian rock formation-when it was first discovered in the early 20th century by Charles Doolittle Walcott the fauna were shoe-horned into existing phyla because at the time paleontologists could not conceive of entire extinct phyla-in the 1960s and 70s the fossils were re-examined-the fossils that were entirely soft-bodied organisms were reassigned to newly erected phyla-the 'Burgess Shale fauna' has since been found in other middle Cambrian lagerstatten around the world, but not in any younger lagerstatten a large majority (98",1.0476402044296265],["Wh en water does not cover much of the streambed, the living area for aquatic

oxygen throughout the body reflex: automatic reaction to a stimulus regeneration: ability of an organism to regrow lost parts relative dating: method of determining the age of fossils that involves comparing the rock layers in which the fossils were formed renewable resource : natural resource that is replaced by nature replication (rehp-luh-KAY-shuhn): process in which DNA molecules form exact duplicates reproduction: process by which living things give rise to the same type of living thing reproductive system: body system in which the male and female sex cells are produced and which enables an organism to produce offspring respiration : process by which living organisms take in oxygen and use it to produce energy respiratory system: body system that gets oxygen into the body and removes carbon dioxide and water from the body response: some action or movement of an organism brought on by a stimlilus retina (REHT-uhn-uh): inner eye layer on which an image is focused rhizoid (RIGH-zoid): rootlike structure through which mosses absorb water rhizome (RlGH-zohm): underground stem of a fern ribosome: grainlike body made up of RNA and attached to the inner surface of an
