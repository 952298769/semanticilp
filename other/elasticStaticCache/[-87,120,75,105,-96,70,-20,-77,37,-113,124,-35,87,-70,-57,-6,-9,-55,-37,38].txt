[["To meet the standard, the learner: 3 estimates measurements is measuring with standard units (US and metric) is beginning to realize that all measurement is approximate uses balance scale to measure mass accurately explores area and perimeter explores proportion and scale uses measuring tools appropriate for the task uses time and money in a context 4 estimates linear measurements with reasonable accuracy (in. ft cm, meter) uses directly measurable attributes such as length, perimeter, area, volume/capacity, weight/mass, money and temperature to describe and compare objects is beginning to recognize that all measurement is approximate uses basic ways of measuring the size of figures including length, width, perimeter and area determines when measurements are reasonable can describe the benefits of using standard units of measure (US and metric) selects and uses appropriate units of measure for length, weight, area, volume, time, and temperature measures and creates a scale in maps or scale drawings using the idea of constant ratio 5 estimates linear and volume measurements with reasonable accuracy selects and uses appropriate units for measurement and considers degree of precision required understands and uses scale in creating three dimensional objects acquires the ability to use appropriate tools recognizes that all measurement is approximate Next section: 1.3 3-5 Back to the Mathematics Framework Home Page",1.613718032836914],["Examples of this can be found at the Home Pages server VRML The Virtual Reality Markup Language is used to describe three dimensional spaces and objects which can be accessed, displayed and explored via World Wide Web.",1.5510241985321045],["Strand Bloom's Scope Hours Source Activities Patterns: Identify/Describe/Continue Application Master 5.0 Thornton Fractional Cooperative Classroom Home top Measurement Estimate Measurements: Non-standard The learner will be able to estimate length of various objects using non-standard units of measure.",1.5485132932662964]]
