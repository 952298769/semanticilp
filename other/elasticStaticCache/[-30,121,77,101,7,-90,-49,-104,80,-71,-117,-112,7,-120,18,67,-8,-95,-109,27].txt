Food All living things need food to get energy to carry out all the activities. Plants make their own food in the presence of water, sunlight and soil. Animals and human beings depend on plants for food. Non-living things do not need food for their survival. 2. Growth All living things follow a life cycle in which they are born, grow and finally die. A seed grows into a seedling, then into a plant and finally into a tree. A baby grows into an adult and finally becomes old. Animals also grow from babies to adults. As the living beings grow, they change in size, shape and appearance. Non-living things do not grow and they remain the same. 3. Movement All living things move from one place to another. Animals move in search of food. Some animals hunt for their food while others graze on grass. Birds fly in the air. Human beings roam for different activities. Plants though living do not move from place to place. They are help in the soil by their roots. Some parts of certain plants can move some of their plants like the leaves of certain plants close at night and open in the night and the branches of a sunflower always bend in the direction of sunlight. We need to push or pull to move a non-living thing. Non-living things cannot move on their own. 4. Breathe All living things need also to breathe and stay alive. All living things have an organ which helps in breathing. Human beings and many animals breathe through nose. Insects have tiny air holes in their body called as spiracles. Fish breathe though gills. Plants breathe through openings, called stomata, on their leaves. As non-living things do not have life, they do not breathe. 5. Reproduction All living things produce more of it’s kind with the process of reproductions. Some animals lay eggs while others including human beings give birth to young ones. Plants produce seeds. Non-living things do no reproduce. 6. Response Living things have sense organs (eyes, nose, tongue, skin and ears) due to which they respond to changes in their environment. Animals also feel and respond to changes in their environment. Bears hibernate in winters to protect itself from cold. Dogs have sharp sense of smell. Plants do not grow in the absence of light, water and air. Non-living things do not feel. They are not affected by any changes around them.

DRAFT April 10, 2014 96 Plants and animals have the same needs as humans. All living things need food, water and air. Plants need “food”, the minerals and nutrients from the soil, energy from the sun and water. They also need the carbon dioxide from plants. Humans and animals need enough nutritious food, clean water to drink, comfortable and safe home, and unpolluted air to breathe. Note: 1. Breathing in plants can be explained as the exchange of gases. The plants give off oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide from animals and humans. Eating in plants can be explained as the absorption of minerals and nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun. Drinking in plants can be explained as the absorption of water from the soil and movement as the reaction of the plants to gravity, sunlight and wind. 2. a. Activities common to humans, animals and plants include breathing, eating, drinking, movement and living in a habitat. b. Humans, animals and plants breathe the same air. The air they breathe is from the environment. c. Humans, animals and plants do not eat the same food but they get the food from one source, the environment. d. Humans, animals and plants drink the same water but not from the same source. The water they drink is from the environment. e. Humans, animals and plants do not live in the same habitat.
