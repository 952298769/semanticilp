Electrons (accompanied by protons) donated to oxygen gas to form water Carbon atoms cleaved, released as carbon dioxide Process Consumes Oxygen and Generate Carbon Dioxide and Water Called metabolic water to emphasize its source Provides sole source of water for some desert vertebrates Diluted into body internal water in other organisms Carbon dioxide can lower pH of body fluid and must be eliminated External respiration: uptake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide THE COMPOSITION OF AIR Composition and Properties of Air All oxygen in the air is a result of photosynthesis Dry air = 78.09% N2 + 20.95% O2 + 0.93% (argon + inert gases) + 0.03 CO2 Amount of air present decreases at high altitudes fig 46.1 At sea level, air pressure measures 760 mm of mercury fig 46.2 Equals the barometric pressure of air Equivalent to one atmosphere of pressure Each gas within the air exerts a partial pressure = 760 x % gas Nitrogen + inert gases = 760 x 79.02% = 600.6 mm Hg Oxygen = 760 x 20.95% = 159.2 mm Hg Carbon dioxide = 760 x 0.03% = 0.2 mm Hg Less air, therefore less oxygen present at high altitudes Barometric pressure above 6000 meters = 380 mm Hg Partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)= 380 x 20.95% = 80 mm Hg Only half the oxygen is available compared to sea level The Diffusion of Gases Across Cell Membranes Cell membranes of terrestrial organisms \nfreely permeable to oxygen Cell membranes cannot exist without a surrounding layer of water Oxygen concentration in cytoplasm lower than liquid surrounding cells Net diffusion of oxygen from environment into cells Net diffusion of carbon dioxide in opposite direction Gases redistributed by circulatory system Fick's Law of Diffusion Diffusion of oxygen into the epithelial aqueous layer is passive Driven by the difference in oxygen concentration between the interior of the organism and the external environment Mathematical relationship called Fick`s Law of Diffusion R = D x A x &Delta;p / d R = rate of diffusion D = diffusion constant A = area over which diffusion takes place &Delta;p = difference in partial pressures on each side d = distance across which diffusion takes place Evolutionary changes optimize R by favoring certain parameters fig 46.3 Increase surface area Decrease distance d Increase concentration difference &Delta;p THE EVOLUTION OF EXTERNAL RESPIRATION fig 46.5 Simple Diffusion Oxygen diffuses too slowly to be efficient over more than 0.5 mm Severely limits size of organisms Protists are small enough to utilize simple diffusion fig 46.3 As size increases, surface area-to volume ratio decreases Surface area proportional to radius squared (r2) Volume proportional to radius cubed (r 3) Surface area-to-volume ratio proportional to r2/r3 or 1/r As the radius increases the ratio decreases Metabolism may be slowed down to compensate Increase in size must be accompanied by facilitation of diffusion of oxygen into organism Creating a Water Current Most primitive phyla possess no special respiratory organs Can obtain oxygen via diffusion by increasing &Delta;p in Fick`s equation Increase difference in O2 concentration by creating a water current Constantly replace water over diffusion surface &Delta;p does not decrease as diffusion proceeds Keep exterior O2 concentration high Results in higher realized value of R, rate of diffusion Increasing the Diffusion Surface Area More advanced invertebrates and vertebrates possess respiratory organs Increase surface area over which diffusion occurs Provides contact between external environment and internal circulating fluids Increase A and decreasing d Aquatic organs (gills) project from body into water Simple gills like papulae of echinoderms fig 46.3c Convoluted gills of fish fig 46.3e Increase in diffusion surface area enables aquatic organisms to extract more oxygen Enclosing the Gills Disadvantage of external gills Difficult to constantly circulate water past diffusion surface Neotenic amphibian larvae physically move gill through water fig 46.4 Inefficient, highly branched gills offer resistance against movement Special branchial chambers in other organisms pump water past gills Internal mantle cavity of mollusks opens to outside, contains gills Contraction of muscular walls draws water in and expels it Crustacean cavity lies between body and hard exoskeleton Movement of limbs draws water through branchial chamber THE FISH GILL AS AN AQUATIC RESPIRATORY MACHINE Most Successful Branchial Chamber Evolved in Bony Fishes Water passes through mouth into two opercular cavities Gills are located between mouth and entrance to cavity Water then passes out of body after passing over gills and through cavity One-way flow of water over gills Maintains high concentration of oxygen outside gills Continuously swimming fish have nearly immovable gill covers Water constantly forced over gills as fish swim Process is a form of ram ventilation Most bony fish have flexible gill covers fig 46.5 Inhales water into mouth Exhales water over gills and through opercular cavities Effects of Gill Construction on Parameters of Diffusion Structure of gills fig 46.6 Each gill composed of two rows of gill filaments that project into flow of water Filaments divided into thin, disk-like lamellae that lie parallel to water flow Direction of blood circulation runs opposite that of water flow Countercurrent flow maximizes &Delta;p between water and blood Advantage of countercurrent exchange fig 46.7a Least oxygenated blood meets least oxygenated water at back of gill Most oxygenated blood meets most oxygenated water at front of gill Diffusion occurs along entire length of gill If water and blood flowed in the same direction Oxygen-free blood would meet highly oxygenated water Diffusion would initially be high fig 46.7b Oxygenated blood would meet less oxygenated water at back of gill Diffusion would cease, only front part of gill would be functional Fish gills are up to 85% efficient FROM AQUATIC TO ATMOSPHERIC BREATHING More Oxygen Present in Air Than in Water Water = 5-10 ml O2 per 1 liter water Air = 210 ml of O2 per 1 liter air Many aquatic animals use air as their oxygen source Gills Not Adaptable for Terrestrial Use Air is less buoyant than water Lamellae lack structural support, collapse without water buoyancy Collapse reduces diffusion surface area Internal air passages remain open due to structural support Water diffuses into air through evaporation Terrestrial organisms constantly lose water to atmosphere Gills provide an enormous surface area for water loss Evolved two main kinds of terrestrial respiratory organs Both systems sacrifice efficiency to reduce water loss Tracheae of insects fig 46.3d Extensive series of air-filled passages within body Oxygen diffuses directly from trachea to cells, no circulatory intervention Openings close when CO2 levels are below certain point to limit water loss Lungs of terrestrial vertebrates Air enters and exits through one tube, minimizes evaporation Two-way flow of air replaces one-way flow Diffusion surfaces not exposed to pure fresh air &Delta;p is far from maximal, lungs are less efficient than gills Amphibians Low efficiency of lungs offset by high concentration of oxygen Efficiency not a critical problem to early land vertebrates Structure of the amphibian respiratory system fig 46.8 Lung is a simple convoluted sac Connected by trachea (windpipe) to rear of oral cavity (mouth) Opening controlled by glottis, sinuses connect oral cavity to nose Much oxygen obtained by diffusion across moist skin, cutaneous respiration Reptiles More active, greater metabolic need for oxygen Cannot obtain oxygen through watertight skin surface Changes within the reptile respiratory system Lungs possess small air chambers fig 46.8b \nLarger surface area for diffusion Mammals Metabolic demands even greater due to maintaining constant body temperature Lungs more highly branched with more alveoli clusters fig 46.8c Each alveoli cluster connected to main air passageway by short bronchiole All gas exchange occurs across walls of alveoli fig 46.3f Branching and alveoli vastly increase total surface area Humans have 300 million alveoli in two lungs Area about 42 times the surface area of body Active mammals do not have greater lung mass Have smaller, more numerous alveoli Thinner epithelial layer separates alveoli from blood Birds Metabolism of flying necessitates a more efficient respiratory system Avian lung works like a two-cycle pump fig 46.9 With inhalation air passes into posterior air sacs With exhalation air flows into lung With next inhalation, that air passes from lung to anterior air sacs Air flows out of the body with next exhalation Air flow is unidirectional from posterior to anterior Birds have no \"dead volume\" of air remaining in lungs as do mammals Air at the diffusing surface of the lung is fully oxygenated Direction of air flow is different from the flow of blood fig 46.10 Flow of air and blood are at 90% angles to one another Called cross-current flow Less efficient than fish, more efficient than mammals Birds can survive in much higher altitudes than mammals Birds increase &Delta;p value in Fick`s equation THE STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS OF THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Structure of the Respiratory Tree Air normally enters through nostrils Lined with hairs to filter out dust Extensive array of cilia further cleans and moistens air fig 46.11 Air passes through glottis Slit in larynx (voice box) Enters trachea, branches into two bronchi one for each lung fig 46.12 Bronchi further branch into smaller tubes, narrowest called bronchioles Trachea and bronchi reinforced with cartilaginous rings Bronchioles have only smooth muscle in walls Smooth muscle lining adjusts size of passageway Contraction stimulated by parasympathetic division of the nervous system Decrease in diameter by half increases resistance sixteen fold Sympathetic division relaxes smooth muscle, causes bronchodilation, decreases resistance Bronchodilation also caused by epinephrine Drug used to treat symptoms of asthma triggered by release of histamine The Structure of the Lung Terminal bronchioles deliver air to respiratory bronchioles Contain alveoli where gas exchange occurs Alveoli are outpouchings surrounded by capillaries Lines by epithelium only one cell layer thick Outside of lungs covered by visceral pleural membrane Inner wall of thoracic cavity lined by parietal pleural membrane Space between membranes called the pleural cavity Normally small and filled with fluid Fluid links membranes together like water film holds two sheets of cellophane together Lungs held tight to thoracic cavity Each lung has own pleural cavity, if one punctured other lung functional Air Flow in the Lung Human lung functions as one-cycle pump During inhalation or inspiration Rib external intercostal muscles contract raising the ribs fig 46.13 Diaphragm contracts, lowers and flattens Increases volume of thorax Due to coupling of pleural membranes, volume of lungs also increases Pressure of air in lungs decreases, air drawn into lungs fig 46.14 During exhalation or expiration Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax Structures of thorax return to previous condition Volume of thorax and lungs decreases Increases pressure of air in lungs, air forced out Extra air can be forced out of lungs Contraction of internal intercostal muscles lowers ribs Diaphragm pushed further up into thoracic cavity fig 46.13b Air volumes of human lungs Tidal volume: volume inspired and expired in a single breath About 500 ml of air Anatomical dead space: 150 ml within air passages Can be increased to 3000 ml during exercise Diffusion surface of lungs exposed to mixture of fresh and oxygen-depleted air Functional residual capacity (FRC): volume in lung after normal resting expiration Residual volume: volume in lung after maximal expiration Vital capacity: amount of air expired after forceful, maximum inspiration Emphysema reduces vital capacity Alveoli destroyed by cigarette smoking Respiratory rate: number of breaths per unit time Minute respiratory volume (MRV) Equals tidal volume x respiratory rate per minute Air entering and leaving lung per minute Normally 5 liters/minute, can be as high as 130 liters/minute Conditions associated with abnormal P CO2 Hyperventilation MRV extremely high CO2 removed from blood by ventilation faster than its produced by tissues Hypoventilation MRV unusually low Elevated P CO2 level Hyperpnea High MRV, high metabolic rate Normal blood P CO2 level GAS TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE Association of Respiratory and Circulatory Systems Transport of oxygen extremely slow if only by diffusion Transported through circulatory system via carrier Blood plasma holds maximum of 3 ml O2/liter Whole blood is able to carry 200 ml O2/liter Hemoglobin: oxygen carrier protein within the blood of most animals Four polypeptide subunit protein Each subunit combines with iron containing heme group fig 46.15 Hemoglobin picks up oxygen in lungs Bright red color when bound with oxygen Called oxyhemoglobin Hemoglobin releases oxygen at tissues Called deoxyhemoglobin Dark red color, looks blue under skin Hemoglobin widely distributed oxygen carrier protein throughout animal kingdom

venous blood is 40 mm hg, percent saturation is 75% Graphical representation is an oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve fig 46.16a At rest, 22% (97-75) of the oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen to tissues One fifth of oxygen unloaded in tissues, four-fifths in blood as reserve Blood can additionally supply oxygen needs at exercise If venous blood P O2 is 20 mm Hg, saturation is 35% fig 46.16b Amount unloaded now 62% (97-35) Blood contains reserves for 4-5 \nminutes without breathing Presence of CO2 at metabolizing tissues Combines with water to form carbonic acid, lowers pH of blood Occurs in red blood cells, hemoglobin has less affinity for oxygen Hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily Dissociation curve shifted to right, called Bohr effect fig 46.17 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (DPG) also shifts curve to right fig 46.17 Also augments unloading of oxygen Production inhibited by oxyhemoglobin Anything that reduces oxyhemoglobin causes production of DPG Example: high altitudes Low P O2 of air lowers level of oxyhemoglobin Immediately causes rapid fatigue Red cells produce DPG after a few days, shifts curve to right Stimulates unloading of oxygen, lessens fatigue After a few weeks, kidneys produce erythropoietin Stimulates bone marrow to produce more red cells Hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide (CO) Binding to CO more efficient than to O2 CO not readily

Ecosystems Are the Most Complex Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria

nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively

metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs,

consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids

filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of
