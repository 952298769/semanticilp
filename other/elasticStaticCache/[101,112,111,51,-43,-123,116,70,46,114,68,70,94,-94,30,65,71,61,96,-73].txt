Friendly mothers could, in theory, influence their kittens in two distinct ways. First, they could pass on genes which help their kittens to socialize well with people. Second, they could influence their kittens' interactions with people directly. Kittens probably learn a great deal by copying their mother's lead, and if she is nervous or frightened when interacting with people, they may simply copy her. However, it is perfectly simple to arrange for a tom cat not to even see his kittens; since they cannot then copy his behaviour, he can only influence them through his genes. This lack of ambiguity is the reason why cat biologists have concentrated on the inheritance of behavioural traits from the father, rather than the mother. It has now been demonstrated several times that tom cats tend to produce kittens that are as friendly or unfriendly as they are themselves. Mothers must also tend to produce kittens that are as friendly or unfriendly as they are, although they will also influence their kittens' friendliness directly, through their own behaviour.\"",1.0690985918045044],["For example, if a cat has kittens, other cats will help raise them.",1.0573320388793945],["Inherited traits are characteristics acquired through the genetic information each parent contributes to the offspring.
