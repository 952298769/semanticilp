Artic animals adapt to the cold tundra. Adapting means the tundra animals are getting used to there biome. Sea mammals such as seals and walruses have blubber to keep warm. Land mammals have thick fur. Lemmings hibernate and are inactive during winter. That’s how the ecosystem works in this Artic tundra. ECOSYSTEM Animals help plants by eating the seeds then dropping seeds in other places. Also animals help plants by spreading pollen around to make the seeds grow. Plants help animals by providing hiding places allowing animals to blend into their environment so they can get away from their predators. 19",1.4324270486831665],["Frogs have very small ears hidden at the back of their head.

Many have thick coats of fur to insulate against the cold, and some hibernate. Others migrate to warmer areas in the chilly winters. Animal populations are mainly seed-eating squirrels and jays; small mammals like ermine and moles; and larger browsing animals such as deer, moose, elk, and snowshoe hare. The bogs and ponds in the taiga provide a great summertime breeding place for many different insects. Migratory birds often come to the taiga to nest and feed on all these insects. The typical predators for this area are grizzly bears, wolves, lynxes and wolverines. These are pretty ferocious, so their prey must adapt to flourish. Some animals hide from predators by changing color to blend into the different summer and winter habitats. For example, the ermine is dark brown in the summer, but in the winter it turns white.

For example, animal species that live in cold environments may have adaptive traits that help them survive and reproduce under those conditions, such as thick fur or antifreeze in their blood. Animals may also have adaptive behaviors that help them deal with the environment, such as storing food for periods when it is scarce, or hibernating during times of the year where conditions are most unfavorable. These adaptations are usually consistently seen in all individuals within a species. However, sometimes populations of the same species may be exposed to different conditions depending on where they live.

Those that have poor feeding skills will likely die off while those who are better at hunting are more likely to pass on their genes to future generations (Webster, 2000). This can be seen in the incredible behavioral adaptation that are seen in a group of dolphins living in the tidal marshes of Georgia. At low tide, this dolphin pod has actually developed a way to fish for prey in water that are only inches deep (Strege, 2013)!

However, the carnivores joined them, and when a drying climate triggered the spread of grass , they followed their prey out on to the plains . Grass is not easily digestible and most animals that eat it have to regurgitate it and chew the cud . Out in the open, the leaf-eaters had to develop means of protection. A few species turned into burrowers: examples include the blind mole-rat , which is completely underground, and the prairie dog , which isn't. The capybara — the largest rodent — spends much of its time in the water. Those that evolved long legs and hooves, such as the zebra and impala , seek safety in speed, while larger creatures, such as the rhinoceros , rely on their armoured hides. The elephant is the world’s largest land animal and is virtually invulnerable. Cheetahs and lions are attracted by those that herd in large numbers, like wildebeest . The cheetah uses its considerable speed while the heavier lion is a social predator, mostly using co-operation and stealth to capture its victims, and its methods are explored in detail.
