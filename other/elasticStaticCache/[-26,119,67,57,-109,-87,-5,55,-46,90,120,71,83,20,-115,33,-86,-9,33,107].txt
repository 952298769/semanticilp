Instead of migrating, many bat species go into hibernation. Hibernation is usually a safe way to pass the cold winter. However, if their deep sleep is disturbed too often, the bats may die. People visiting bat caves sometimes force hibernating bats to wake up. When the bats wake up, they use up their stored fat too quickly. For example, each time a little brown bat wakes up, it consumes stored fat that would have lasted for 67 days of deep sleep. And because few insects live in the caves during the winter, the bats cannot build up fat reserves during the winter.",1.6952829360961914],["top of page Hibernation About this time each year I become convinced that humans were once winter hibernators and that, in fact, some of us still are.",1.58589506149292],["Some taiga animals and birds migrate south, in the winter, where it is warmer, others go into hibernation, while others simply cope with the environment.",1.5601310729980469],["As with most bats, the little brown bat is mostly active at night and leaves its roost at dusk and the next two or three hours are peak activity periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.",1.4936919212341309],["As winter sets in on the Arctic the days become shorter and the wildlife settles in for winter with the bears going into hibernation and the migratory birds heading south.",1.4263945817947388],["As winter sets in on the Arctic the days become shorter and the wildlife settles in for winter with the bears going into hibernation and the migratory birds heading south.",1.4263945817947388],["Hibernation: Some mosquitoes (for example most species of Anopheles and Culex) hibernate in winter at adult stage.",1.389258861541748]]
