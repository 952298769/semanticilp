evolution&quot;--Theodosius Dobzhansky &quot;The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all&quot;--Sir Peter Medawar Biological Species Concept Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1963) Defines species in terms of the gene pool, isolated from other similar gene pools Paleospecies A paleospecies or chronospecies is a morphologically or anatomically defined fossil species Since interbreeding cannot be determined for fossil species, species boundaries are determined by similarity of form The more difference there is between two fossil critters, the more likely they are members of separate species In a long-lived lineage with continuous fossil representation, an arbitrary species line will be drawn when &quot;enough&quot; difference is seen Speciation The process by which new species are produced from earlier ones This is the central process of macroevolution, or evolution at the level of the species or above (genus, family, etc.) Microevolution involves evolutionary change at the level of the population, and is defined by changes in allele frequencies within the population The Origin of Species Speciation occurs when populations of a species become reproductively isolated so that they can no longer interbreed with full fertility Geographic isolation of populations usually initiates the process Separated by a river, desert, volcano, etc. Selection operates to produce isolating mechanisms of anatomy and behavior Modes of Evolution Cladogenesis is branching evolution, the production of two or more daughter species from a single ancestral species Anagenesis is linear evolution, the production of a single daughter species from a single ancestral species Tempo of Evolution Gradualism views evolutionary change as occurring at a slow, steady, incremental rate over time Punctuated Equilibrium views the tempo of evolution as consisting of long periods of stability (equilibrium), followed by relatively short periods of rapid evolutionary change (punctuations) The Evolutionary Record The Cosmos Big bang estimated to have occurred between 12 -

a serious matter before modern dentistry more labor leads to more arthritis and other wear-and-tear ailments living in permanent villages creates new problems of sanitation (waste disposal, insect infestation, etc.) that encourage disease living in larger groups aids the spread of epidemic diseases ovarall, settled agricultural lifestyles typically increase biological stress on people and often decrease lifespan more children are produced, but they have a shorter life expectancy in theory, these two trends could cancel each other out but the observed pattern is that in most or all cases, the net effect is still a population increase Agriculture and sedentism have cultural effects, too: Agriculture requires investment of labor to make a plot of land productive land that has been cleared, tilled, etc. is more valuable than the rest of the countryside so people will tend to claim ownership of improved land, and become tied to it for at least a season, and often longer Sedentism allows accumulation of material goods: storage of goods and food thus the origins of rich and poor people and classes so sedentism makes economic stratification possible accumulation is not limited to a single generation, either;",0.7021684646606445],["This convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).",0.7004014849662781],["This change in fur coloration is most likely due to (1.)",0.6998783349990845],["Some species will lose most of their dense fur or thick bark which has become a hindrance to temperature regulation in the new warmer climate.",0.6989766359329224]]
