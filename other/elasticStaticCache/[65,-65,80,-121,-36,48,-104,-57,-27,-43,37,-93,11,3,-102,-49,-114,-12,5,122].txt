Population Dynamics of Predation we can look at effects of predation on the population dynamics (i.e., changes in density over time) of both the predator and its prey we will begin by considering a relatively simple model based on differential equations considering just one predator and one prey species: Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model here we have two basic components : C = number (or density) of the consumer (= predator) population N = number (or density or biomass) of the prey or plant population here we have two simultaneous differential equations , one for the prey and one for the predator 1) PREY POPULATION GROWTH RATE: prey population growth rate = exponential birth rate - predator-caused death rate assumption #1 : in the absence of predators, the prey population increases exponentially, i.e., no density-dependence: dN/dt = r N but prey individuals are removed (i.e., killed) by predators: the rate of removal depends on the rate of predator-prey encounters and the efficiency of the predator encounters increase as: 1) the number of predators (C) increase 2) the number of prey (N) increases the predator&#146;s efficiency can be designated a', the &quot;attack rate&quot; of the predator&#151;a' increases with: 1) increasing search efficiency 2) increasing capture efficiency assumption #2 : a' comes from linear functional response: the rate of successful encounters (i.e., the consumption rate) will then be: a'CN and the overall equation for the prey population dynamics becomes: dN/dt = r N - a'CN (a) 2) PREDATOR POPULATION GROWTH RATE: predator population growth rate = birth rate - background mortality rate in the absence of food (prey), individual predators lose weight and starve to death therefore, in this model, predators are assumed to suffer a &quot;background&quot; mortality&#151;decline exponentially through starvation in absence of prey: dC/dt = -qC where: q = mortality rate this lose of predators is counteracted by predator birth, which depends on: 1) the rate at which food (prey) is consumed: a'CN 2) the predator's efficiency (f) of turning this food into predator offspring there are two additional assumptions here: assumption",1.653218150138855],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources, habitat destruction, and other factors such as predation and climate limit the growth of certain populations in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack or resources and other factors, such as predators and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.\"",1.6427192687988281],["Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in specific niches in the ecosystem.",1.6427192687988281],["Last updated 3/26/01 --- Populations are composed of genetically variable individuals Populations have tremendous potential to grow, but growth is limited by competition, predation, diseases, etc.",1.6382737159729004],["Rat predation was limiting the population growth of the extant Cahow population.",1.625604510307312],["Environmental Resistance Factors Lack of habitat Lack of available food supply Lack of competitive skills to find resources Susceptibility to Predation Disease Parasites Unsuitable weather conditions When we have a balance between growth and environmental resistance, populations, an ecosystem will fluctuate around a carrying capacity , the level of resources (food, shelter, etc.) which is available to support a number of individuals, with accommodations to social action, predation disease, etc. Ecosystems in balance do not demonstrate a growth pattern based on their biotic potential, but have a pattern of logistic growth, one which fluctuates around the carrying capacity.",1.614134430885315],["It's the amount or lack of food, not increased predators that is limiting moose populations in the Yellowstone area, says a University of Nevada researcher.",1.6084187030792236],["Several factors contribute to the limited population growth, including low genetic diversity, lack of quality habitat, and predation on eggs, goslings and adults by introduced predators.",1.6047508716583252],["Related Riverdeep activities: Carrying Capacity, Exploring Food Chains and Food Webs, Population Growth Curve, Factors Affecting Population Growth, Two Populations &#151;
