As carcasses are often solidly frozen when encounter, brown bears may sit on them to thaw them sufficiently for consumption. While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at ungulates at one point in their lives, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive. [38] On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items mainly comprised by ungulates. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age. [38] They are the most regular predator of ungulates among extant bear species. [318] The extent of hunting behavior differs by region. For example, in Slovenia , ungulate meat was four times more likely to be obtained as carrion than through hunting, while on the contrary in east-central Alaska , live hunting of ungulates was four times more likely than scavenging of carrion. [319] [320] The extent of carnivory in brown bears has been proven to increase at northern latitudes. [321] When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive. [322] Despite being characterized as unskilled predator with minimally refined hunting skills, most individual bears who are routine ungulate-predators have shown the ability to vary their hunting strategy and have hunting success rates comparable to other large, solitary carnivorans. [323] [324] Brown bears will on occasion bite or swipe some prey in order to stun it enough to knock it over for consumption. [187] To pick out young or infirm individuals, bears will charge at herds so the slower-moving and more vulnerable individuals will be made apparent. Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent. [7] Despite being characterized as a danger to ungulates mostly on spring neonatal young in the first couple days of life when they have undeveloped legs and cannot run at full speed, young ungulates may be pursued well into summer or fall after they’ve developed running abilities. [325] [326] Most attacks on adult ungulate occur when the prey has some variety of physical disadvantage. When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow. [187] Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil. [7] On rare occasions, most importantly for confronting unusually large, fully-grown and dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison. [38] [327]",0.6504122018814087],["A complete answer to this seemingly simple question is more complex than expected, as life span varies among species. Within a species, life span may also depend upon latitude…, time of year, and even local weather conditions. *Edit*This is information from another website. Please do not copy them. _ _ Adult Life Span Marking studies suggest that winged adults of many (and perhaps most) species live only a week or two, and that the male tends to live a few days less than the female. However, in some species, the adult life span of some generations may be much longer. For example, in some species, adults that emerge in late summer or early fall hibernate overwinter in a sheltered spot. Also fall-hatched monarch butterflies migrate south in fall and northward in spring. Adults of these species may survive for 8-9 months or longer. _ _ Total Life Span Total life span includes time spent in the larval and pupal stages, as well as the adult stage. Each species description in Butterflies and Moths of North America includes the number of annual \"flights\" for that species. A flight is a generation of adults. Thus, if a species has \"two flights from May through September\" it means that one generation will emerge from the pupal stage in spring and a second in summer. Actual months of emergence depend on latitude. Life spans of these two generations will be very different depending upon the species' strategy for getting through the winter. _ _ If the spring flight comes from eggs that were laid in fall by the previous year's summer flight, the total life span for the spring flight is 10-11 months. Eggs laid in May/June by those adults develop much more rapidly, due to higher temperatures, and adults emerge in about 2-3 months, resulting in a total life span of 3½-4 months for the summer flight, or less than half that of the spring flight. However, if the species is one in which adults of the summer flight overwinter, then the spring flight develops from eggs laid in spring, and in this case the summer flight is the longer-lived generation. _ _ Not all species have two flights per year. Some species, particularly northern ones, have only a single flight annually, or a total life span of about a year. Some Arctic butterflies are believed to have a 2-year life cycle due to the extremely short growing season and the scarcity of high quality food for the larval stage. And some desert species, which normally have a life cycle of only one year, may hibernate as larvae or pupae for up to 7 years waiting for adequate rainfall to ensure growth of the host plant. On the other hand, southern species may have numerous fast-developing but short-lived generations each year. Finally, among the many species that are distributed over a wide latitudinal zone, it is not uncommon for northern populations to have one or two flights annually while more southerly populations have many flights annually. In some cases, the number of flights is considered taxonomically significant; for example, the Eastern and Canadian tiger swallowtails are now recognized as separate species, partially based on the fact that the Canadian Species has only one flight per year vs 2-3 for the Eastern species. _ _ Average Life Span Often people want to know the \"average\" life span of a butterfly or some other species. This is a very different question than the one answered above, as it requires knowledge of age-specific death rates. These are not known for free ranging Lepidoptera (or indeed for most wild animals). About all that can be said is that only a minute fraction of larvae survive to adulthood, and the average butterfly life span or life expectancy is correspondingly much shorter than the figures given above would indicate. diffrent butterflies live for diffrent years For 10 weeks 14 days",0.6496981978416443],["For example, the feeding program for nonbearing trees should promote rapid growth in the late spring and early summer, followed by complete cessation of growth by September.",0.6480718851089478],["The delayed perceptions of the reader are also often taken into consideration as is shown in the following example: \"The seasons try their colour schemes here/always springing summer on us in passing/falling forever into winter sleep\" (5-7): corresponding to the climatic conditions of the far North, there is in fact only the summers with their abrupt, aggressive outburst which 'spring on' us and the long winter sleep when nature also falls asleep, but of course, 'spring' and 'fall' as verbs belonging to summer and winter are at least absorbed by the ear thus managing nevertheless to complete the full cycle of seasons contrary to all expectation.",0.6437138319015503],["Winter, Spring 2000 1 hour and 15 minutes From Seed to Tree Explore the wonder of the life cycle of the mighty tree!",0.6433003544807434],["The Périgord truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is endemic to calcareous soils in southern Europe and found in symbiotic association with the roots of deciduous trees, mostly oaks (Quercus spp.) and hazelnut trees (Corylus avellana). The fungus requires a host tree to complete its life cycle and produce hypogeous fruit bodies, so-called truffles. The meiotic spores germinate in the spring producing a vegetative (haploid) mycelium growing in the soil and the rhizosphere. They colonize root tips where they establish the mutualistic ectomycorrhiza symbiosis. Extramatrical hyphae growing in the vicinity of the ectomycorrhizal root systems then aggregate to form fruit body initials. The latter develop a fruiting body which maturates during early Winter completing the truffle life cycle. In the mature truffle the ascogenous heterokaryotic pseudotissues, resulting from an unknown fertilization process after outcrossing, are surrounded by homokaryotic maternal pseudotissues. After meiosis the ascospores are dispersed mainly by mycophagous animals including wild boars and rodents. The spores pass through the digestive tract and are dispersed in the faeces over short distances (several kilometres). Tuber species are found in temperate, mediterranean, and continental climates.
