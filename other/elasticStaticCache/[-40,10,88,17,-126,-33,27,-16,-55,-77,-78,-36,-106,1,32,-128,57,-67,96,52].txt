terpenoid or phenolic Autecology - the study of the ecology of any individual species Clone - organisms all dervied from a single progenitor by asexual means Dormancy - life stage of temporarily reduced metabolic activity Genet - an individual plant grown from one sexually-produced seed or all the individuals produced by vegetation reprocution from one such plant Iteroparous - capable of reproducing many times Monocarpic - dying at the end of its first fruiting season as do annuals, biennials and some perennials Phenotypic plasticity - ability of a individual to display different phenotypic characteristics depending upon conditions during growth Polycarpic - potentially able to fruit many times Ramet - any physically and physiologically independent individual plant, grown either from a sexually-produced seed or from vegetative reproduction Relative growth rate (RGR) - (ln(W(t2)) - ln(W(t1)))/(t2 - t1) where W(t) is dry weight of plant or plant part at time t Secondary compound - metabolites which do not function in the biochemical activities which support growth (e.g. photosynthesis, respiration, protein synthesis) - includes alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids which may function in plant defense Self-thinning - density-dependent mortality in plant populations such that population density decreases as plant size increases Semelparous - reproducing once in its lifespan Synecology - the study of the relationships between communities and their environment Plant Life Cycle: Seed bank in soil - recruitment of seedlings - growth in mass and numbers of plant modular units - seed production Processes affecting within-population dynamics include genetic (frequency dependent and independent selection, outcrossing rate, inbreeding depression) and ecological (deensity dependent and independent effects, pollen limitation, demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity) A typical method to analyze plant life cycle effects on population-level processes is to break the population into comparments corresponding to seeds, seedlings, juveniles, adults - sometimes these are related to plant size (biomass, leaf number, etc.) Dispersal Gadgil pointed out that dispersal may limit population sizes due to: (i) Availability of sites for germination are few (ii) habitable areas are too far apart relative to the dispersal capabilities of the species (iii)carrying capacity of the habitable sites is low (iv) time for which sites are suitable is too short relative to the dispersal rate of the species (v) habitability of a site is too short (e.g. successional displacement is rapid) (vi) colonization and full exploitation of carrying capacity of a site is low Seed dispersal distances are affected by mode of dispersal (wind, water, animal, plumes, wings, etc.), and activity of dispersing agent (wind speed, animal presence) Dormancy Typically occurs in the dispersal phase of plants Not only way plant can survive under adverse seasonal environmental conditions - alternative is seasonal dimorphism - two distinct growth phases adapted to different seasons (some desert shrubs which have large leaves for wet season and small leaves for dry season) Innate dormancy - seeds \nborn dormant, viable but not capable of germinating under good conditions when released from parent Induced dormancy - acquired dormancy - inability to germinate

Mating is accomplished via the growing together of hyphae sourced from different parents (e) We can summarize a generalized fungal life cycle as follows ( ploidy is in parentheses): (i) Sexual reproduction: (1) Mycelium ( n ) (2) Plasmogamy (process) (3) Dikaryotic stage ( n + n ) (4) Karyogamy (process) (5) Diploidy (2 n ) (6) Meiosis (process) (7) Spore-producing structures ( n ) (8)

Only following nuclear fusion are fungi diploid , and in fungi mitosis does not occur in the diploid state (c) However, many fungi routinely achieve a diploid-like state following cytoplasmic fusion ( plasmogamy ) called a dikaryon state or stage (7) Plasmogamy (a) Though fungi nuclei are typically haploid , that doesn't stop haploid nuclei from different fungal parents (e.g., mom and dad equivalents) from being present in the same cytoplasm (b) The process by which the cytoplasms of two parental fungi fuse is called plasmogamy (c) Note that plasmogamy may be followed by nuclei fusing, though this does not necessarily occur immediately, and for some fungi the time until nuclear fusion occurs can be greatly extended (d) [ plasmogamy ( Google Search )] [ index ] (8) Dikaryon state or stage (a) The post- plasmogamy condition in which two different haploid nuclei occupy the same cytoplasm is a dikaryon state or stage (b) Being a dikaryon, since cytoplasms are shared, provides the

form dikaryonic zygosporangia that are capable of toughening to form a dormant stage (d) Zygosporangia give rise to sporangia following germination, karyogamy , and meiosis (e) Sporangia may also be formed from haploid tissue in asexual reproduction by mitosis (f) See Figure 31.6, Zygomycota (zygote fungi): the life cycle of the zygomycete Rhizopus (black bread mold) (g) [ Zygomycota ( Google
