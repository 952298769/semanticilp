there are costs, as well as benefits, to deep beaks deep-beaked birds more often die as juveniles this is not well explained, but may be because they have slightly higher food requirements while they are growing during the normal, wet years, there was a balance between the mortality of the shallowest-beaked birds due to their greater difficulty finding food as adults, and the mortality of the deepest-beaked birds due to their difficulty finding food as juveniles birds with average-sized beaks were the ones most likely to survive natural selection was balanced, or &quot;stable&quot;, so it maintained the status quo this situation is called an &quot;equilibrium&quot; During the drought, the benefit of having a deep beak increased, but the cost apparently did not increase as much so having a deep beak became advantageous and the selection ceased to be &quot;stabilizing&quot;, but instead became &quot;directional&quot;, favoring birds with deep beaks Stabilizing and directional selection are essentially the same process the only difference is whether the optimal characteristic is already the most common, or not as long as more individuals are born than survive and reproduce, selection is always going on Boyd and Silk point out that stasis (staying the same) is no more &quot;natural&quot; than change both require explanation, which the theory of evolution gives us The finch example illustrates that species are not fixed, unchanging types of organisms instead, species are populations of organisms with individuals that are different from each other what defines the species is the distribution of various characteristics among the individuals who make up the population -- what traits are common, what traits are rare, what is the average of traits like beak depth this distribution of traits many change over time, if directional selection occurs, or may remain constant, if stabilizing selection occurs Finally, notice that natural selection acts on individuals , not the group Individual organisms live or die, reproduce or don't and the result is shifting distributions of traits like beak depth that reflect the results of this selection among individuals This process of selection of individuals does have a net effect on the population, but the actual process works individual by individual, not on the group as a whole This distinction is important, because it shows that natural selection does not consider how the traits affect the group or the species as a whole natural selection, acting on individuals, might favor traits that are advantageous for individual organisms, but are disadvantageous for the group as a whole natural selection can even drive the whole group to extinction Consider Boyd and Silk's hypothetical example of high-fecundity vs. low-fecundity females (fecundity is the ability to produce offspring) high-fecundity females produce more offspring;",0.8480110168457031]]
