Since students saw in the last activity that heating water increases the rate of evaporation, they should realize that some of the hot water must have been evaporating pretty quickly, filling the air inside the cups with the gas water vapor. As water vapor moves away from the hot water it cools. It also cools when it comes in contact with the inside surface of the top cup. When the water vapor cools enough, it changes state, becoming tiny drops of liquid water.
