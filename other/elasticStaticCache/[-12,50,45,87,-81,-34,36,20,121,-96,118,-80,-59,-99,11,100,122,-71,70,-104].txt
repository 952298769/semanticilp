although the total energy of the universe remains constant, matter tends to become steadily less ordered as various energy transfers occur (e.g., by collisions in chemical and nuclear reactions, by light waves and other radiations), and the energy tends to spread out uniformly Knows that all energy can be considered to be either kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (depends on
