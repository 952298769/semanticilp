The condition needs treatment at body temperatures of 35C (95 F) or below. And hypothermia becomes life threatening below body temperatures of 32.2 C (90 F). The signs and symptoms of hypothermia depend upon the body temperature. The major initial sign of hypothermia is a decrease in mental function that leads to impaired ability to make decisions. Tiredness or lethargy, changes in speech, and disorientation are typical. The person will act as if they are \"drunk.\" The body gradually loses protective reflexes such as shivering which is an important heat-generating defense. Other muscle functions also disappear so that the person cannot walk or stand. Eventually consciousness is lost. Recognizing hypothermia can be difficult for the symptoms at first resemble other causes of change in mental and motor functions such as diabetes, stroke, alcohol or drug use, etc. The most important thing is to think of the possibility and be prepared to treat it.",1.103170394897461],["Shivering occurs as body temperature drops from 97 F down to about 90 F.

It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. [1] It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss.

[1] [2] Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F) through thermoregulation .

Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards. [15]",0.9833018183708191]]
