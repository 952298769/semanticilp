water systems can also be used as cooling and heating sources... ground water is usually isothermal (constant temperature), while air changes temperatures seasonally... because water holds heat more effectively than air idea is to draw heat from water in the winter to warm homes and offices and pumping heat into water in the summer ( heat pumps ) Geothermal Energy and the Environment low
