Electrical conductors should not be coated with dielectric grease prior to being mated. However, dielectric grease is often applied to electrical connectors, particularly ones which contain rubber gaskets, as a way to provide a nonconductive lubricant and sealer for the rubber portions of the connector. The widest use of dielectric grease is in high-voltage connections associated with spark plugs. The grease is applied to the rubber boot of the plug wire. This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the rubber boot, while at the same time preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally spark plugs are in located in areas of high temperature, and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected.",1.856146216392517],["The conductor is surrounded by a porcelain or silicon rubber insulator, which also provides electrical and mechanical strength to the bushing.",1.8369163274765015],["Water is a conductor – not an insulator and when you touch an electrical point with wet hands you get a solid shock because the earth being a good conductor and water being a conductor uses our body as a means for the electricity to flow from the point of contact into the earth.
