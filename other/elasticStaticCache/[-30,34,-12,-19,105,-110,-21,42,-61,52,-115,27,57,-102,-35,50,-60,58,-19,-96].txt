sequence or estimate distance, volume, and quantity generate science questions and seek information through a variety of sources perform multiple tests before accepting or rejecting results analyze scientific explanations base conclusions on scientific evidence obtained from a variety of sources Earth and Space Science Students: investigate and understand public policy decisions related to the environment explain how renewable resources are managed (water, air, plant life, animal life) explain how nonrenewable resources are managed (coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power) discuss and determine cost and benefit tradeoffs in conservation policies Students: understand the elements of weather by recording data and making weather predictions use weather software and the Internet to collect real-time weather data construct and use weather instruments to collect weather data identify and describe components of weather including precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind, fronts, and air pressure identify weather instruments such as rain gauge, thermometer, psychrometer, anemometer, wind gauge, and barometer identify cloud types and describe general weather conditions related to the formation of major cloud types--cirrus, cumulus, and stratus use knowledge of the water cycle including evaporation, condensation, transpiration, and precipitation to predict atmospheric
