have nine major organ systems which make the seven life processes: 1) The Digestive System Digestion breaks down food into simpler substances so it can be used and absorbed into the body It takes place in the alimentary canal, (food tube), mainly in the stomach and small intestine Digested food is absorbed into the blood system 2) The Respiratory System This is for taking in oxygen and removing waste carbon dioxide Air enters the lungs by movement of the rib muscles and diaphragm Oxygen is absorbed into the blood system 3) The Excretory System This removes toxic and other waste materials from the body.",2.403073310852051],["it is found everywhere that bacteria or other germs can easily invade the body, specifically in the linings of the parts of the body exposed to the
