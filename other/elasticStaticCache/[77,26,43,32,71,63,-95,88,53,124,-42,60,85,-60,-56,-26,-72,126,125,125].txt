[["Thermal expansion When materials are warmed up, they expand If two different metals are stuck together to form a strip, when heated one will expand more than the other and the strip will bend Thermal expansion thermostat Home Heat Sources - Furnaces Straightforward in operation: Oil or natural gas is burned, releasing heat Electric furnaces flow current through resistors Electrical energy is transferred to the resistors, causing them to heat up (think of a light bulb or electric range) Heat is transferred to either air or water, which are used to move the heat around the house Ways to improve efficiency: More efficient burners more efficient heat transfer mechanisms Electric heat Net efficiency: about 30% power plant: 33% transmission lines: 91% conversion to heat: 100% radiant heat -- small heaters in each room instead of central heat;",1.6102378368377686]]
