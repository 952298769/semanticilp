Toronto Area (GTA) ( Toronto Rocks p 3-4, 10-11) Layer II is the bedrock which consists of limestones interlayered with shales the fossils found in these rocks show that their depositional environment

Niagara Escarpment forms a ridge along the western boundary of the GTA It reveals bedrock (the solid rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water that is driven off when clay minerals are heated Types of Metamorphism Fig 6.19, p. 139 regional
