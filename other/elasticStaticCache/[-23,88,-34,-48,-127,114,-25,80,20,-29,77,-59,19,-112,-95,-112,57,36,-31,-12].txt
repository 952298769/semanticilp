roots widen cracks burrowing animals - actively break rock and bring material from depth, exposing it to chemical weathering at the surface human activities - construction, farming 17 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES SUMMARY Mechanical Weathering: 1) produces smaller pieces of rock 2) does not change the composition of the rock 3) adds to the effectiveness of chemical weathering 4) may lead to the formation of talus slopes 18 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals - reactions that alter the internal structure of minerals subtract and/or add elements, changing the composition of the rock 19 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING The Role of Water in Chemical Weathering - it takes part directly in most chemical reactions - it acts as a medium of exchange by introducing and transporting elements to the minerals - it removes the product of weathering to expose fresh rock surfaces for further weathering 20 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) SOLUTION ( Dissolution ) - rock material passes directly into solution by dissociation of the constituent ions in a liquid e.g. salt dissolving in water NaCl = Na+ + Cl- ** most minerals are slowly soluble in pure water, the presence of small amounts of acids increases solubility by providing excess hydrogen ion (H+) 21 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) SOLUTION ( Carbonation ) Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks e.g. H2O + CO2 = H2CO3 = H+ + HCO3 - and CaCO3 + H+ + HCO3- = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- - important action in limestone terrain where solution features lead to Karst Topography - responsible for hard water (Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) - some rocks can be completely dissolved and leached away, few outcrops exist except in deserts 22 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - reactions of minerals in rocks with oxygen to form oxides (hydroxides if water is present) - commonly occurs as rusting e.g. 4Fe + 3O2 = 2Fe2O3 (iron oxide or hematite) - oxidation of pyrite e.g. FeS2 + O2 + H2O = FeO(OH) + H2SO4 23 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 2) OXIDATION - important in the alteration of Fe/Mg minerals (olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite) and mafic rocks (basalt and gabbro) where oxidation imparts a red color to altered basalt) - the production of acids from spoil banks (mine tailings) that are transported by runoff from rainfall into streams killing fish and making water unfit for drinking is of environmental concern 24 CHAPTER 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS CHEMICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 3) HYDROLYSIS -

Weathering Chemical decomposition of minerals For example iron in mafic minerals rusts(or oxidizes) Accelerated in hot humid climates water promotes movement of chemicals and can participate in chemical reactions chemical weathering is accelerated in warm, moist conditions Table 5.1 p. 99 High temperature minerals in Bowen's reaction series are more suseptible to chemical weathering Mechanical and Chemical Weathering Cooperate with one another Fig 5.11 p. 99 mechanical weathering increases surface area for a given volume surface area is more suseptible to chemical weathering chemical weathering softens \nmaterial and makes it more prone to mechanical weathering Transportation by water, wind or ice Fig 5.19 method and length of transportation reflected in the shape of particles method of transportation reflected in sorting by size Environment of Deposition Fig 5.20, p. 107 Characterized by temperature, water depth and salinity etc. Examples, Desert Dunes (continental), Beach (transitional), Coral reef (marine) Use clues found in rocks such as rock type, sedimentary structures(bedding, Fig 5.27, p.113 cross-bedding, ripple marks, mud cracks, gutter casts), fossils Submarine Fans as an example Fig 5.28 sediment carried far out to sea by turbidity currents graded bedding is sedimentary structure Lithification turns loose sediment such as sand grains into rock such as sandstone compaction (particles brought together by weight of overlying sediment) cementation (particles glued together by chemically precipitated minerals including quartz, calcite and hematite) Classification see Table 5.3 p 108 Detrital rocks names based on particle size for example, rocks made of sand-sized particles are called sandstones chemical sedimentary rocks named for the dominate mineral that they contain for example, rocks made up of the mineral calcite are called limestones limestones are the most common chemical sedimentary rocks, most contain calcite skeletons of organisms such as coral Sedimentary Rocks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) ( Toronto Rocks p 3-4, 10-11) Layer II is the bedrock which consists of limestones interlayered with shales the fossils found in these rocks show that their depositional environment was a warm, shallow sea Layer III consists of geologically young Quaternary sediments deposited by glaciers or in glacially-influenced lakes these sediments have not been cemented into rocks The Niagara Escarpment forms a ridge along the western boundary of the GTA It reveals bedrock (the solid rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water that is driven off when clay minerals are heated Types of Metamorphism Fig 6.19, p. 139 regional occurs when rocks are deformed by combinations of high temperatures and/or high pressures especially important at convergent plate margins Fig 6.5, p. 130 contact occurs when magma alters the rock it intrudes Fig 6.7, p. 131 dynamic occurs when rock ground up with movement along a fault Shock metamorphism due to impact of meteorites can create diamonds Classification of Metamorphic Rocks Table 6.2, p. 133 broadly divided into those rocks that have a foliation and those that are not foliated Foliation a parallel arrangement of elongated minerals for example platy minerals such as micas Fig 6.9, p.134 produced when minerals become oriented due to differential pressure Foliated Metamorphic Rocks named on the basis of the size of the minerals grains and their shape or granularity slate consists of microscopic mineral grains its foliation causes it to split into flat layers that can be used for billiard and pool table tops Fig 6.10, p. 134 gneiss (pronounced \"nice\") consists mainly of granular minerals its foliation is seen in alternating bands of of felsic (light) and mafic (dark) minerals Fig 6.12, p.135 Nonfoliated Metamorphic Rocks contain granular rather than platy minerals that have increased in size through recrystallization Fig 6.15, p. 137 and 6.14, p. 136 marble forms by contact or regional metamorphism of limestone Metamorphic Rocks are found in the Canadian Shield that underlies Toronto ancient Precambrian marble and gneiss make up Layer I or the \"basement
