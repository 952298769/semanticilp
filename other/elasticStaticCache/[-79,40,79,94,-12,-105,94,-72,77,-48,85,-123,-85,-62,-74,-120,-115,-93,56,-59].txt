Water falls to the Earth in the water cycle, and gravity pulls the water (or ice) down hill, carrying sediment with it (erosion). As the speed of the water slows as the slope decreases, the larger and larger pieces of sediment are settled out of the water by the force of gravity, becoming deposited someplace else. If there is no water present, sediment can be transported by any other fluid as well, usually air in the form of wind. As the wind slows, gravity is again the main factor in deposition.
