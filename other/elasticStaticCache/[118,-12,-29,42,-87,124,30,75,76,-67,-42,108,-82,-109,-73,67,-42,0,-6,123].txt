animals explore environment via locomotion Plants and fungi move by growing Animals Use Contraction of Muscles to Move The Mechanical Problems Posed by Movement Motion Requires Countering the Force of Gravity Chemical energy in the form of ATP provides force ATP 9 ADP + Pi Releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole Protists wave cilia resulting in movement Animals compress and shorten structural elements in muscle cells Vertebrate Locomotion Results When Force of Muscle Contraction Moves Bones at Joints BONE: THE STRUCTURAL MATERIAL OF THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON Structure of Bone Special form of connective tissue Organic extracellular matrix of collagen fibers Impregnated with hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) Collagen fibers run in all directions Hydroxyapatite crystals aligned with long axes and curved ends of bones Composition is unique Hydroxyapatite is strong and rigid but brittle Collagen is flexible but weak If hydroxyapatite crystal breaks, it runs into collagen before another crystal Collagen distorts and dissipates stress Adjacent crystals not exposed to same stress Formation of Bone A bone is living, dynamic tissue New bone formed by osteoblast cells Secrete collagen fibers that are subsequently calcified Osteocytes: mature osteoblasts trapped within bone Lamellae: concentric layers of bone surrounding Haversian canals Haversian canals interconnect, carry blood vessels and nerve cells Blood flow allows osteocytes to remain alive when embedded in calcified matrix Two types of bone formation Flat bones like skull Osteoblasts located in web of dense connective tissue Produce bone within that tissue Long bones Cartilage skeleton initial template for bone formation Bone formed as cartilage degenerates Bones of vertebrate skeleton composed of two elements fig 44.2 Ends and interiors are open lattice of spongy bone tissue Spaces contain marrow Most blood cells formed in bone marrow Surrounded by concentric layers of compact bone tissue Bone is much denser Gives bone strength to withstand mechanical stress JOINTS: SITES OF ATTACHMENT BETWEEN BONES fig 44.3 Bones Interact at Joints or Articulations Three Kinds of Joints fig 44.3 Immovable joints Called sutures Example: cranial bones Open areas of dense connective tissue in fetus as skull is not fully formed Slightly moveable joints Bones bridged by cartilage Example: vertebral bones in spine Pads of cartilage are intervertebral disks Cushion and allow flexibility Also called cartilaginous joints Freely moveable joints Called synovial joints Articulated end located within synovial capsule with lubricating fluid Ends of bone capped with cartilage Bones move in direction dictated by structure of joint Arm-shoulder joint has ball-and-socket structure Elbow joint has hinge-like movement THE HUMAN SKELETON Endoskeleton of Humans Composed of 206 Bones fig 44.4 Axial skeleton: supports the main body axis Appendicular skeleton: supports arms and legs fig 44.5 Motor control systems system control two divisions independently The Axial Skeleton 80 bones compose skull, backbone and rib cage Skull: 28 bones include cranium, facial, middle-ear and hyoid bones Vertebral column = spine = backbone 33 vertebrae compose flexible column that protects spinal cord 12 pairs of ribs attach in front at breastbone (sternum) to protect heart and lungs The Appendicular Skeleton 126 bones attached to axial skeleton at shoulders and hips Pectoral girdle: shoulders Shoulder blades connected to breastbone by collarbones (clavicles) Attach to arms with 32 bones each, most in hands Pelvic girdle connects to legs, 30 bones each including foot MUSCLES: HOW THE BODY MOVES Animals Possess Specialized Cells Devoted Exclusively to Contraction Vertebrate Muscle Cells Composed of filaments of actin and myosin proteins Vertebrates possess skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cells THE STRUCTURE OF SKELETAL MUSCLE Skeletal Muscles Produce Movement of Skeleton fig 44.6 Muscles attach to bones Are usually attached to two different bones May be attached to another structure like skin Connection of muscle to bone called tendon Attachment at origin remains relatively stationary during contraction Insertion end of muscle is attached to bone that moves Muscles May Work in Groups Synergists produce same action at joint Antagonists produce opposing actions Example: lower leg muscles fig 44.7 Quadriceps group cause lower leg to extend, leg moves away from thigh Flexor muscles of thigh (hamstrings) contract and bring lower leg toward thigh Quadriceps muscles are synergists Quadriceps and hamstrings are antagonists Muscles that antagonize are relaxed when opposing set is contracted Microscopic Anatomy of Skeletal Muscle Each muscle contains numerous muscle fibers Cells specialized for rapid contraction and production of large force fig 44.8 Each fiber encloses bundle of 4-20 myofibrils Have cross-striations that produce alternating light-dark appearance Muscle fiber itself has striated appearance Skeletal muscles thus are striated as are cardiac muscles Myofibrils built of long chains of repeating sarcomeres Sarcomere subunits bounded on each end by Z line disk of protein Light and dark banding results from thin and thick myofilaments Thin filament: globular actin proteins twisted into double helix fig 44.9 Thick filament: myosin protein each with a protruding head fig 44.10 Thin and thick filaments interdigitate Occurs near border between light and dark bands Myosin heads extend toward thin filaments CONTRACTION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE Molecular Aspects of Muscle Contraction Muscle contraction associated with cleaving ATP to ADP + Pi At rest myosin heads function as ATPase enzymes Hydrolysis activates myosin heads In this orientation, they can bind to sites on actin filaments Myosin and actin bind when muscle is stimulated to contract fig 44.11 Binding constitutes formation of a cross-bridge between actin and myosin Cross-bridge formation causes conformational change Pulls thin filament toward center of sarcomere fig 44.11b Binding another ATP detaches myosin head from actin Lack of ATP in dead animal \ncauses myosin to remain bound to actin Causes stiffened condition called rigor mortis Cleaving that molecule activates myosin head again Myosin head is slightly closer to the Z line at the next cycle fig 44.12 Repetition of many cycles causes sarcomeres and myofilaments to shorten Thin filaments slide between thick filaments fig 44.13 Process called sliding filament mechanism of contraction Shortening of myofibrils produces tension in muscle fibers and whole muscle Will cause motion if force is greater than opposing forces, like gravity Muscle generates maximum tension if it contracts when at normal resting length Optimal overlap of thin and thick filaments Permits formation of maximum number of cross-bridges At very long length no cross-bridges can form since no overlap of thin and thick filaments At short lengths thick filaments collide with Z line, preventing further shortening Initiation of Skeletal Muscle Contraction Does not occur spontaneously, stimulated by nervous system Five step process Motor neuron produces electrical impulse carried to ends of axon Forms synapses called neuromuscular junctions with one or more muscle fibers Neuron releases acetylcholine as chemical neurotransmitter Excites muscle fiber, stimulates it to produce impulses Muscle fiber impulses carried along sarcolemma (plasma membrane) Also carried along infoldings called transverse tubules fig 44.14 Tubules extend deep into muscle fiber Closely apposed to sarcoplasmic reticulum, specialized ER that surrounds myofibrils Impulses along transverse tubules stimulate release of Ca++ Calcium ions stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum Released into cytoplasm Involves regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin Tropomyosin lies against thin filament Troponin bound to tropomyosin fig 44.15 In resting fiber Ca++ in cytoplasm is low Tropomyosin located close to thin filament myosin-binding site Troponin blocks myosin heads from binding to actin Prevents contraction In stimulated fiber Ca++ released by sarcoplasmic reticulum binds to troponin Ca++-troponin complex pulls tropomyosin from myosin-binding sites on actin Cross-bridges can form Cross-bridge cycle continues if Ca++ stays attached to troponin (ATP available) When nerve activity stops so do muscle fiber impulses Ca++ actively transported back to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ released from troponin, tropomyosin returns to position on thin filament Prevents myosin heads from binding to actin Muscle fiber relaxes Process called excitation-contraction coupling Neurons produce electrical excitation of muscle fiber Electrical excitation indirectly produces myofilament sliding and contraction Coupled to contraction through action of Ca++ Summation Twitch: single brief contraction Muscle fiber stimulated by single impulse on motor neuron Fiber contracts rapidly and relaxes Summation Result of repetitive firing of motor neuron innervating muscle fiber Insufficient time for relaxation between twitches Second twitch adds to first, fiber contracts further Tetanus: no visible relaxation between twitches Produces smooth, sustained contraction Recruitment Each skeletal muscle fiber innervated by only one motor neuron One motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibers Motor unit: set of muscle fibers controlled by one neuron fig 44.16 Motor unit with few fibers requires lowest level of activation Results in small contractile force For greater force more motor units are activated Isometric and Isotonic Contractions Isometric contraction: constant length contraction Muscle length cannot shorten with internal contraction Example: trying to lift an immovable object Increases tension of muscle Isotonic contraction: constant tension contraction Muscle shortens under constant load Can change to isometric and back Muscle Energy Consumption Formation of cross-bridges requires large amounts of ATP Isometric contractions have higher rate of energy use than isotonic ATP production by glycolysis Rapid but less efficient Produces lactic acid ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation Produces greater amounts of ATP Requires constant source of oxygen to cells Rapidly contracting muscle starts with oxidative phosphorylation, switches to glycolysis The Oxygen Debt Oxygen consumption remains high at end of strenuous exercise Extra oxygen consumed refer to as oxygen debt Some oxygen associated with metabolism of lactic acid Accumulated lactic acid must be metabolized to CO2 and H2O Cori cycle fig 44.17 Lactic acid converted to glucose in liver Returned to muscle Muscle Fatigue Use-dependent decrease in ability to generate force Mainly occurs from operating under anaerobic conditions High activity causes buildup of lactic acid Acid conditions interfere with cross-bridge formation Also depletes stores of glycogen in muscle and liver Energy production then comes from fat Production half that of glucose energy production Marked decrease in muscle performance Cardiac Muscle Composed of striated fibers, orientation different than skeletal fibers Composed of chains of single cells with individual nuclei Electrically coupled to neighbors by gap junctions Form single, functioning unit called myocardium Structure critical to heart muscle function Contraction initiated at one location called pacemaker Not initiated by impulses in motor neurons Impulses spread from pacemaker throughout myocardium via gap junctions Cells in each chamber of heart contract in synchrony Molecular mechanism of force generation is same as in skeletal muscle Contraction ejects blood from heart chamber, relaxation allows chamber to fill Impulses last longer than in skeletal muscle, allow for blood to be forced out Cardiac muscle does not produce summated contractions or tetanus Smooth Muscle Surrounds hollow internal organs like stomach, intestines, bladder, uterus, blood vessels (except capillaries) Long, spindle-shaped cells with individual nucleus Individual myofibrils of actin and myosin not organized into sarcomeres Parallel arrangements of thick and thin filaments cross diagonally Thick filaments attached to dense bodies or plasma membrane Have 10-15 thin filaments per thick filament Striated muscle fibers have 3 thin filaments per thick filament Smooth muscle cells do not have sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ comes from extracellular space Ca++ combines with calmodulin Complex activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) MLCK phosphorylates myosin heads, permitting formation of cross-bridges Strength of contraction increases with amount of Ca++ that enters cytoplasm Drugs can block entry of Ca++ into cells, causing vascular smooth muscles to relax Blood vessels dilate Reduces work heart must do to pump blood through them Some smooth muscles contract only when stimulated by nervous system Example: muscles lining walls of blood vessels, in iris of eye Called multiunit smooth muscle Cells not coupled together, must be activated \nas separate units Other smooth muscle like gut lining can contract spontaneously Contain special cells that produce electrical impulses Spread impulses to adjacent cells through gap junctions Leads to slow, steady contraction of tissue Called unitary smooth muscle, electrical coupling causes muscle to contract as unit Smooth muscle can contract even when greatly stretched Example: uterus Internal organs are frequently stretched, must still be able to contract [Return to Chapter 44 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to Biology Home Page] Search | How to Order | E-mail Us Copyright &copy;1997

Chapter 43 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter 43 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION All Vertebrates Share the Same Body Plan and Operation Humans Are Representative Vertebrates of Special Importance THE HUMAN ANIMAL General Body Architecture fig 43.1 Digestive tube suspended within internal body cavity Coelom divided into two parts Thoracic cavity: heart and lungs Abdominal cavity: stomach, intestines and liver Supported by internal skeleton of jointed bones Bony skull surrounds brain Column of hollow vertebrae surrounds dorsal spinal nerve cord Levels of Organization in the Body Four levels: cells 9 tissues 9 organs 9 organ systems Groups of cells with similar structure and functions are called tissues Three fundamental embryonic tissues: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm Four principal adult tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, nerve fig 43.2 Organs are a structural and functional unit composed of different tissues tbl 43.1 Example: the heart Contains cardiac muscle tissue wrapped in connective tissue Embedded with nerves and blood vessels Work together to pump blood through the body Organ system is group of organs that function together to carry out body activities Example: digestive system Humans contain eleven principal organ systems tbl 43.2 EPITHELIAL TISSUE FORMS MEMBRANES AND GLANDS Epithelium Covers Every Surface of the Body Examples Epidermis derived from embryonic ectoderm, comprises outer layer of skin Inner surface of digestive tract lined with endoderm derived epithelium Inner surface of Body cavities lined with mesoderm derived epithelium Functions of epithelial tissues Provide selectively permeable barrier Facilitate or impede passage of materials into underlying tissues Any entering or exiting substance must cross an epithelial layer that covers or lines all body surfaces Protect underlying tissue from dehydration and mechanical damage Provide surface for sensory nerve to act Secrete materials via glands Characteristics of epithelial layers Are only a few cell layers thick Cells contain little cytoplasm and \nhave low metabolic rates Possess few blood vessels, transport materials via diffusion Readily regenerated Two general classes Simple epithelium Stratified epithelium Further subdivided by cell shape Simple squamous: flat cells Simple cuboidal: equal height and width Columnar: height greater than width Simple Epithelium fig 43.3 A single cell layer thick Simple squamous cells Line lungs and major cavities Have irregular, flattened shape with tapered edges Permit rapid passage of molecules across membrane Simple cuboidal cells line small ducts inside glands Simple columnar cells line respiratory and gastrointestinal tract Interspersed with goblet cells Respiratory tract cells have cilia Surface of intestine is highly infolded to increase surface area Stratified Epithelium Several cell layers thick, named according to features of uppermost layers Epidermis is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium Has an upper layer of squamous cells Superficial cells are dead and filled with keratin Glands Derived from invaginated epithelia,produce various substances Two categories of glands Exocrine glands: connected to epithelium by a duct Product channeled to outside or to body cavity Includes sweat and oil glands (external), accessory digestive glands (internal) Endocrine glands: connection with epithelium lost, ductless Secretions called hormones Hormones enter blood capillaries, don't leave body CONNECTIVE TISSUE S PERFORM A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS Structural Building Blocks fig 43.4 Derived from mesoderm Divided into two categories Connective tissue proper: loose and dense Special connective tissue: cartilage, bone, blood Composed of widely-spaced cells imbedded in an extracellular matrix Loose Connective Tissues fig 43.5 Cells scattered within amorphous, protein ground substance Strengthened by collagen, elastin and/or reticulin fig 43.5 Fibroblasts secrete collagen and fibrous proteins fig 43.6 Contains other living cells Mast cells produce histamine and heparin Phagocytic macrophages defend against invading organisms fig 43.7 Aided by cells that leave blood capillaries and enter loose connective cells May contain adipose cells Each cell stores a droplet of fat Number of fat cells in an adult is usually fixed, can change in size Dense Connective Tissue Contains tightly packed collagen fibers May be regular or irregular In regular tissue collagen fibers are lined up in parallel Tendons bind bone to bone Ligaments bind muscle to bone In irregular tissue fibers have different orientations Tough coverings of organs like capsules of kidneys and adrenal glands Perimysium covers muscles, perineurium covers nerves, periosteum covers bones Cartilage Has special ground substance made from characteristic glycoprotein Collagen fibers laid down along lines of stress Produces firm, flexible tissue that is tough and doesn't stretch Cushions bone joints, makes up skeleton of agnathans, cartilaginous fishes Chondrocytes remain alive even with no blood vessels Bone Cartilage hardened by calcification, cells die, replaced by living bone Osteoblasts are bone cells that remain alive even though matrix is hardened with calcium phosphate Hardest tissue in body may be organized into a delicate lacework fig 43.8 Blood fig 43.8 Contains abundant matrix material: fluid plasma Cells include erythrocytes (red cells) and leukocytes (white cells) fig 43.9 Thrombocytes or platelets are fragments of a type of bone marrow cell Erythrocytes are the most common blood cells Lose nucleus, mitochondria and ER during maturation Metabolically are relatively inactive Has iron-containing hemoglobin protein, carries oxygen Several types of leukocytes Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils have special affinity to biological stains Neutrophils are most abundant, phagocytic Mononuclear phagocyte system: During infections monocytes enter loose connective tissue and become macrophages Monocytes, macrophages, organ-specific phagocytes Lymphocytes are second most abundant leukocytes, part of immune system fig 43.7 Blood plasma contains nutrients and metabolic wastes Also contains sodium, calcium, other inorganic salts Includes proteins like fibrinogen and albumin Contains lymphocyte-produced antibodies MUSCLE TISSUE PROVIDES FOR MOVEMENT Muscle Cells Are Motors of the Vertebrate Body Possess large numbers of actin and myosin filaments, specialized for contraction Three types of vertebrate muscle: smooth, skeletal and cardiac fig 43.10 Skeletal and cardiac are also striated muscles Smooth Muscle Earliest form to evolve, found throughout animal kingdom Cells are long and spindle-shaped, each with one nucleus Cells organized into sheets to form smooth muscle tissue Two types of contraction occur All muscles contract as a unit when stimulated by nerve or hormone: i.e. muscles lining blood vessels Individual cells contract spontaneously causing slow, steady contraction of the tissue: i.e. muscles in the walls of the gut Contraction is involuntary and cannot be consciously controlled Skeletal Muscle Attached to bones by tendons, contract and cause bones to move Numerous muscle cells called muscle fibers act in concert Stronger contractions result when more fibers within muscle contract Contraction due to substructures called myofibrils fig 43.11 Contain highly ordered arrays of actin and myosin filaments Fibers produced during development by the fusion of several cells fig 43.11 A single fiber runs the length of an individual vertebrate muscle Each fiber contains all of the original nuclei of the fused cells Cardiac Muscle Vertebrate hearts made of specially arranged striated muscle fibers Composed of interconnected cells, each with its own nucleus Interconnections appear as lines called intercalated disks fig 43.10 Lines are really regions where cells are linked by gap junctions Interconnections allow heart to contract as single unit Functioning unit called myocardium Certain muscle cells generate spontaneous electrical impulse Impulses spread across gap junction from cell to cell All cells in myocardium ultimately contract Contraction represents one heartbeat NERVE TISSUE CONDUCTS SIGNALS RAPIDLY Composition of Nerve Tissue fig 43.12,13 Neurons: specialized for transmission of nerve impulses Cell body contains the nucleus Dendrites Thin, highly branched protrusions from the cell body Receive stimulation Axon Long tubular extension of the cell body Transmit nerve impulse away from the cell body Axon can be long, resulting in long nerve cell May be covered with insulating layer called myelin sheath Derived from Schwann cells Periodic interruptions called Nodes of Ranvier Nerves Are Bundles of Axon Fibers Central nervous system (CNS): link brain and spinal cord Peripheral nervous system (PNS): nerves and ganglia Sensory neurons: conduct impulses \nfrom sensory organs to CNS Motor neurons: conduct impulses from CNS to muscles or glands Interneurons/association neurons: neither sensory or motor neurons Comprise majority of neurons in CNS Responsible for information processing Supporting Cells of the Nervous System Neuroglia are supporting cells Provide more than just physical support Essential for prop[er functioning of nervous system Example: Schwann cells in PNS that make myelin HOMEOSTASIS Cell Specialization Requires Limited Extracellular Conditions Homeostasis definition: dynamic consistency of the internal environment Conditions are not constant but fluctuate within narrow limits Regulating Levels of Glucose in Blood Large amount of glucose in body after meal Glucose absorbed by liver cells Converted to glycogen for storage When blood glucose levels fall below normal Liver converts glycogen to glucose Releases glucose into blood Little change in blood plasma glucose level over time Regulating Body Temperature Neurons detect temperature increase over 37% C (98.6% F) Input to hypothalamus Triggers mechanisms to dissipate heat Induces sweating, dilation of blood vessels in skin and other things Decrease in body temperature Induces shivering and constriction of skin blood vessels Raises body temperature, corrects challenge to homeostasis Homeostasis Is Maintained by Negative Feedback Loops Feedback loop monitors body conditions and corrects deviations Negative feedback: reverse changes to condition, reduces disturbance fig 43.14 Keep value of controlled variable close to preferred set point value Sensors monitor control variable, send data to integrator Integrator compares value to set point Deviations from set point, perturbations, cause integrator to send error signal to an effector to bring about change Example: driving a car fig 43.14b Variable = position of car in lane Sensors = eyes of driver Integrator = driver's brain Setpoint = center of lane Perturbations = bumps or curves in road Error signals = deviations from setpoint Deviations result from perturbations, car off center Opposed by system of effectors, car kept in center of lane Setpoint in physiological systems may change Body temperature lower during sleep Temperature higher during fever Controls involve complex interactions between organ systems Positive Feedback Loops Are Unstable In positive feedback the disturbance is accentuated Perturbations cause effector to drive controlled variable even farther from set point Analogous to spark that ignites an explosion Example: blood clotting One factor activates another Produces cascade that leads to formation of a clot Example: contractions of uterus during childbirth fig 43.15 Stretching of uterus by fetus stimulates contraction Stimulates further stretching, more contraction Final result: fetus expelled from uterus Positive feedback systems are part of larger mechanism that maintains homeostasis [Return to Chapter 43 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page]

at dendrites If membrane excitation is enough it triggers impulse sent along axon Electrical current travels outward from cell body Generally only one for each cell body, may be quite long Single axon in a giraffe may be three meters long Neuron Support System Structural and functional support supplied by neuroglia cells Comprise half of the volume of vertebrate nervous systems Include Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes fig 47.2 Envelop axon at particular intervals, form myelin sheath Insulating material of layers of neuroglial membrane fig 47.3 Interrupted at nodes of Ranvier Nerve: bundles of myelinated and nonmyelinated fibers fig 47.4 Myelinated axons have myelin sheath Unmyelinated axons lack myelin sheath THE NERVE IMPULSE The Membrane Potential Potential difference in electrical charge exists between two poles Example battery terminals One pole positive, other negative Cells have potential difference across plasma membrane Side of membrane exposed to cytoplasm is negative Side of membrane exposed to extracellular fluid is positive Cellular voltage called membrane potential Resting membrane potential: cell not producing impulses Generally about 70 millivolts, written -70 mV Origin of membrane potential Ionic compound in water dissociates into ions, forms electrolyte solution Positive ions are cations Negative ions are anions Example: table salt dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions Cellular electrolyte solution different from extracellular solution Cytoplasm contains negatively charged proteins and organic phosphates K+ is 30 times more concentrated in cytoplasm than extracellularly Na+ and Cl- are 10-20 times higher in extracellular fluid tbl 47.1 Concentration gradients form between inside and outside of cell Net diffusion of Na+ and Cl- into cell Net diffusion of K+, proteins and organic phosphates out of cell Cell membrane permeability Impermeable to proteins and organic phosphates, trapped in cytoplasm Somewhat permeable to Na+, K+ and Cl- Permeability due to ion channels, Membrane-spanning transport proteins with water-filled pores When open ions can diffuse through Channels are specific for only one kind of ion Permeability in resting neuron Channels with open pores are selective for K+ Cell is more permeable to K+ than any other ion If only K+ could pass, it would reach an equilibrium state No more net movement, diffusion out equals diffusion in fig 47.5 Membrane potential called equilibrium potential Value is about -90 mV for most vertebrates True resting potential different since some open channels are Na+ not K+ Na+ diffuses in through these channels Equilibrium potential for Na+ is +60mV At rest neither Na+ or K+ is in equilibrium K+ continually diffuses out, Na+ continually diffuses in Sodium-potassium pump also contributes to membrane potential Cell membrane potential can change in response to stimulation Depolarization: shift in positive direction (-70 mV to -50 mV) Hyperpolarization: shift to more negative (-70mV to -85 mV) Generation of Action Potentials Nerve and muscle cells have unique Na+ and K+ channels Have gates, protein portion opens or closes pore with change in membrane potential Channel called voltage-gates ion channel fig 47.7 Gates for Na+ and K+ are closed at resting membrane potential Open in response to membrane depolarization, allow ion to flow through If initial depolarization is strong enough action potential is generated fig 47.8 Depolarization must reach cell's threshold level Typically -55 mV, 15mV more positive than resting potential No action potential produced if depolarization below this level Depolarization at this level opens both Na+ and K+ channels, Na+ first Rapid diffusion of Na+ into cell shifts membrane potential toward equilibrium potential for Na+ (+60mV) Membrane reverses polarity as Na+ rushes in On an oscilloscope this shows a rising phase of a spike fig 47.8 Membrane potential does not reach +60 mV because Na+ channels close At same time K+ channels finally open K+ diffuses out of cell restoring resting membrane potential Repolarization appears as falling phase on oscilloscope Repolarization may slightly undershoot and be more negative for brief period Entire sequence of events over in a few milliseconds Action potentials have three useful characteristics Produced only when depolarizing stimulus reaches cell's threshold When produced follow an all-or-none law Are always separate events, can not add together or interfere with each other Due to refractory period that exists after action potential is generated New action potential cannot form for a brief period of time Production of action potential results entirely from passive diffusion of ions At end cytoplasm has a little more Na+ and a little less K+ Active transport returns cell to normal Propagation of Action Potentials Action potential in membrane causes adjacent-gated channels to open fig 47.9 Each action potential serves as depolarizing stimulus for another action potential down the membrane Propagates action potential along axon or muscle cell Action potential remains same size along entire length, no strength lost Velocity of propagation dependent on fiber diameter and myelination tbl 47.2 Greater conduction velocity in larger fibers Myelination dramatically increases velocity via saltatory conduction fig 47.10 Myelin sheath interrupted at nodes of Ranvier Action potential jumps from node to node TRANSFERRING INFORMATION FROM NEURONS TO OTHER CELLS Synapses Axon/dendrite junctions, sites on muscles or gland cells Synaptic cleft: narrow intercellular gap between axon and target cell fig 47.11 Presynaptic membrane: side where axon transmits action potential Postsynaptic membrane: opposite side of cleft Signals cross synaptic cleft chemically Axonal ending on presynaptic side contain synaptic vesicles Vesicles contain chemicals called neurotransmitters With impulse, membrane depolarized, neurotransmitters released into cleft Chemicals bind to receptors on postsynaptic side Cause chemically gated ion channels to open Not opened by membrane depolarization like voltage-gated channels of axons Advantages of chemical junctions Different chemicals in different junctions permit varied responses More than sixty chemicals are transmitters or modify activity of transmitters The Vertebrate Neuromuscular Junction Synapse between axon and muscle cell fig 47.12 \nNeurotransmitter is acetylcholine (ACh) Acetylcholine molecules bind to receptors in muscle fiber membrane Open chemically gated channels that allow both Na+ and K+ to flow More Na+ enter than K+ leave, depolarize muscle fiber membrane Opens voltage-gated channels Action potential produced and conducted by muscle fiber fig 47.13 Depolarization excites muscle fiber: excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) Neuromuscular junction is an excitatory synapse Stimulates entry of calcium ions, triggers muscle contraction ACh must be destroyed for next transmission to occur or muscle remains contracted Acetylcholinesterase: enzyme that destroys acetylcholine Super fast-acting cleaves one ACh every 40 microseconds Organic phosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase fig 47.14 Nerve gases tabun and sarin, agricultural insecticide parathion Produce continual neuromuscular stimulation, cause paralysis of respiratory muscles Synapses Between Neurons Utilize ACh or other chemical transmitters, possess other possible outcomes Excitatory synapse Neurotransmitter opens both Na+ and K+ channels fig 47.15a Depolarization small compared to postsynaptic neuron's threshold Makes postsynaptic neuron more likely to produce action potential and EPSP Inhibitory synapse Makes postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate action potential Binding frequently causes hyperpolarization Membrane potential change called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) Neurotransmitter may be gamma-aminobuteric acid (GABA) Opens a Cl- channel Inward diffusion of Cl- produces hyperpolarization fig 47.15b Nerve cell can possess both excitatory and inhibitory synapses EPSPs and IPSPs from both synapses reach cell body Small EPSPs add together, IPSPs subtract from effects of EPSPs Process called synaptic integration fig 47.16 ORGANIZATION OF THE VERTEBRATE NERVOUS SYSTEM Composition of the Vertebrate Central Nervous Systems (CNS) Brain and spinal cord fig 47.17, tbl 47.3 Do most information processing Consist primarily of interneurons and neuroglia White vs. gray matter White matter: myelinated axons Gray matter: unmyelinated cell bodies and dendrites In spinal cord gray matter surrounded by tracts of white matter Ascending tracts carry sensory information to brain Descending tracts carry impulses from brain Go to motor neurons and interneurons in ventral part of spinal cord gray matter Control muscles of body Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Includes all nerve pathways outside of brain and spinal cord Somatic nervous system: motor pathway, stimulates skeletal muscle contractions Autonomic nervous system: regulates activity of smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, glands Nerves connect CNS with muscles and glands Also connect to ganglia Collections of neurons outside CNS EVOLUTION OF THE VERTEBRATE BRAIN Early Chordate Brains Were Quite Primitive Little more than swellings at end of nerve cord Served as sensory centers, received messages from sensory receptors Brains evolved independently in vertebrates, cephalopods, arthropods Basic Organization of the Vertebrate Brain fig 47.19 Hindbrain (rhombencephalon) Principal component of early brains Primary component of present-day fishes Composed of cerebellum, pons and medulla Extension of the spinal cord, coordinates motor reflexes Cerebellum is coordinating center Size increased in more advanced vertebrates Involved in evaluating limb position, muscle state, general body position Midbrain Composed of optic lobes in fishes Receive and process visual information Forebrain Compose olfactory lobes in fishes Receive and process olfactory (smell) information The Dominant Forebrain Further development in amphibians, more prominent in reptiles fig 47.20 Diencephalon: thalamus and hypothalamus Thalamus integrates sensory information Hypothalamus participates in basic drives and emotions, controls pituitary secretions Telencephalon Located in front of forebrain Devoted to associative activity Called cerebrum in mammals Expansion of the Cerebrum Ratio of brain mass to body mass fig 47.21 Discontinuity between fish/reptiles and birds/mammals Mammalian brains particularly large in comparison to body mass Cerebrum is the center for correlation, association and learning Receives sensory data from thalamus Issues motor commands to spinal cord via descending tracts Pyramidal tracts: major descending tracts Control motor neurons in spinal cord In turn stimulate skeletal muscles to contract ANATOMY AND FUNCTION OF THE HUMAN FOREBRAIN Cerebrum fig 47.22 Split into two cerebral hemispheres Connected by nerve tract = corpus callosum Hemispheres divided into lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal fig 47.23 Each hemisphere receives information from opposite side of body Controls motor activities on that side Damage due to stroke results in loss of sensation, paralysis on opposite side Cerebral Cortex Outer layer of cerebral surface Location of most neural activity Surface highly convoluted to increase surface area Three categories of activity: motor, sensory, associative Primary motor cortex Lies along posterior border of frontal lobe fig 47.23 Each point on surface associated with movement of a body part fig 47.24 Primary somatosensory cortex Lies along anterior edge of parietal lobe Each point receives input from sensory neuron on part of body Auditory cortex Lies within temporal lobe Surfaces associated with different sound frequencies Visual cortex Lies on occipital lobe Processes information from different positions on retina Association cortex Portion not occupied by any of the other motor/sensory cortexes Site of higher mental activities 95% of surface in humans, 5% of surface in mouse Basal Ganglia Buried deep within white matter of cerebrum, produce islands of gray matter Receive sensory information and motor commands from cerebral cortex Participate in control of muscle activity Damage produces tremor associated with Parkinson's disease Thalamus Primary site of sensory integration Relays information from sensors to appropriate area of brain Hypothalamus Integrates visceral activities: temperature, respiration, heartbeat Associated with limbic system Directs secretion of the pituitary gland, in turn regulates endocrine organs Interconnected with cerebral cortex and brainstem control centers Helps coordinate neural and hormonal responses to internal stimuli and emotions Limbic System Composed of hippocampus and amygdala Linked structures involved with emotional responses Hippocampus also involved with memory function and recall ACTIVITIES OF THE BRAIN Arousal and Sleep Reticular system is a diffuse collection of neurons in brainstem Reticular activating system controls consciousness and alertness All sensory pathways feed into this system When stimulated, increases level of activity in many parts of brain Neural pathways depressed by anesthetics and barbiturates Controls both sleep and waking states Easier to sleep in darkened room due to fewer visual stimuli Activity reduced by serotonin Activity measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) EEG signals associated with sleep \nSleep characterized by large alpha waves Slow-wave sleep associated with reduced body activities Dreaming occurs in REM phase of sleep Language Dominant (left in most people) hemisphere specializes in language Wernicke`s area interprets language and formulates speech Broca`s area generates motor output resulting in speech Spatial Recognition Specialization of the non-dominant (right) hemisphere Facial recognition site Involved with spacial relationships and musical activity Consolidates memories of non-verbal experiences Memory and Learning Memory not located in particular identifiable portions of the brain Removal of portions of temporal lobe result in impaired memory First stage of memory is transient, short-term memory Can be removed from the brain by electrical shock Long-term memories are preserved Long-term memory based on changes in synaptic efficacy Damage to temporal lobes, hippocampus and amygdala Affects short-term memory and memory consolidation Affects ability to process short-term into long-term memory Long-term potentiation (LTP) Synapses used intensively for short period have more effective transmission Presynaptic neuron may release increased amounts of neurotransmitter Postsynaptic neuron may become increasingly sensitive to neurotransmitter May be responsible for some aspects of memory storage PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Controls Voluntary and Involuntary Body Functions fig 47.25 Voluntary functions controlled by somatic system Involuntary functions controlled by autonomic system, endocrine glands The Somatic Nervous System Reflex Control of Skeletal Muscles Somatic motor neurons stimulate skeletal muscles to contract In response to conscious commands As part of reflexes that do not require conscious control Example: knee jerk reflex fig 47.26 Example of a muscle stretch reflex Sensory neuron makes excitatory synapse directly on somatic motor neuron When muscle stretched, sensory neurons excite motor neurons Action potentials in motor neurons cause muscle to contract Monosynaptic reflex: only one synapse crossed by reflex arc Most reflexes involve a relay of information Information from sensory neuron relayed through one or more interneurons Goes to motor neuron Motor neuron stimulates contraction of appropriate muscle fig 47.27 Function may be modulated by interneurons Dorsal root ganglia Axons of sensory neurons enter dorsal surface of spinal cord in dorsal root Cell bodies grouped in ganglia at each level in spinal cord fig 47.27 Motor neuron axons exit from ventral surface Dorsal and ventral roots combine to form spinal nerves fig 47.28 Antagonistic Control of the Skeletal Muscles Movement controlled by opposing sets of muscles fig 47.29 Muscles shorten and pull insertion toward origin Antagonistic actions produced when muscles attach to bones differently When one muscle contracts, other stretches Normally stretch in muscle produces reflex contraction When brain stimulates muscle to contract it also inhibits antagonistic muscle The Autonomic Nervous System fig 47.30 Composed of two elements that act antagonistically Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) Axons extend from brain and sacral spinal cord to visceral organs Synapse with neurons located in parasympathetic ganglia Axons from ganglia neurons innervate visceral organs Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) Axons leave spinal cord at thoracic and abdominal levels Travel short distance to chain of ganglia just outside spinal cord Synapse with neurons whose axons innervate visceral organs Control of the Autonomic Nervous System Two sets of neurons in PNS or SNS Preganglionic neurons have cell bodies in CNS, axons extend to ganglia Postsynaptic neurons cell bodies in ganglia, axons synapse with target organ Neurotransmitters Acetylcholine always at synapse between pre and postganglionic neuron Acetylcholine at second synapse with PNS Norepinephrine at second synapse with SNS Preganglionic sympathetic axons stimulate adrenal medulla to secrete epinephrine With SNS activation Visceral organs stimulated by norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons Also stimulated by epinephrine from adrenal glands These two chemicals initiate flight-or-flight reaction tbl 47.5 Heart beats faster, bronchioles of lung dilate Liver glycogen converted to glucose Digestive functions inhibited PNS promotes opposite response through release of acetylcholine Heart slows, bronchioles constrict, digestive functions stimulated Inhibited during fight-or-flight reaction Activated

different from cells specialized to use energy (muscle).",1.649782419204712],["A) The muscle twitch has three phases: lag phase, contraction phase, and relaxation phase 1) lag phase: the time from stimulation (action potential) to binding of calcium to troponin and exposure of active site on actin 2) contraction phase: formation of cross bridges between myosin and actin, and pulling on actin 3) relaxation phase: calcium transported to sarcoplasmic reticulum, troponin-tropomyosin complex block binding site, muscle fiber lengthens B) Muscle twitches last much longer than action potentials C) The strength of a muscle twitch is measured in terms of tension generated or movement produced D) A muscle fiber responds to action potentials in an all-or-none manner 1) each response to an action potential is identical, if conditions similar 2) response can change if conditions change: a) increasing Ca++ => stronger contraction b) depletion of ATP => weaker contraction E) Motor units respond in an all-or-none manner 1) all muscle fibers in the motor unit have an action potential in stimulated above threshold by the neuron 2) all muscle fibers in the motor unit contract in response to action potential in the neuron II) The response of whole muscle to stimulation is more complex than that of single muscle fibers A) Each muscle is composed of many motor units B) As the stimulus increases, the numbers of motor units responding increases, resulting in stronger contraction (multiple motor unit summation) C) Whole muscle exhibits graded response to stimulation 1) subthreshold stimulus 2) threshold stimulus 3) submaximal stimulus 4) maximal stimulus 5) supramaximal stimulus D) Since the duration of the contraction is longer than that of an action potential, the muscle fiber can be restimulated even before its relaxation phase is complete 1) incomplete tetanus: muscle fibers partially relax between contractions 2) complete tetanus: no relaxation between stimuli (constant contraction) E) Increasing the frequency of stimulation increases the strength of the contraction (multiple wave summation) III) Muscle contractions are classified as isometric or isotonic A) Isometric: muscle length constant, muscle tension changes B) Isotonic: muscle tension constant, muscle length shortens C) Concentric contractions: increase in tension, decrease in length D) Eccentric contractions: tension constant while length increases IV) The amount of active tension a muscle produces depends on the amount of stretching of the muscle A) As the length of a muscle increase, active tension increases to a point (better overlap of actin and myosin) B) If the muscle is stretched beyond the optimum length, active tension decreases (actin and myosin don't overlap enough) V) Types of fatigue A) Fatigue is the decreased ability to continue muscle contraction B) There are three types: 1) psychological fatigue: physiologically capable of continued work, but psychologically unable 2) muscular fatigue: depletion of ATP from the muscle 3) synaptic fatigue: depletion of acetylcholine from presynaptic terminals VI) Sources of energy for muscle contraction A) The energy required to produce ATP comes from three sources B) Creatine phosphate: 1) ADP + creatine phosphate => ATP 2) creatine phosphate stored in muscle 3) \nvery rapid production of ATP C) Aerobic respiration (see previous lectures) 1) produces lots of ATP 2) relatively slow ATP production 3) important in restoring depleted ATP and creatine following intense exercise (results in oxygen debt) D) Anaerobic respiration 1) produces less ATP (lactic acid formed) 2) faster than aerobic respiration E) byproduct of muscle metabolism: heat 1) increased activity = higher body temperature 2) shivering used to generate heat VII) Types of muscle fibers A) Slow-twitch (high oxidative) muscle fibers 1) contract more slowly 2) smaller in diameter 3) better blood supply 4) fatigue slower 5) primarily use aerobic metabolism 6) large amounts of myoglobin (binds O2) B) Fast-twitch (low oxidative) muscle fibers 1) more rapid breakdown of ATP, resulting in quicker contraction 2) less blood supply 3) fatigue quickly 4) utilize anaerobic metabolism more 5) little myoglobin C) Distribution of slow- versus fast-twitch 1) Fast-twitch: \"white meat\" of birds, animals a) chicken breast b) contract rapidly for short time 2) Slow twitch: \"dark meat\" of birds, animals a) chicken leg b) contract slowly for longer period 3) human: muscles mix fast and slow twitch a) muscles have both types of fibers b) can't change one type to another c) exercise can be used to develop both types VIII) Smooth Muscle A) Structure differs from skeletal muscle 1) smooth muscle cells are smaller than skeletal muscle fibers 2) single nucleus 3) myofilaments are fewer in number, and are not organized into sarcomeres 4) less abundant sarcoplasmic reticulum, with no t-tubule system B) Mechanism of contraction 1) Ca++ ions enter cell from extracellular fluid 2) Ca++ binds to calmodulin to activate myosin kinase 3) myosin kinase transfers phosphate from ATP to myosin 4) myosin forms cross bridge with actin 5) myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from myosin, cross bridges release C) Differences in structure and mechanism of contraction result in slower, more sustained contraction of smooth muscle, compared with skeletal muscle D) Smooth muscle is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (involuntary) IX) Cardiac Muscle A) Found only in the heart B) Structure and function: 1) cells communicate through intercalated disks 2) cardiac cells have intrinsic contraction rate 3) action potentials are longer in duration, with longer refractory period 4) single nucleus 5) striated C) Regulated by pacemaker cells in the heart, and by autonomic control",1.6368732452392578],["First, when the body needs energy for a muscle contraction, but is not undergoing major exertion, nervous stimulation will cause the
