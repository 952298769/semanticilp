Science (Microscopic World) It is expected that students will: describe all living things as being composed of cells identify the characteristics of various single-celled organisms describe the similarities and differences in plant and animal cells analyze the effects of micro-organisms on other organisms describe the human body's various defenses against harmful micro-organisms Physical Science (Chemical and Physical Changes) It is expected that students will: classify changes to matter as either chemical or physical identify factors affecting chemical and physical changes demonstrate chemical and physical changes Physical Science (Forces) It is expected that students will: identify the different types of forces describe the relationships among forces, motion, and mass Earth and Space Science (Space Exploration) It is expected that students will: outline the history of piloted and unpiloted flight identify the human and technological requirements for space exploration list the contributions that space exploration has made to everyday life describe Canada's contributions to space exploration evaluate piloted space exploration in comparison with unpiloted exploration Earth and Space Science (Solar System) It is expected that students will: describe the primary features of our solar system compare and contrast the conditions that support life on Earth with those on other planets and our moon relate the movement of the sun, moon, and Earth to seasons, tides, eclipses, and the phases of the moon Grade 7 Application of Science It is expected that students will: select an appropriate procedure for an investigation design an experiment involving two or more variables select appropriate equipment and techniques to collect useful quantitative and qualitative information investigate how models may be used to think about processes that cannot be observed directly evaluate conclusions in relation to other evidence and sources use graphs to summarize experimental data identify factors that have made possible or limited the work of particular scientists describe how technology and science are related propose and compare options when making decisions or taking action analyze costs and benefits of alternative scientific choices related to a community problem take responsibility for the safe and accurate use of equipment and procedures Life Science (Ecology) It is expected that students will: describe all organisms in terms of their roles as part of interconnected food webs describe ways in which species interact with each other compare and contrast the major biogeoclimatic zones of B.C. determine the limiting factors for local ecosystems outline the stages of recovery of a damaged local ecosystem Life Science (Body Systems - Reproduction, Growth, &amp; Change) It is expected that students will: compare and contrast asexual and sexual reproduction in both plants and animals describe the growth and changes in the development of an organism outline factors that influence the length and quality of life Physical Science (Environmental Chemistry) It is expected that students will: use the pH scale to classify a variety of substances identify chemical reactions that are important in the environment assess the impact of chemical pollution on a local environment collect, analyze, and interpret data on environmental quality Physical Science (Energy Sources and Options) It is expected that students will: describe different sources of energy that can be harnessed to produce electrical energy evaluate energy options available for particular purposes in the \ncommunity describe how electrical energy can be transformed into other forms of energy describe how scientific developments have influenced energy use through the ages Earth and Space Science (Astronomy) It is expected that students will: identify characteristics of known objects outside the solar system outline the changes in human understanding of the universe from early times to the present illustrate the seasonal position of various constellations Earth and Space Science (Earth's Crust) It is expected that students will: identify changes that occur to the Earth's surface due to earthquakes and volcanoes compare and contrast the geological features found on the ocean floor with those on the surface of the continents Science K-7 Integrated Resource Package Please direct any questions, comments or suggestions to Virtual Curriculum (EducationCurriculum@gems7.gov.bc.ca) Last Modified: April 16,
