LH) There are many other interactions between endocrine glands not shown on this chart- for example, epinephrine increases the secretion of glucagon Several Hormones are Involved in Control of Salt, Water and Osmotic Pressure Blood pressure, activity of nerves and muscles and other functions depend upon close regulation of body salt &amp; water ADH (antidiuretic hormone) causes water retention by causing water pores to be inserted in the collecting duct of the kidney Aldosterone increases Na reabsorption by the kidney (distal tubule) Secretion of these hormones is controlled by feedback loops: if the blood osmotic pressure is too high ADH secretion is increased if the blood volume falls aldosterone will increase (this involves 2 more hormones, renin and angiotensin which are not on the chart) a number of hormones are involved in the control of Ca Many Hormones Regulate Reproductive Functions Growth of the ovaries and testes and secretion of sex hormones is controlled by FSH and LH (we will cover this in another lecture) At birth oxytocin causes contraction of uterine muscles, aiding in delivery (doctors sometimes give injections of oxytocin) Milk production involves many hormones, including prolactin Milk ejection (letdown) when the baby suckles is also caused by oxytocin Hormones Control Metabolism &amp; Growth Thyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate (oxygen
