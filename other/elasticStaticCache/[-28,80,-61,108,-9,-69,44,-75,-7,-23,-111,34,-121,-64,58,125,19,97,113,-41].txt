Most of the ball’s gravitational potential energy goes into kinetic energy. However, some potential energy is wasted as thermal energy from friction as the ball collides with air molecules. Therefore, the ball has less kinetic energy on the return swing and cannot swing as high. 2) The click-clack machine has 5 balls. What happens to the balls’ gravitational potential energy when 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls are raised and dropped? List the series of energy conversions that occur when one ball is raised and released. As you raise one ball, chemical potential energy of your body is converted into gravitational potential energy of the ball. As the first ball drops, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When the first ball collides with the balls at rest, some kinetic energy is transferred from the first ball to the second ball and eventually to the last ball, which swings upward. Some of the first ball’s kinetic energy is converted into thermal and sound energy during the collision. As the last ball swings up, its kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy. If two balls are raised, some of their kinetic energy is transferred to the balls at rest and the last two balls swing upward. 3) Would the click-clack balls swing forever? Does a swinging click-clack ball reach the same height with each swing? What eventually happens to the gravitational potential energy the ball started with? With each swing, the ball’s gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (causing another ball to swing up), sound energy, and thermal energy. With each swing, the ball rises to a lower height. Eventually all of the original gravitational potential is converted into thermal and sound energy, and the ball comes to rest. c) Use the curved plastic track to roll or slide the toy car, marble, ping pong ball, and a wooden block with smooth and rough sides.

What actually happens is that a \"sound wave\" is actually the pressure or potential energy part of an acoustic wave. There is also a velocity component, or kinetic energy part that people keep forgetting about. When two waves interfere the potential energy density part of the two waves does go to zero but the kinetic energy density parts of the two waves double. Energy is conserved. I prefer to think of the collision as a way to change or transform the form of the energy density but not the fact of the energy density. The problem of \"where did the energy go\" is always that only one half of the total energy of the wave is being tracked. If you track both forms, you will see that the energy density stays constant, only its form changes. Art Noxon, Acoustical Engineer",0.7458584308624268]]
