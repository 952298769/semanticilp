up on the lie His Father's Father reserved him a place On the front row of saving grace Said he couldn't kneel Cause his suit was too tight He been heard praying sometimes But he's never saw the light He got hand me down, hand me down Hand me down religion He said the church has no business Tampering with a man's soul Cause he swears their ain't no devil Down in no big black hole If the devil doesn't exist If he's a creation of man Then man created the devil In his own image with his own hands Had a cigar in his mouth But he said he didn't smoke Had shoes on his feet But you didn't see him walk Slung cards like throwing knives But you never saw them stick Carried a pearl handled pistol But you never heard the hammer click Said he don't go to church to be preached at He got hand me down religion Business as usual His mouth as dry as a sack of flour Dusty as a lizards back Sitting on the davenport Fishing a cufflinks from a crack He sported two bellies One high one low Held his pants with a diaper pen Never let his pride show Chorus Some say he had his own teeth But I seen him slip'em in and out Jackolantern smile With a head full of cabbage in his mouth Played his nose like harmonica Hair in need of an oil change Smoked ox blood through chicken bones Used god's name in vain Chorus birds nest portland hair He knew she was trailer park trash Barley sky gave him a Pumpernickel rash Chorus Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Heard the sound of rain Dripping from a tin roof into a can of lard Like a tad pole on a dry rivers bed Took a swim to the nearest star I would be president but I'm not without sin You rode the bus while I jumped the fence Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Lived in a shotgun house Close to the tracks Spray painted your name On the over pass Is there grace without gravity faith for the blind The barns are raising the devils killing time I was a writer before I could speak And I spoke before I could think I've stopped to hear a still small voice Giving me freedom Giving me a choice Between the devil and the deep blue sea With jaundiced eyes on the road to perdition Always kept his powder dry All is fair in love and war Pursuing the apple of his eye Between you, me and the lamppost She was dressed to the nines But she tired men with her idle chit chat Not one word worth a cold thin dime Between the devil and the deep blue sea Every cloud has a silver lining Every ocean has a green eyed monster Dyed in the wool and still shinning Feet of clay and a pair of purple valentines Gave him the slip on weaver's run She's running with the hair hunting with the hounds With a slender reed the cat's on the prowl She became penny wise and pound foolish Couldn't make a silk purse out of a sows ear Living in clover squeezing blood from a turnip In a blue funk crying crocodile tears Left no stone unturned smart as a whip More than one way to skin a cat Spit and polish spic and span Bull in the china shop is wearing a brass hat He bought her love for a song She couldn't see the forest for the tree's Half a loaf is better than none Bought a pig in a poke with a head full of steam Action speaks louder than words Cut off her nose with a fish hook to spit her face Heaping coals of fire upon her head She's a millstone around his neck She threw the baby out with the bath water And put bats in the belfry Hell is paved with good intentions And a month of sunday's Don't you judge the preacher Don't call me good, there's only one that's good Jesus came to save sinners of which I am the worst (Drums kick in) Don't you judge the preacher The preacher he is judge God called preaching folly So don't you hold a grudge If you don't have the faith You can't understand it If you have the faith Nothing left to explain I have died to sin Used to walk in these ways Truth are in the headlines At the bottom of a bird cage Had my oxen in a ditch Jesus wept Sunday's turning black The rocks cry out Road Less Traveled The snow fell like butterflies The air was bitter cold I crossed the sugar tree field Warmed my bones in a worm hole Fire by night cloud by day I don't regret one minute along the way When the evening sun Starts sinking low I count my many blessings upon the road Many lay by the way side Cuz the journey is long Lost in their aching heart is desire to move on Road less traveled Jesus lead me home Good morning mule skinner I'm going to move on Mocking bird be singing That I'm not alone When I enter that city paved with gold Pearly gates going to \nopen take me to my home Sky opened up Latter rain began to fall Ushering in the crops As the willows are tall Down by the waters course Remember from where I came Dip my hat in the pool I must be on my way The Last Song Make the Mississippi run backwards Flood waters are going to crest Going to flood the old devil Can't give him no rest The devil going to be running Like a Jack Rabbit out of New Orleans High tail'n it up north That's where he outta be Got to resist his temptations Stomp him under your feet Sun is going to shine on the cotton fields The day that ol' serpent leaves Don't drink from the devils troft He's the father of lies Leaving a trail on the river banks Swore I seen mud in his eye Greater is He that is in me Than he that is in the world Who'll bell the cat A boon companion Promised a chicken in every pot Feast or famine deep six or starve Burning the candle at both ends Crossed the rubicon Nervous tic pulled at the corner of his mouth Jumping like a big mouth bass down south Chorus Light at the end of the tunnel Became a runaway train Wearing jack boots like a gestapo When it pours it rains Fall on stony ground trampled under foot The fats in the fire cats on a hot tin roof Chorus Down at the beauty parlor They gave her a permanent fit Her hair looks like something You'd pound meat with Her hub cap eyes looked at him like a t-bone Like a wild horse stampede But he had loosed his demons And his spirit been set free One Man's Opinion Lost in the Canopy of tree's he never had horse sense Oaks and Pines cap off the skies he wandered through the circus tent Before the eyes of God tried squeezing through a needles eye The world is a small place every face tells a lie He drank a gallon of embalming fluid which kept him in the stir When your full of Helium best keep your shoes on and your thoughts pure Forest is a poachers paridise and the squirrels jumping from the tree's Nose as red as a tomato livers spotted with disease The way he plays the game it's never a game of chance Took him many a year to learn this side step dance It's a nice day but that's just One Man's Opinion Nosey Parker with her little acorn going to plant a mighty oak tree in her neighbors yard Weed benders always ready to run him out on the rail But the checker players like the tales he tells They seem to want bad news and they always want more He said he'll sleep it off and in the morning shove it under the door Who walked over his tongue with their muddy shoes Bending and twisting to shake the snapping turtle loose Never met Jesus the Son of man waking up civilized In the pine cones in Birmingham Concert in the Park recorded live 8-22-96 Ain't no Devil The fellow was familiar with Bulldogs and Water hoses With coat hanger shoulders and a silver spoon in his mouth With a pocket of fools gold Ingenuity and elbow grease He got a $50 Erie Root Canal Killed the pain with a bottle dipped from the Hudson Gave his liver an eviction note With corn rolls on his head like a big black widow He rode the stick horse derby mounted on a goat Readers Digest and a T.V. guide is all the bible he ever read Captain Marvel and Wonder Women the mom and dad he never had On a dark Kentucky night about to take a bullet in the back He saw Jesus standing there by the caution sign Ain't no devil in the fiery furnace in the burning bush In the lions den pushing this pen Going to raise the dead sleeping in my bed Going to open blind eyes can satisfy At the pearly gates walking on the lake On the mountain top going to steal and rob By the river side going to baptize Going to dry those eyes ain't no devil going to crash them skies It all came crashing down timber tumbled to the ground With a tobacco tan he climbed thin air Life's too short to box with God promised he would not spare the rod Surrendered to Jesus in the back of a Corvair Ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's all I have But sometimes she makes me sad When i'm tempted by her skin I got a girl she looks so fine But she wants too much of my time When i'm tempted by her hair Chorus I love Jesus more than I love you Cause he ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's first class But sometimes she goes too fast When i'm tempted by the speed If I plant a tree If I plant a tree today I may never sit under its shade But I look at the dirt on my hands And I wonder why God made man I hold my sons in my arms Could I send them away to war I see the trust in their eyes And I wander if God cries I look up at the stars And I wonder where you are Are you looking back down at me Your as far as the eye can see It must have been some sacrifice Ask your son to give his life There is no greater love that I know Cause a father don't want to let go Bombay taxi horn Looking classy in \nhis zoot suit Passing counterfeit bills and paste Backside numb in a water

taxi horn Eyes that look into the here after Heads tilted back and noses pinched There's only two ways to come out from the front on a stretcher or stiff in a flag draped trunk He was a fugitive long shore sailor Drifting with a bald headed friend Taking the jitney down broadway Trying to hide the whiskers on his chin The motel The day was long like a servant of hell Couldn't keep the flies away sweat dripping from the window seal Someone is coveting his brother's spanish wife Better cut the barrel short and sleep with a knife There are no picket fences in this dreary town Only bad guys, dirty cops, and dice throwing blood hounds Kiss the gunners daughter I heard someone scream A radio drowned out the sounds of a melting summers dream Lemonade on ice just pour it on my brow Water

ought to do She did she did she did Whatever she thought she ought to do She did did the widow of Brid My only darling's dead, he is and all my children grown The house has emptied, all the love-birds flown In place a widow's weeds, I'll let my coal black hair grow long As glassy as a blackbird's wing, as cocky as his song She found that she could please herself, she could could the widow of Brid Swim in the sea when she felt hot Stay in bed when she did not And she began to laugh a lot She did she did she did To sing and dance and laugh a lot She did did the widow of Brid And sometimes she would drop the shopping, leave the bed unmade And sit till evening on the esplanande She'd sometimes go to church and call on Jesus by his name She fed as any blackbird would whenever hunger came She learned to play the violin she did did the widow of Brid And Saturday night in a drinking shop She jumped upon the counter top And fiddled till the dancers dropped She did she did she did Stomping upon the copper top She did did the widow of Brid And she was fond of fishing boats and all their beardy crew And partial to a salty kiss or two And some of them would gruffly whisper, \"marry me and stay\" But blackbirds do their singing from a different bush each day She had a massive motorbike she had had the widow of Brid And so she could when so she wished Ride back home early morningish With the hair in the air and smelling of fish She did she did she did And every time of a different fish She did did the widow of Brid And though she did no harm, the neighbours sniffed as neighbours do And day by day a cankerous rancour grew Many a pair of front room curtains twitched and shook with rage For she was wild as blackbirds are And they were in a cage They came and broke her window panes They did of the widow of Brid Spat upon her cycle shed Dragged her out of her Sunday bed And cropped her hair and shaved her head They chopped the hair and shaved the head They did they did they did They did of the widow of Brid And when her sobs and hiccups stopped she tidied everywhere She cleaned the shed, she swept up all the hair Some few of them came back in shame to ask her would she stay But if you ever startle blackbirds Blackbirds go away She sold up house and bought a wig A wig did the widow of Brid And unrepenting, undeterred She thundered off to cause a stir In poor old bloody
