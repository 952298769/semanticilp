decomposition of organic matter to oil occurs within the rock, forming rock with oil intermixed called mudstone Shale Oil Oil shale is a mudstone containing kerogen , a solid organic substance When heated to 800-1000 F, kerogen breaks down to form oil Problems with the process: complex process costs lots of money disposal of spent shale process requires lots of water Limit of what can be economically recovered: 25 to 35 gallons of oil per ton Potentially 2 trillion barrels of oil in shale compare to 26 billion barrels in the current US reserves Processing oil shale and tar sand Tar Sand Deposits of sand and sandstone containing very viscous heavy crude oil (known as bitumen) Mined and processed like oil shale Largest deposits in Alberta, Canada Yields about 25 gallons of oil per ton Estimated 700 billion barrels of oil can be recovered from tar sand (300 times current reserves) Use is becoming more economically viable Processing of tar sand and oil shale Processing of oil
