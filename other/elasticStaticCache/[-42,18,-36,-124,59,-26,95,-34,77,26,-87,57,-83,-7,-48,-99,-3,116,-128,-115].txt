This can be done easily using small graduated cylinders (10 ml) and an electronic balance. For example, they can pour 2 ml of coke into the graduated cylinder, place the cylinder on a balance and record the mass. (Of course, they should correct for the mass of the graduated cylinder.) This would be their first “data point”. They can repeat this technique with 4 ml, 6 ml and 8 ml of the Coke and corresponding masses for those volumes. This entire process is repeated with Diet Coke. Make sure students don’t get them mixed up. They may taste different, but they look identical in the lab.Once they have gathered their data, can find the density by one of two methods: graphing the data and finding the slope of the mass vs. volume line (most accurate), or simply finding the average density from the data points. When graphing, students should include 0,0 as a data point, since zero volume of soda has a mass of zero.The students will probably guess that the only real difference between these sodas is the sugar content. Coke contains approximately 39 grams of sugars (high fructose corn syrup and/or sucrose, which is regular old sugar) . Diet Coke contains Nutrasweet (aspartame) and since Nutrasweet is SO much sweeter than sugar, only about 100 milligrams per can are required to get it to match Coke’s level of sweetness. That’s a pretty big difference and the reason for the difference in densities of the two sodas.If you want to make it more interesting, try the new low-carb Coke, C2, and see where its density falls with respect to the other two. It contains a combination of artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose, which is Splenda) in addition to high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar. You can also try different brands. Tab contains saccharin and Diet Rite uses a combination of artificial sweeteners, giving them a slightly different density.",1.0413625240325928],["The radial arms pivoted around a small cylinder which served as the objective sight.",1.0406932830810547],["Using a Graduated Cylinder",1.034922480583191],["What is a graduated cylinder used for?",1.034922480583191],["Using a Graduated Cylinder",1.034922480583191],["What is a graduated cylinder used for?",1.034922480583191],["Using a graduated cylinder.",1.034922480583191],["Using a balance and graduated cylinder.",1.034922480583191],["use a graduated cylinder (2.)",1.034922480583191],["Use a 1000ml graduated cylinder.",1.034922480583191],["using volume in graduated cylinder",1.034922480583191],["Use a graduated cylinder if possible.",1.034922480583191],["Use a 1000ml graduated cylinder.",1.034922480583191],["Use of graduated cylinders.",1.034922480583191],["\"We are trying to see which geological tools can be used to answer the questions the archaeologists are asking,\" Maria S.
