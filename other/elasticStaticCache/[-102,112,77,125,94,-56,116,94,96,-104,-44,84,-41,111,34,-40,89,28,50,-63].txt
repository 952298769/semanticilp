The lever performs many functions in a pinball machine. The player uses the only tool accessible: a lever called the flipper. Below the playfield, the linkage moving the flipper uses the lever while the mechanics behind the flipper button switch also rely on the lever. Inclined planes create ramps. Wedges drive the ball away from pop bumpers. Wheels with axles run every motor in a machine and help rotating circles of plastic keep your score.
