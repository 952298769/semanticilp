Garth Brooks Garth Brooks Not Counting You I've Got A Good Thing Going If Tomorrow Never Comes Every Time That It Rains Alabama Clay Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old) Cowboy Bill Nobody Gets Off In This Town I Know One The Dance Not Counting You (Garth Brooks) When loving turns to parting \nI'm always the first to leave Cause when it comes to heartaches I'd rather give than to receive I've never cried myself to sleep just praying I'll get through I've never lost at love not counting you Not counting you I've never had a heartache Not counting you I never have been blue There's no exceptions to the rule I've never been nobody's fool I've never lost at love not counting you I've never got down on my knees and asked the Lord above If He would only bring to me the one I'm dreaming of Begging to be taken back and swearing I'll be true Has never crossed my mind not counting you Not counting you I've never had a heartache Not counting you I never have been blue There's no exceptions to the rule I've never been nobody's fool I've never lost at love not counting you There's no exceptions to the rule I've never been nobody's fool I've never lost at love not counting you No, I've never lost at love not counting you BACK TO THE TOP I've Got A Good Thing Going (Larry Bastian/ Mahl/ Garth Brooks) She swears there's nothing wrong, but something's missing She's never been much good at telling lies 'Cause you can hear the sound of leaving, if you listen This may be California, but Oklahoma's in her eyes I've got a good thing going It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on I've got a good thing going It's killing me that she's as good as gone By now she must be tired of always giving And tired of what she's getting in return I guess Oklahoma's more her style of living 'Cause I can see her heart is heading 'cross a bridge I thought she'd burned I've got a good thing going It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on I've got a good thing going It's killing me that she's as good as gone Lord it's killing me that she's as good as gone BACK TO THE TOP If Tomorrow Never Comes (Kim Blazy, Garth Brooks) Sometimes late at night I lie awake and watch her sleeping She's lost in peaceful dreams So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark And the thought crosses my mind If I never wake up in the morning Would she ever doubt the way I feel About her in my heart If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes 'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life Who never knew how much I loved them Now I live with the regret That my true feelings for them never were revealed So I made a promise to myself To say each day how much she means to me And avoid that circumstance Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes So tell that someone that you love Just what you're thinking of If tomorrow never comes BACK TO THE TOP Everytime That It Rains (Stefl / England / Garth Brooks) Stuck in an airport in Austin, all of the flights are delayed And as the rain keeps fllin' the mem'ries keep callin' me back To another time and place Back to a rainy dy in Oklahoma, she was workin' at this roadside cafe And it was just her and me and looked like it would be At least 'till the storm rolled away I played \"Please Come to Boston\" on the jukebox She said hey that's my favorite song The next thing I knew the song was through And we were still dancin' along And with that look in her eyes she pulled from me Then she pulled off that apron she wore And with her hand in mine we turned off the sign And locked the rain outside the door Every time that it rains I can hear her heart callin' It rains, I can see that dress fallin' The storm clouds roll on, still the memory remains Every time that it rains One late rainy night I got a phone call So I went back to see her again And through the dnce we both stumbled and with the buttons we fumbled So we decided just to call it at friends If we ever had a thing now it's over and only the memory remains Of \na roadside cafe on a September day I relive every time that it rains Every time that it rains I can hear her heart callin' It rains, I can see that dress fallin' The storm clouds roll on, still the memory remains Every time that it rains BACK TO THE TOP Alabama Clay (Larry Cordle, R. Scaife) First time he saw the ground get busted He was ten and it was 1952 His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules The farm grew to be a moneymaker And the house he lived in grew up room by room The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin' So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon His neck was red as Alabama clay But the city's call pulled him away He's got a factory job and runs a big machine He don't miss the farm or the fields of green Now the city's just a prison without fences His job is just a routine he can't stand And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands Then one day a picture came inside a letter Of a young girl with a baby in her arms And the words she wrote would change his life forever So he went to raise his family on the farm His neck is red as Alabama clay Now he's goin' home this time to stay Where the roots run deep on the family tree And the tractor rolls through the fields of green His neck is red as Alabama clay Now he's goin' home this time to stay Where the roots run deep on the family tree And the tractor rolls through the fields of green His neck is red as Alabama clay BACK TO THE TOP Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old) (R. Taylor, Garth Brooks) This ol' highway's getting longer Seems there ain't no end in sight To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night I called the house but no one answered For the last two weeks no one's been home I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see What's kept the woman holding on this long And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold I'm much too young to feel this damn old All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole I'm much too young to feel this damn old The competition's getting younger Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze Seem to be the only friends I've left at all And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold I'm much too young to feel this damn old All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole I'm much too young to feel this damn old Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old BACK TO THE TOP Cowboy Bill (Larry Bastian, E. Berghoff) He told a good story and all of us kids listened 'Bout his life on the border and the way it was then And we all believed him and when he would finish We'd ask the old cowboy to tell 'em again You could almost hear those prairie winds blowin' His saddle a creakin' 'neath his old faded jeans You could taste the dry dust from the trail he was ridin' As he sat there and painted those west Texas scenes And the grown-ups would tell us You boys keep your distance, that old man's just tellin' you lies But to all of us kids Cowboy Bill was a hero Just as true as his blue Texas skies He told of a time when he rode with the Rangers Down on the pecos and he saved the day Outnumbered by plenty, they were almost too cover With thirty banditos headed their way He looked back just in time to see a horse stumble The captain went down and Bill pulled up on his rains And through a flurry of bullets he rescued the captain And they rode for a sunset, just the story remains And the grown-ups would tell us You boys keep your distance, that old man's just tellin' you lies But to all of us kids Cowboy Bill was a hero Just as true as his blue Texas skies Well I still remember the day that it happened We waited and we waited but Bill never showed And the follks at the feed store said they hadn't seen him So we set out for his place down Old Grist Mill Road And we cried when we found him lying there with his mem'ries The old trunk wide open, things scattered about He was clutchin' a badge that said Texas Ranger And an old \"yeller\" letter said Texas Is Proud And the grown-ups that told us You boys keep your distance, that old man's just tellin' lies Well now they're \nall sayin' Cowboy Bill was a hero Just as true as his blue Texas skies Just as true as his blue Texas skies BACK TO THE TOP Nobody Gets Off in This Town (Larry Bastian, D.
