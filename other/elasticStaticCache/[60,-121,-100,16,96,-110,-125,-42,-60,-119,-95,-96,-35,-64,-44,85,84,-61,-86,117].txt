Light Reactions Most of the Energy for Life Comes from Sunlight Total rate of energy delivery from sun to earth (at the top of the atmosphere) = 175,000 terrawatts Terrawatt = 10^12 watts Rate of energy capture by plants from the sun = net primary productivity (NPP) = 100 terrawatts Only ~ 0.06% of sunlight is captured Captured in chemical bonds, especially in sugar Small amounts of energy are available to specialized microorganisms from chemical reactions not linked to sunlight It is estimated that 99% of the energy used by living cells comes from the sun Incorporation of sunlight into chemical bonds occurs through the process of photosynthesis &quot;Invented&quot; by cyanobacteria about 2 billion years ago Plants, Cyanobacteria and Algae are Autotrophs Autotrophs make their own macromolecules and do not require products from other living creatures for life Other types of organisms, including ourselves, are heterotrophs: require products from other species for energy and materials An Overview of Photosynthesis In photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water are combined, using energy from sunlight, to form glucose Oxygen is given off as a waste product This is the source of the oxygen in the atmosphere Photosynthesis has 2 sets of reactions: Light reactions split water Hydrogens are used to produce a reduced coenzyme, NADPH, and ATP Oxygen is given off Once the NADPH and ATP are formed the rest of the reactions can take place in the dark CO2 is reduced to glucose A set of cyclic reactions: the Calvin cycle Blue Light Has More Energy than Red Light Light energy has both a wave nature (like the waves seen on the surface of a pond) and a particulate nature (quanta) Travels at an enormous velocity = 186,000 miles/sec = 300,000 kilometers/sec Can travel through a vacuum Compare with sound waves: velocity ~ 0.2 miles/sec, travels only through matter Light waves have a wavelength (the distance between the same part of 2 consecutive waves) Wavelength \nis
