Seeds used for the experiment were collected randomly from more than 15 populations in September and October 2007 at Maqu station (33°45′N, 102°04′E, Maqu County, Gannan, Gansu Province, China, average altitude is over 3500 m a.s.l.). The seeds were cleaned, mixed well, and stored in paper bags in the dark at laboratory temperature. In early May 2008, the plastic pots (35 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) were filled with loam soil obtained from Hezuo station (the nutrient element contents of soil C: 0.68 ± 0.08 g/kg; N:0.27 ± 0.04 g/kg; P:0.66 ± 0.14 g/kg; PH: 6.27 ± 0.27). Each pot included 60 seeds that were buried into a depth of 1 cm. Given that L. virgaurea begins clonal growth in the second growing season (Wang et al. 2008 ), each pot had ≤5 plants (low density, ≈15/m2) and ≥35 plants (high density, ≈100/m2) at each light treatment at the beginning of the second growing season (in mid-May 2009). The densities treatment depended on the investigation of the natural population (low density, 18.33 ± 8.17/m2; high density, 75.44 ± 26.48/m2). Each treatment contained 40 pots, and they were arranged randomly at the same light condition. Pots were hand-weeded and hand-watered every year, and no fertilizer was applied throughout four growing seasons (from 2008 to 2011). Given that L. virgaurea begins sexual reproduction in the fourth growing season in this experiment, we sampled in mid-July 2011. We selected 10 pots with high density in each light condition (100% N = 405; 75% N = 416) because of the larger samples, and 40 pots with low density in each light condition (100% N = 196; 75% N = 171). We used scissors to cut the edges of pots and washed away the soil with a high-pressure jet of water. Every genet (including its ramets, rhizomes, and other structures, which we washed carefully to avoid breakage of rhizomes) was then cleaned and placed in a large envelope. Distinguishing genet and ramets is easy considering their different sizes. We measured the proportion of genets with clonal growth and sexual reproduction, number of rhizomes per genet, number of flower heads per genet, genet biomass (roots + leaves + stem), mass of clonal structures (rhizomes + ramets), mass of sexual structures (flower heads), RE of clonal growth, and sexual reproduction.",1.2260417938232422],["The experiment was designed to test the hypothesis by planting an increasing number of genus Helianthus (sunflower) seeds in pots to see how they respond to increased density in limited space.
