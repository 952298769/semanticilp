pitchfork anyways It seemed happy to be here In the brain of a cricket By moonlight the cactus and the cricket danced To the music in the desert of their dreams Instant friends they were Cactus was soft to the touch Solid and forgiving The landscape around them unfolded As they danced Neither of them noticed So intent on their odd dance Good thing no one else was wandering In the cricket's head that night The stories that cactus could tell The lizard slept on a rock in No Lizard's Land that night A gekko it was, not a gecko Related, but not the same at all He slept on the rock The glow of sunrise about to envelop him Cast a shadow on the cactus Which rested by the tiny creek That had some water trickling in it For once Crickets feared lizards I mean no one likes being eaten much But this lizard slept peacefully So peacefully that the cricket was not afraid Dance with a cactus and suddenly You think you can conquer the world The insect world, that is But the cricket felt bold today And befriended the lizard They talked and talked and talked Until talk of eating the cricket Faded into thin air The cactus watched This story unfold And thought of the stories he could tell someday If only someone would listen to a cactus The stories they would get to hear The cactus had danced with the cricket But wanted something more Out of cactus-life Not much satisfaction Sitting here all day long Occasional shutterbug passes by Capturing 'desert life' For a rock band looking for a cover For their new album But other than that Not much for a cactus To dream about But it wanted more It knew that for sure The landscape of No Lizard's Land was vivid now Sagebrush and tumbleweed Angry looking spires of rock And a cactus, a lizard, and a cricket Finding comfort in a cruel landscape Far removed from a world far crueler Than this place could ever Hope to look like The cactus watched the other two As they laughed and smiled and cried and comforted Each other with words and actions Sometimes they seemed like brothers And took turns being father and son Or teacher and pupil But in all these roles they were friends First and foremost Above everything else The cactus watched and smiled And realized that it was what the lizard and the cricket had That the cactus wanted most of all The cactus leapt with joy once When the cricket mentioned him to the lizard Who eyed the cricket warily This is my home, gekko said, no cactus in here He looked around to see and No cactus did he see A desk, yes, a box of well-worn Legos, yes But no cactus Surely, not here, he said Sadly, the cactus was still a cactus Still by the little creek Implanted in the desert sand Forever Never able to satisfy what he felt inside The feeling he got when dancing with the cricket In the cricket's mind With cricket thoughts speeding by On cricket neurons A happy memory that was But perhaps never again Thought the friendly cactus It began to think aloud Struggling with its life And why he was so unfulfilled So unhappy He cried softly When the lizard slept But at times when the two were together He couldn't help but cry then too Sure, a lizard and a cricket Are unlikely friends But I am a cactus, he thought Nobody likes a cactus Even a friendly one I have prickles and I'm mean looking And I \ncan't play with legos Or drink Mountain Dew or milk What good am I anyways What can I
