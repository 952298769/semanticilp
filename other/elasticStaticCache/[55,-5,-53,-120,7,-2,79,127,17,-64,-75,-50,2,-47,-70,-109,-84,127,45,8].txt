It was seen observing tree cavities and grasping the rim of knotholes using its tail as props and wing for balance while poking its head into the cavity. The young eagle also hangs itself upside down perhaps as an exercise in balance and was also seen doing mock attacks of inanimate objects on the ground or among tree crowns. All of these were done in the absence of the parents, which indicate that juveniles seem to learn hunting without parental intervention.",1.0635713338851929],["For example, the halteres in dipterists help balance the insect while in flight and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals.",1.0553431510925293],["For example, the halteres in flies help balance the insect while in flight, and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals, and in aggressive display.",1.0553431510925293],["For example, the halteres in flies help balance the insect while in flight, and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals, and in aggressive display.",1.0553431510925293],["For example, the halteres in dipterists help balance the insect while in flight and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals.",1.0553431510925293],["They are found behind the primary wings of insects with halteres, used as gyroscopic motion detectors and balance enhancers.",1.0553431510925293],["A balanced policy would ensure that all of these tools are used.",1.0455056428909302],["Out of the last segment of its throax (which in other insects contains a second pair of wings) develops a set rudimentry wings that act as knobby balancing organs.",1.043617606163025],["A detailed study would have to be undertaken to determine the fraction of voucher use which would have to be declared to balance the budget.",1.0315830707550049],["These properties can be observed and measured using tools such as rulers, balances, magnifiers, and thermometers.",1.0130833387374878],["Which of the following mutations is most likely to give rise to a Drosophila in which the segment that normally has halteres (short stubby wings used for balance) instead contains a second pair of full-sized wings?",1.00758957862854],["We need balance and we need to know when to use which tool most effectively.",1.00435471534729],["After the leap, \"Archaeopteryx\" would then use its wings as a balancing mechanism.",0.9974409341812134],["This can be a useful tool in encouraging the creation of detailed, balanced characters.",0.9800791144371033],["The detailed list of design requirements is a useful tool for recording, exploring and balancing these requirements.",0.9800791144371033],["use on plants to balance insect population.",0.9668052792549133],["Use on plants to balance insect population.",0.9668052792549133],["Most observers think the issue will be resolved soon, but in the meantime the Red Wings have unleashed a balanced attack that is the envy of the league.",0.9560061693191528],["Wings have arisen by different pathways in arthropods and vertebrates. In vertebrates the foreleg is modified into a wing; as a consequence the limb becomes useless or compromised for quadrupedal locomotion. Birds walk only on their hind legs. Bats use their wings as legs, while keeping their extraordinarily long fingers and extensive wing membranes folded out of the way. Arthropods have sacrificed nothing for flight; their wings evolved as completely new structures rather than as modifications of existing limbs. If one counts, insects retain three pairs of walking legs and two pairs of wings. All three pairs of legs may be used for locomotion or adapted for specialized tasks such as prey capture. Sometimes one pair of wings is modified into yet another arthropod tool while the remaining pair is used for flying. For example, beetle forewings have changed into sturdy protective coverings for the membranous hind wings. The hind wings of flies have become balancing devices necessary for their dizzying aerial maneuvers.",0.9254883527755737],["Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings being reduced to club-like balancing organs known as halteres .",0.9234251976013184]]
