(1998)) - one population, the parasite (ectoparasitic or endoparasitic) benefits by deriving nutrition at the expense of the other population, the host, which is harmed - association is specific in the case of endoparasites - some ectoparasites produce enzymes which lyse \"host\" at a distance (e.g. Cytophaga lyses algae) - some bacteria produce chitinases which lyse walls of chitin-containing fungi - parasites are usually smaller than their hosts - parasites include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa - hosts include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, cyanobacteria (e.g. effect of Bdellovibrio , an ectoparasitic bacterium, on E. coli population) - parasitic interactions provide population control mechanism - parasitism is density-dependent - parasites can thrive only as long as host population is abundant - examples: - effects of chytrids (fungal parasites) on diatom Asterionella - impact of Bdellovibrio parasitism on Escherichia coli with and without clay particles ( Figure 3.21 ) - organisms such as Bdellovibrio which is a parasite can also be attacked by other parasites such as phages - phenomenon known as hyperparasitism (see Figure 2 ) ii) PREDATION (see p. 83-85 in Atlas and Bartha (1998)) - occurs when one organisms, the predator, engulfs and then digests another organisms, the prey - predator benefits while prey is harmed - predator is usually larger than prey - interaction is of short duration - in theory, interactions of predator and prey follow regular cyclic fluctuations - predator-prey models developed - from ciliate protozoan studies with Didinium (predator) and Paramecium (prey) ( Figure 3.23 ) - involves grazing or filter-feeding - herbivores (e.g. protozoans, some phagotrophic algae) which feed on algae, cyanobacteria, and bacteria - can be non-selective feeding or selective - grazing usually non-selective - filter-feeding \nusually selective - filter feeders select for size, shape, or chemical composition - involves mechanisms to escape predation - reproduce fast - produce resistant resting stages (e.g. endospores, cysts) - form \"armour\" (e.g. spines, plates) - change shape (e.g. a protozoan ciliate) - although predation destroys individuals, the prey population may benefit from increased nutrient recycling - prey population is prevented from exhausting the carrying capacity of the environment - negative feedback mechanism involved - if either the predator or the prey were completely eliminated, the other population would also be negatively affected (e.g. experiments with Tetrahymena and Klebsiella resulted in a stable relationship reached) - predator and prey species eventually reach some degree of 'dynamic equilibrium' so that prey species is not completely eliminated (which could lead to elimination of predator
