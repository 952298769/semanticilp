blown sand or soil, work of earth-moving machinery) Sort and categorize rocks, minerals and other earth materials using one or more characteristics By the End of Grade Four Students will be able to: Use maps and globes to explain that most of the earth's surface is covered by water Identify/give examples of geological processes that have shaped New Hampshire's landscape over long periods of time Relate observed weather conditions to different climates and seasons Investigate different stages in the water cycle (melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation) By the End of Grade Six Students will be able to: Analyze rocks to obtain evidence of weathering and erosion Identify common geographic features of New Hampshire landscapes, e.g., mountains, lakes Describe basic facts about major features of the Earth's surface and natural changes in the features, e.g., volcanoes, earthquakes, glaciers Identify/give examples of geological processes that have shaped New Hampshire's landscape
