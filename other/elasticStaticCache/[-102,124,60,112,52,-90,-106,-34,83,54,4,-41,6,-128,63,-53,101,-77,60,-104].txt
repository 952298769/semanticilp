RESONATE LOVE All Rights Reserved Copyright 1997 by Mark Elsis Saviour Of Humanity What a beautiful life given us A paradise for humans to run Live forever or turn to dust Whatever happens it's what we've done And now that we have reached The time to choose our destiny Global unity I do preach Love the saviour of humanity The Rivets Are Popping 500 plus species per day Are leaving the web of life Man's extinction is on the way Cutting our own throats with a knife Like Paul Ehrlich says The rivets are popping We're like a plane in the air And each time a species goes extinct Another rivet pops from the metal One by one they pop till The plane falls apart and crashes Beauty Beauty is vanishing At an alarming rate Man is in a hurry He just can't wait The Sea Empress Let go of her oil there mate In a marine sanctuary Now isn't that great Double hulled tankers Once more too late Now the coast of Wales Is in a slippery state What we want we get That is our fate Beauty is vanishing At an alarming rate It's Over It's over It's all over The camels back Has broke Reckless man Foolish man Irreversible damage I found all around On this day to me It finally spoke Please Please understand That we must stop Our destroying ways Or we will go extinct Please understand Let go of and drop These are our last days To transform too awareness Or we will go extinct Please understand Please The Last Song Singing and singing For a mate But there are no mates To be found The last of his kind But he keeps on singing I wonder if he knows How beautiful he sings The last song Trivial Matters Wasting our time with distracting Trivial matters While our Earth is being decimated In our lifetime In front of our eyes When there is nothing more important For humanity to do Then to face this atrocity And deal with it with all our energies But no not us We'd rather be Wasting our time with distracting Trivial matters Homo Sapiens The massive Slaughter Of all life On Earth The iceberg Is now ripping The unsinkable Titanic Homo Sapiens Pissing In The Wind Propaganda Goebbels Would have been astonished of So neat and packaged now It fits just like an old glove The disorganized majority Always pissing in the wind Fragmantated filled with hatred Only to themselves they've sinned For All Life Is Interdependent First the church Then the government Now the corporation Next the cooperation Of every human on Earth For all life is interdependent Unforeseen Consequences We are way out of control With the 70,000 plus chemicals in use Our children's future we stole The legacy we leave is nothing but abuse Of ourselves and our beautiful planet Earth We do not know the unforeseen consequences Of the interaction all these chemicals together We do not know how they will affect our senses But I can tell you now it won't be for the better Distractions Keep watching those screens Filling you up with useless information There are no need for your dreams We just want a homogenous civilization Distractions everywhere you turn So you're caught up in the game Distractions maybe someday you'll learn Are only here to keep us all the same Blinded Blinded by greed Blinded by ambition Too deaf to heed A slave to submission Materialism fills your days Return on investment rules Corporations have their ways Indoctrination of the fools Don't Worry Don't worry about overpopulation Don't worry about all the pollution Don't worry about deforestation Don't worry about a sustainable solution Don't worry about global warming Don't worry about the ozone hole Don't worry about new viruses forming Don't worry about the kids future we stole Don't worry about nuclear weapons or power Don't worry about pesticides in your food Don't worry about 4000 kids starving to death each hour Don't worry about the TV being stupid and crude Don't worry about all fish stocks declining Don't worry about corrosive life killing acid rain Don't worry about the massive strip mining Don't worry about billions of slaughtered animals pain Don't worry about the 266 billion for defense Don't worry about total corporate power Don't worry about the loss of common sense Don't worry about chlorine in your shower Don't worry about grain yields diminishing Don't worry about cancer rates rising Don't worry about another species finishing Don't \nworry about your company downsizing Don't worry about recycling your trash Don't worry about genetic engineering Don't worry about it ending in a flash Don't worry about anything you're fearing Because our complete devastation of all life Is now irreversible Once Filled With Hope I try to find hope But there is none to be found It is getting harder to cope With the devastation all around I try to find hope But I'm disappointed every time I'm at the end of my rope Waiting for humanity to pay for its crime I try to find hope But it is irreversibly too late I was once filled with hope But now I know that which is to be our fate The Weight Of The World I want to see the majesty I want to sense the wonder I want to advert the tragedy I want to stop the blunder The weight of the world The time running out The hate constantly unfurled The crime of silence all about The Pervasive Charade Keep it up Prop it up Never let it fall The pervasive charade Is now spoken By all A Dead Canary In A Coal Mine Like the lemmings Marching to the sea I see all of humanity Racing to the end A dead canary In a coal mine that's me Warning us now The Earth needs to mend To Bare Witness Take a stand Show your voice Together we band For we have no choice But to bare witness To our own desolation Hoodwinked Cheated deceived swindled We've all been hoodwinked A long long time ago The democrats and republicans Devilishly sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future generations Consume Less Running from here to there And then back again and again For this that and all the other Silly useless and wasteful things We no longer are looking to share Like we did way back when Almost everyone helped one another Lost is the happiness this brings Open yourself try voluntary simplicity Learning to consume less is so freeing Show the corporations no complicity Slow down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation A masterful job where PR firms strive And a dumbing down of education Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The place media conglomerates strive And all Hollywood produces obfuscation Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The part for politicians so desperately strive A government act of incautious deliberation Tinkering With Divine Creation Playing with deadly radiation Like a bunch of babbling babies Tinkering with divine creation Never caring about all the maybes Trying to genetically engineer life While your own species goes extinct Lying to hide all inequitable strife When to Earth you are forever linked The Oligarchy Desperate ubiquitous inequalities Executed by the privileged few Horrendous nightmarish actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we act in time Restore the earth or you'll be Taken away to make it fine Distorted Views Misinformation disinformation Cover ups and lies It doesn't matter which administration They're all cut from the same pies Distorted views Slanted news It'll make you numb What right to choose You'll only lose Are the thoughts of some One Every Second They're dying of starvation One every second They're praying for salvation From the misery there born in But we turn our backs Having our own problems getting by Avoiding the horrid facts While the 3rd world babies cry Till death The Beings From Afar The beings from afar Must look at us and laugh Just babies in evolution Crawling down extinction's path John Lennon You made me write the words I do I'll even admit I idolized you Your assassination ended an era so they say But your message still lives in me each day And I'll reach the masses because I feel That certain destruction is for real If our ways don't change from what is now And stop the killing weapons we let allow Oh the hypocrisy we let go on The human civilization ends with a con With shortsighted leaders sedating us all Technology betrays with apathy we fall As Confusion Creeps In Coming down on your self As confusion creeps in Forgetting pain ruining health What is moral what is sin Each day blurs by Does anything really matter Alone sometimes I cry Wondering will tomorrow be sadder The Atomic Hump Five evolution's to get it right And here we go again Constantly in conflict and fight I think it's time to say when Enough is enough I'm bored of the game Drop the act of being tough Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end I saw a shadow Lurked in the darkness I thought security Because the article How many times I've past before Those iron gates Can I cry once more Since I was five I've heard the words Now only vinyl Is left to hear The Tears Did Shed For You Billy Will it get better Will it get worse There's rainy weather With a black hearse The tears did shed While not believing A word you said So much grieving Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn away It starts in you It starts in me Help restore our earth So future generations can be We Make Each minute that passes 100 acres of tropical forest Goes never to come back Within just one hour 4000 \nchildren starve to death While surplus crops go bad Every day that goes by There are 27 oil spills In the United States alone In one orbit around the sun More than a trillion dollars Of killing weapons we make In Order To Exist Its come so quick Its hard to tell In just a flick We've emptied the well Foresight is cheap When it's too late We're sinking in deep Still wanting the bait Computer malfunction Warning overload Drastic measures needed In order to continue We must all realize this is it We must change In order to exist As If By Divine Plan Take some time And think about this Listen real careful Cause there's no time to miss It's getting beyond reach It's gotten out of hand The power hungry preach As if by divine plan And you don't know Or just let it go by And you're always on the go But always asking why They drain your life Squeeze every last drop Tell you of freedom When looking from the top Groomed Puppets That Deceive How clever the manipulation In this land of the free How money breeds dedication In the name of liberty With political promising lies You know better than believe They're all the same you realize Groomed puppets that deceive So you give up hope Believing it will never change Apathy is how you cope Something you always found strange Without Deception The ladder of success With cut out steps Leads you nowhere Without deception Too Much Too Soon And Then Well here we are again Apathetic up till the end Too much too soon and then No recourse Take Take Take It's total chaos It's complete madness It can't go on It'll never last Take take take Until no more Is left to give Test Subjects We are the test subjects We are the dying breed We are the last checks Here to balance the greed An awaken you all So we can plant a new seed Knock down the wall That strangles you like a weed We are here to change Extinction to perpetuation Get rid of the strange Leading us to devastation It's all up to us To want a new day With us you can trust We won't lead you astray What's best for all Is the way it will be Knock down the wall For unity is the key And it won't be easy Cause they're set in their way Molded in the cast Until their dying day Which won't be long So we have no time to waste We've already been led along So now we have to haste And think for tomorrow Forget about yesterday It will only bring you sorrow And happiness is the only way Evolution's Choice Is Now Sand slipping through The hour glass Evolution's choice is now Humanity's last pass Won't wait Tomorrow's awareness In vain too late Today's judgment Decides earth's fate You've Given Up Hope You've given up hope You can't change the system Mellowing out with age You no longer try to resist them You've lost your morals They've changed your ways But deep down it eats at you They've trapped you in the maze Torn between the dream you had And the life you live Still knowing your being had But not wanting to give Inhospitable In every way possible We're destroying ourselves Making tomorrow inhospitable As long as today it sells Extinct Is Forever Man's the enemy Technology the tool Extinct is forever Don't be a fool And say it's all right Or laugh it away Stand up and fight Our numbers will say Something positive That will catch like fire An expose all the greedy Cold hearted liars To Shed Some Light I try to write About what I feel is wrong To shed some light About how we're led along In this land of the free We must be brave For our future you see A new road we must pave Playing Fate With Dice We are our own god For good or bad Our earth paradise So don't be mad In the years to come We pay the price Following blinded leaders Playing fate with dice A Merry Go Round It's just the same old game With the played out scenes A merry go round with inbetweens Lost in a fog in a sea of confusion Looking for help through realities illusion Got to break out and get away Or the conditioning ties will stay Trapping you till tomorrow's today Becomes a bitter memory of yesterday Government Sponsored There's no way out Unless you care I can scream and shout About what ain't fair But you've got to change From deep inside Brought up fast and strange Don't run and hide From the troubled day By taking drugs To escape the pain It's a cover up To keep us down Government sponsored Every pound Throw In The Towel Toxic dumps Radiation leaks Cancer lumps Mutated freaks Toxic shock Agent orange Government mock Goes on and on Nuclear waste Leukemia rate Technology haste Is our fate Love canal TMI Throw in the towel And wave good-bye Oil

up Make you give up Take Responsibility Turn away And it only gets worse Stay in the gray Until your in the hearse \nTake responsibility And it can only get better We have the ability It's just the choice of whether We take responsibility Or turn away When Humanity Wept How do you cope With global suicide How do you hope When you turn and hide What is there left For you to believe in When humanity wept Drowned in their grieving I Still Imagine In first grade My President was blown away I wondered why In fifth grade Martin and Robert were filled with lead I began to understand In the summer before high school Morrison was in French soil But no one was there I became scared For John The warmest 8th of December In New York City history I was driving my cab When Vinny broke the news From that day till now At 29 Every time I pass 1 West 72nd street I feel humanity Has no hope But I still imagine A Paradise Yours Pure There's always been war You don't learn by mistakes A paradise yours pure And only one for the takes For Tomorrow Today We're at the time When we can't look away We need a solution For tomorrow today A Handful Of Companies A handful of companies Make the

Population Visible at Great Distance fig 28.1 Population Impacts the Environment Total population of the earth in 1995 reached 5.7 billion More people consume more food, water, energy and raw materials More people create greater amount of waste A GROWING POPULATION Historical Perspective Earliest fossils from Europe are 500,000 years old Humans spread to North America 12,000 years ago Population 10,000 years ago was only 5 million With agriculture, populations rapidly expanded More dependable sources of food fig 28.2 Development of towns and cities Bubonic plague in 1348 killed nearly four-fifths of population fig 28.3 Recovery and increase to 500 million by 1650 Seventeenth century Renaissance renewed interest in science Scientific developments led to Industrial Revolution The Present Situation Global birth rate for last 300 years: 30 per year per 1000 people Present rate decreased slightly to 25 per 1000 Decreased death rate to 9 per 1000 people per year Net increase in annual population rate Population increasing \nat rate of 1.6% per year Will double population in 43 years Annual increase of 90 million per year Increase per minute of 170 people United Nation estimates population of 6 billion by 2000 AD Expected stabilization at 8.5 to 18 billion by 2090 Must stabilize population due to limited resources The Future Situation Localization of human populations in year 2000 60% in tropical or subtropical regions 20% in China 20% in developed or industrialized nations People in industrialized areas control 85% of wealth and materials Standard of living 20 times higher Lower infant mortality rate Higher life expectancy Variable world age structure affects population growth Industrialized nations: 20% of population under 15 years Developing countries have nearly twice as many fig 28.4 Populations of developing countries will continue to grow faster Industrialized nations will constitute smaller portion of the global population Quality of life dependent on stabilizing world`s population THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE Immediate World Challenge to Produce More Food Food production increased by 2.6 times since 1950 Population expanded at greater rate Most cultivatable land already in use Topsoil lost from agricultural land Consumption in developed countries increasing at greater rate Must Increase Agricultural Productivity Identify new crops, especially in tropics Major crops have been cultivated for thousands of years Few new plants cultivated since 1800 Examples: rubber and oil palms Crops selected for ease of growth Kinds of Agricultural Crops Three primary food crops: corn, wheat, rice 5000 types have ever been used for food, only 150 used regularly Various plants used for medical treatments Reasons for cultivating new plants Altered standards of cultivation Extraction of industrial products, oils, drugs, chemicals The Prospects for More Food Must increase productivity of current crops Improvement needed in tropical and subtropical regions Improvement of strains via Green Revolution: 1950-1970 Ten-fold increase in Mexican wheat production Food production in India outpaced population growth China became self-sufficient in food production Limitations of Green Revolution Agricultural techniques require great energy output Extensive use of costly pesticides and herbicides Commercial prices held low in developing areas Present solutions Improve production of current crops Not likely to bring more land into agricultural use Fully apply traditional means of plant breeding and selection fig 28.6 Include wheat, corn and rice Develop new crops in tropics and subtropics Develop improved strains via genetic engineering Resistance to specific herbicides results in better weed control Tolerance to soil conditions and mineral toxicity Ability to fix nitrogen Use of hydroponic agriculture problematic Resources of oceans are not inexhaustible Reduce over fishing of specific areas Develop new microorganism-based foods: Spirulina OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Nuclear Power Chernobyl incident One of four reactors exploded in April 1986 Emergency safety systems shut off Power surge precipitated the explosion Released over 100 megatons of radioactivity Millions of times greater than Three Mile Island Significant human exposure to radiation Death due to radiation poisoning The promise of nuclear power Fossil fuels no longer cheap sources of energy Nuclear power could provide new source Undesirable side effects to burning fossil fuels Produces sulfur and carbon dioxide New problems associated with nuclear power Safe operation of power plants Disposal of radioactive wastes Safe decommission of power plants Prevention of terrorism and sabotage Important to develop other alternative energy sources Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming CO2 in atmosphere maintains world temperature 25% higher than without it Traps heat-producing infrared light Creates greenhouse effect Associated with increased energy use Most gas from burning of fossil fuels Burning of forests also increases atmospheric gas Global warming results from increased CO2 Mean global temperature increased 1% since 1900 Masked by heat-absorbing capacity of oceans Level of CO2 could double by 2035 Warming exacerbated by trace gases Include chlorofluorocarbons Absorb infrared wavelengths better than CO2 Ancillary problems Rising sea levels Altered growth rates in plants Leads to global climate change Pollution Example: Rhine river Fire in chemical warehouse washed chemicals into river Deadly mercury and pesticides killed fish and plants Water became unsafe to drink River slowly cleaned itself The Threat of Pollution Results from industrial byproducts Plastics cannot decompose Efforts being made to develop new microorganisms yet unsuccessful Water pollution Not enough water to dispose of wastes Detergents increase algae, decrease water quality Agricultural pollution Widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers fig 28.7 Toxic chemicals remain in ecosystems Chlorinated hydrocarbons banned in U.S. Concentrate in the food chain Must develop responsible attitude toward use of chemicals Acid Precipitation Sulfur compounds produced when coal burned fig 28.8 Mixes with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid Acid dispersed by winds high up in atmosphere Effects seen far from where acids are produced Biological consequences Death of thousands of fresh water lakes fig 28.9 Seepage into groundwater Destruction of forests fig 28.10 Expensive to capture and remove emissions The Ozone Hole Visible to electronic equipment over Antarctica fig 28.11 Hole is nearly the size of the U.S. Thinning of ozone layer first appeared in 1975 Presence of hole coincides with Antarctic spring Cause of ozone hole attributed to chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) Chemicals used in cooling, fire extinguishers and styrofoam CFC`s reduce O3 ozone molecule to O2 gas Global agreements to halt CFC production Problem will get worse because of quantity currently in lower atmosphere that will reach upper atmosphere in later years Biological consequences Increased ultraviolet light penetration Increases incidence of human skin cancers Damage to photosynthetic plankton Destruction in the Tropics Traditional method of shifting agriculture fig 28.12 Crops grow for only a few years in poor soils Require decades without crops to rebuild nutrients High population density does not permit renewal No longer sufficient for even traditional manioc crop Dead materials collected for firewood, not recycled Forests being cleared at too great a rate Equal to the size of Indiana per year At the present rate they will be gone in thirty years Need to change from one-use to \ncontinuous agriculture fig 28.13 The Loss of Biodiversity Serious and rapidly accelerating problem Given the loss of species of known plants and animals Given the loss of habitat, especially in tropics Calculate loss of 20% of biodiversity within in next 30 years Loss greater considering we have named only 15% of world's eukaryotic organisms Loss important for several reasons Moral, ethical and aesthetic grounds Organisms necessary to sustain our own existence Opportunity to study them lost Also lose potential benefits of these organisms Upset balance of living communities and their physical environment Effect soils, water regulation, nutrient cycles, atmosphere and climate, absorb pollution Creating conditions of instability and unproductivity Little known about overall ecology of communities and ecosystems Cannot replace with systems that will support humans Damage is currently irreparable ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Attempts to Find Solutions to Environmental Problems Studied by

Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Ecosystems Are the Most Complex Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living Some form symbiotic relationships with plants Fix enough nitrogen to be of significance Plants can grow in soils with low amounts of nitrogen Bacteria and fungi rapidly decompose nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively insoluble and contained in only certain kinds of rocks Weather out of rocks, transported to oceans Brought up by natural uplift of land masses or by marine animals Form rich natural deposits of guano from sea birds Millions of tons of phosphates added to farm land each year Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is called superphosphate Made by treating calcium phosphate with sulfuric acid Biogeochemical Cycles Illustrated: Recycling in a Forested Ecosystem Evidence in studies of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Central stream of large temperate deciduous forest \nwatershed Measure water and nutrient flow made through concrete weirs Conclusions: undisturbed watershed efficiently retained nutrients Instructive with regard to loss of rainforest area to crops Experimental felling of trees and shrubs in one of six watersheds Amount of water runoff increased by 40% Amount of nutrients lost was greatly increased Conclusion: fertility lost, danger of flooding increased THE FLOW OF ENERGY Ecosystems Contain Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Autotrophs capture light energy and manufacture own food Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs Energy captured is slowly released through metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs, sugarcane fields = 3600 to 9100 grams/year Intertidal zone = 14,600 grams/year Trophic Levels Green plants convert 1% of the sun`s energy Less energy converted by the animals that eat plants Levels of consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids cannot be inverted ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION Succession: Ecosystems Have a Tendency to Change from Simple to Complex Cleared land becomes occupied by larger and more diverse plants Small pond becomes filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of autotrophs Organisms at later stages are more specialized than earlier organisms [Return to Chapter 26 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools

Science, EVS 1001 &quot;Race to Save the Planet&quot; QUIZ #1 (Due at the Midterm Review) A graphic representation of changes in the size of human populations over time would illustrate: linear growth the human birth rate constant growth exponential growth The two general types of pollution control are known as: linear and exponential Perpetual and exhaustible Input ant output Point and non point Renewable and nonrenewable The first law of energy (thermodynamics) applies to all forms of energy except nuclear energy applies to all forms of energy except solar power is used to predict the products of nuclear reactions says that energy quality and energy quantity are interchangeable says that energy input always equals energy output A &quot;sustainable earth&quot; society would: recycle both materials and energy efficiency rely on &quot;input&quot; methods to reduce materials waste and prevent pollution produce no waste except heat exceed the capacity of the earth to dilute waste and absorb excess heat rely only on nonpolluting solar energy The greatest diversity of animal species is found in tropical rainforests because: mammals thrive on the hot, humid climate the complex structure of the rain forest provides more niches these rainforests contain no predators the water supply in these forests is rich in nutrients both a and d are true The process whereby atmospheric nitrogen is transformed into a usable form by plants is called: solvation denitrification Rhizobium nitrolysis nitrogen fixation The carbon cycle involves: atmospheric carbon dioxide the carbon in molecules of living organisms carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water carbon in limestone all of the above The soil of tropical rainforests is generally unsuitable for agriculture because: most nutrients are in the profuse vegetation instead of the soil potassium is leached from the soil by runoff from heavy rains plant roots make it difficult to plow the soil forest plants secrete material toxic for crops more than one of the above Populations tend to be more concentrated in industrial societies because: factories need a ready nearby labor supply food supplies are greater in cities this is the most environmentally sound distribution social services are greater in cities than the countryside none of the above The trans-Alaska pipeline marked a milestone for environmental awareness because: it posed no hazards to the environment it was too far from population centers to be of environmental significance it was the first major development project for which environmental considerations were important during planning and construction no environmental impact statements were required for this project Which of the following is not one of the reasons for the Agricultural Revolution that coincided with the Industrial Revolution: development of chemical insecticides development of crop rotation deep plowing in straight rows enclosed fields instead of the use of a common area animal breeding and use of livestock for plowing Early man: had high fertility and low morality rates overstressed their environment were nomadic hunter-gathers exploited areas beyond recovery and then moved to new areas first appeared 12,000 years ago Scientist now believe that damage done to the ozone layer is caused by: increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun chlorofluorocarbos and

know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.6342105865478516],["resource

1945 in the UK we have lost 95% of flower meadows, 50% of ancient woodlands, 40% of heathlands, 50% of wet lands & 224,000 km of hedgerows all due to animal farming Pressure on land due to meat farming leads to soil erosion 6billion tons/year in the USA If everyone went vegetarian upto 90% of land used for animal farming could be taken out of production & used to replant woodlands, leisure activities etc. 25% of Central america's forests have been destroyed for cattle grazing since 1960 Between 1966-1983 38% of the Amazon rain forest was destroyed for cattle grazing 90% of cattle ranches established on cleared forest land go bankrupt in less than 8 years as the land becomes barren due to nutrient loss & overgrazing Overgrazing by cattle is destroying the land & increasing

of the rainforest by cattle farmers is destroying the lungs of the planet & reducing the worlds capacity to replenish our oxygen supply The 1,300,000,000 cattle in the world emit 60,000,000 tons of methane per year (methane is a greenhouse gas & leads to global warming) Burning of forests, grasslands & agricultural waste associated with animal farming releases 50-100,000,000 tons of methane per year Combining these figures, 25% of methane emissions are due to animal farming (not including the billions of sheep, pigs & poultry so the real figure is much higher) Fertilizer used to grow crops to feed to animals releases nitrous oxide - thought to account for 6% of the greenhouse effect Fertilizer, weedkiller & pesticides sprayed on crops enter the atmosphere creating a noxious carcinogenic

economic terms, agriculture increases the returns to land, but decreases the returns to labor In a given area, agriculture can produce more food overall, and so feed more people But they have to work harder than before to survive There is an old idea that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of civilization Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around stored food, fields, canals, etc. may need to be defended In some particularly good environments, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places agriculture, on the other hand, allows people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Less mobile mothers don't have to carry their small children constantly, encouraging them to stop breast feeding sooner this shortens the period of reduced fertility due to breast feeding Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Agriculture also provides economic incentives to have more children Farming creates a greater demand for labor, that is, kids to help with the work So farmers tend to have large families, and the population tends to grow Soon they are locked in: people can't give up farming without causing hardship or starvation because there are more people than the available land could support by foraging So the shift to farming is to some extent a one-way change there is no going back without unacceptable disaster Agriculture and sedentism have surprising effects on nutrition and health agriculture, especially in its early stages, often focuses on one or a small number of the most productive crops this results in a less varied diet than foragers eat and often poorer nutrition overall more carbohydrates lead to more dental caries (cavities), abscesses, etc. - a serious matter before modern dentistry more labor leads to more arthritis and other wear-and-tear ailments living in permanent villages creates new problems of sanitation (waste disposal, insect infestation, etc.) that encourage disease living in larger groups aids the spread of epidemic diseases ovarall, settled agricultural lifestyles typically increase biological stress on people and often decrease lifespan more children are produced, but they have a shorter life expectancy in theory, these two trends could cancel each other out but the observed pattern is that in most or all cases, the net effect is still a population increase Agriculture and sedentism have cultural effects, too: Agriculture requires investment of labor to make a plot of land productive land that has been cleared, tilled, etc. is more valuable than the rest of the countryside so people will tend to claim ownership of improved land, and become tied to it for at least a season, and often longer Sedentism allows accumulation of material goods: storage of goods and food thus the origins of rich and poor people and classes so sedentism makes economic stratification possible accumulation is not limited to a single generation, either;",0.6052694320678711],["Human population of United

Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Rainy Day Place On the many days when the weather was bad I was blessed with a treasure few have had a great chasm beneath my home where I could run, play and roam The cellar was exciting in many ways I had much fun there, I must say enjoying the games that my dog and I would play on a snow blown night or a rainy day I can not remember all of them from the days I was less than ten I do remember quite a few listen closely now, as I share them with you My friends and I played hide and seek from our hiding places we would peek so quiet, so still we all would sit until we were found by the one who was it Haunted house we would play at night after turning out each and every light the hot water tank gave off a light of blue that made this place look strange and new we would sneak around in this place so dim if someone came close we jumped out at him he would yell and jump up off the floor we all would laugh and play some more &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B.

Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My Favorite Toy An electric train, the best toy I had was mounted on wood by me and my Dad where we built the country and a town the little train went round and round we added a bridge and a tunnel too when this tunnel the train did pass through I would look into the other end at night to watch for the engine's little bright light the engine smoked, the whistle blew it had a headlight like real trains do it huffed and puffed up hill very slow then down the other side to town it would go There was a train station in the town where I would slow the train way down then I would stop it for a short time while make believe people aboard did climb I would give the whistle a toot, toot, toot it sounded like a very small flute I'd start the train on it's way down the track it traveled many miles, but it always came back &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B.

Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Root Cellar In the cellar beneath the house where I did reside over in the corner on the other side there was a place I truly loved to go it held many good things to eat, I want you to know it was a small room in the corner down there filled with many good things to eat and to share it was the root cellar with its dirt floor so neat filled with jars of my Mom's special home-made treats Vegetables and fruits in the fall we did pick Mom cooked them in our kitchen so very quick she placed then in glass jars while they were still hot by the time winter arrived, we had a lot there were many shelves on which you could find sauces and pickles of every kind jars of jams and jellies, row after row and lots of vegetables that made me grow When the wind did howl and the snow did blow down to the cellar I would go and bring up to Mom for our evening feast the best food ever, to say the least the fruits we had picked were a real prize Mom used them to bake tarts and pies when dinner was done and the table was cleared she would bring in the pie as we all cheered On your special day she would bake a cake for you she served it with candles and ice cream too real whipped cream she would pile on top I would eat so much, I just had to stop &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~10~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Missing Boy I remember when I was but four I went out through the open door to walk the distance to the store where Mom and I had gone before I knew the way past seven streets to the place where Mom got all those treats so I ventured out on my own I was four years old, thought I was grown I entered that store through the open door I remember the sound of that old wooden floor I helped myself to a pack of gum I had come here to enjoy, to have some fun I left the store through that same door I settled down on the front porch floor I stuffed in five sticks of that red gum always before, I was allowed only one I settled back to enjoy this treat when my Mother's stare my eyes did meet she jerked me up by my hand she marched me in to see the man She made me spit out that treat so good in front of the man I now stood after saying \"I'm sorry, won't do it again\" she marched me the seven streets and then she made me a harness of some old rope she scolded me and expressed the hope that I would learn from what she had done that I would remember, I was her only son she explained to me something I didn't know that all who searched thought to the lake I did go all our good neighbors searched here and there they could not find me anywhere For two long weeks when outside I could not run far enough to hide for to Mom's cloths line I stayed tied even though I yelled and cried From this I learned lessons true your parents really do love you that stealing from others is very wrong and fighting temptation makes you strong &copy; 1999 All Rights Reserved B. C. Gunton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Day At Play To sleep through the night hours seven or eight then to the sounds of morning awake to rush down the stairs, by two I leapt for there was no heat in the room where I slept to perch on a register warmed by a fire of coal to settle down with a very large bowl of hot oats covered with cream and sugar so brown a better start to the day could never be found When I was dressed and ready to play I would start out on this brand new day a new adventure I would find with my trusty dog, this pal of mine be he a lion, a horse or a bear my trusty dog was always there to fill my day in a special way he was my best friend, I must say my dog and I played fetch in the yard he was so fast, he worked so hard he protected me with a sharp eye watching closely when strangers walked by Why he loved a bath, heaven only knows he would bark and beg when I got the hose he would run round and round very fast while I sprayed him until he was soaked at last I would wash him with a bar of soap to remove all his fleas was my hope I would dry him with some old rag he'd smile at me as his tail did wag then he would shake from tail to nose and if you were the one he chose right next to you he would come and sit as \nif to ask \"that's all, that's it?\"",0.5726897716522217],["Username: Password: Post as &quot;Anonymous&quot;

Romans and others was lost The Decline of Feudalism Not known what broke isolation and integrity of feudal Europe- not a single event- not a normally disturbing war, a new tool or weapon, an invasion by tribal barbarians, or whatever May have been a series of bad crops, greater hunger, neglect of crops- something that lowered the welfare of manors Cycle of adversity- something led to the greatest mass movement in history- the First Crusade- evidence of acute social discontent emerges in 11th century, a new ideology- a spirit of asceticism- fasting, self-abasement, pilgrimages to Jerusalem, wave of salvation seeking- escape from social realities Originally, pilgrimages were by discontented feudal lords - even encouraged by Pope Urban II- get rid of discontents Some clearly made money from pilgrimages idea of freeing Holy Land from Moslem rule- would have been profitable as well Those who went with lords were not content to live as serfs again Crusades also got rid of malcontents- goal of freeing the Holy Land was a good sell Allowed new leadership to develop while lord was absent, serfs were able to assume new roles- as soldiers and in absence of the lord Many manors joined together to go on pilgrimages and later for Crusades- also mingled serfs- decried their situation Exposure to culture of Muslims also enlightening Crusading masses needed food, shelter, and roads for travel- old Roman towns revived, new trading and craft centers developed, new political units emerged, manors merged Technology, ideology began to change- at first slowly By 15th century- Florence burst-military technology, building construction, religious organization- complex marriage Great complexity, unpatterned variability, and regional character of change emerges Historical stereotyping- Renaissance, Middle Ages, Industrial Revolution- all simply labels not reality 20th century- Age of Science- but it is much more- industrialization, technology, and much more- science also goes back to the Greeks- could be media age, age of television- no one description tells story Age of Chivalry- 11 and 12th centuries- - King Arthur- lofty and honorable endeavors- rescuing ladies, jousting with equally honorable knights- few actually were knights, some off fighting Crusades, others grabbing lands, empire building Revival of Familism Family form of social organization Extended, nuclear- seems to survive change Chinese family - 2000 years, Roman- several centuries As feudal system of organization disintegrated, family survived and maintained social life, not dominant as in China, but survived Family first line of defense against change Gave individual island of stability Assumed function of procreation, physical maintenance, of socialization, of social control Comparable to frontier US- hostile forces, dependent upon own resources, and faced with constant adversity- alone one could not survive- family allowed survival Postfeudal family was patriarchal, women chattel As a form of social organization- well suited to resist change- advantage- no schools to subvert, total jurisdiction over family- born into it, spent whole of early years within it, and entirely dependent upon it during those years- provide intimacy, training, socialization- family also managed deviants Many methods to circumscribe individual- contractual marriages, controlling work, controlling experiences Freedom for women- become nun, for men, priest or soldier- family could no longer control Like women, men also bound by family- accepted mate chosen for them, worked land given to them, followed orders of elders until became elder- from teen years weighted down by responsibility for wife and children, prevented from venturing out on own Women tied to - many children, married quite young, worked with husband&#146;s family Power of dead hand of the past Organizational devices and procedures of extended family operated to preoccupy the individual and to preclude his straying from the tired and true- rituals of births, death, \nmarriages- demanding and time consuming as were family anniversaries - lots of time and money- typical wedding times ten Family tended to discourage individual mobility, keep tied to place and status Even if peasant boy left home and made fortune in town or town boy went to large city to make fortune- forced to divide it among so many relatives- hardly worth the effort- still true today in Italian villages, more one earns, more demanded- Elvis, Muhammad Ali Decline of Familism Still strong in Italy, Spain, parts of Germany, and in Scandinavia, and Hispanic cultures- was in 18th century US, dominated in South, Northern colonies, especially in New England, and still is among peasants all over the world Industrial Revolution broke extended family -modern media, technology all aided Children left home to work in factories in cities Geographic mobility probably greatest cause of breakdown of family Roman Catholic Church aided this breakdown- children could join orders, escape families- transfer filially- Church grew- so did corruption- led to Reformation Either church led to greater social advancement than did family Rise of Church aided by rise of towns and trade and new forms of social organization that made towns possible Town life did not weaken family, it offered alternatives, new and exciting lives Family no longer self-sufficient- buy bread from bakers, shoes from shoe maker, cloth from weavers, work more and more separate from family School system also separated from family Every improvement in transportation and communications weakened the family No longer rural hamlet or isolated farm A century ago- road from home two ruts though field- foot, horseback, or horse-drawn wagon- later a railroad, steamboat Few visitors, occasionally a new school teacher, priest, some drummers Weekly newspapers if at all, read Farmer&#146;s Almanac for bulletins Today, it takes minutes to get information around the world, everyone knows someone who has been to far away places, fashions no longer take years to reach people, news is immediate, hard to isolate oneself- mass processing, mass distribution, public utilities, mass television Ideological support for independence from family support slow in coming Even today typical to honor home, mother, wife, and children Life is not like that- invaded by tax collectors, countless charities, solicitors of all sorts, building inspectors, mortgage holders, children do not seem to honor parents, do not follow parent&#146;s values Idea that sons, especially extra sons, might go off for adventure emerges much later- farm to town pattern- migrant expected to return with riches or in due time to family left behind, most if left simply built near parents on farm and stayed under thumb Not until end of last century that a woman in US, Britain, Northern Europe might leave close family attachments without being suspect- normal role still that of wife, housewife, and mother- still were some independent women The Bourgeois and Other Atypical Family Systems Extended family associated with stability Nuclear family with change Yet family in less developed societies may be nuclear Clearly even extended family societies experience change Western Societies, extended family broke down as major changes occurred Reformation, development of major cities, breakup of extended families all at same time Individuals won recognition in careers etc. -where were their families?",0.5469523668289185],["Username: Password: Post as

decreases the returns to labor In a given area, agriculture can produce more food overall, and so feed more people But they have to work harder than before to survive There is an old idea that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of complex society Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around Under some circumstances, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places we will see that these special circumstances may have been keys to the initial development of agriculture in certain favored locations agriculture, on the other hand, allows and encourages people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Less mobile mothers may wean children sooner;",0.5292268991470337],["Scientists are puzzled by the healthy state of the dead

where they are located Impacts on Hinterland Creation of the hinterland disturbs natural ecosystems Farming removed native vegetation (forest cover, for example) and replaced it with selected plants

the impacts of the modern city on surrounding areas Industrial revolution increased the amount of energy required and waste generated in the city Industrial revolution was also a chemical revolution On the farm, increased use of inorganic fertilizers Loss of biodiversity with introduction of hybrid crops In industry, new chemical compounds and high concentrations placed new threats on ecosystems

export of waste) further and further away from cities Today it is very difficult to delineate an urban hinterland Consider, for example, where your next meal originated, or what materials were required to make your clothes Ecological Footprint Despite the difficulty in defining a hinterland, it is important that we be able to define the geographical impact of cities on the world In terms of land, they clearly take up little space (in the US, 75 percent of the population lives on 2 percent of the land) But the amount of land required to support a city is clearly much greater Support includes both inputs and outputs (a city could not exist unless it had somewhere to dump its garbage, for example) One way we can measure the amount of space necessary to support a city is to measure its ecological footprint Ecological Footprint The ecological footprint concept tries to measure how much nature people consume Calculates the number of acres required to support a population the ecological footprint of any defined population (from a single individual to a whole city or country) is the total area of ecologically productive land and water occupied exclusively to produce all the

Yet+it+was+always+Africans+who+captured+the+slaves,+took+them+to+the+coast+and+sold+them+to+European+traders.+The+European+forts+dotted+along+the+West+African+coast+were+built+not+for+protection+against+Africans+but+other+Europeans.+There+is+no+record+of+these+slave+forts+or+the+trading+stations+being+attacked+by+Africans,+but+they+often+changed+hands+in+wars+between+the+British,+Dutch+and+Portuguese.+The+local+Africans+who+ran+the+slave+trade+always+welcomed+them.+ African+control+of+the+trade+is+illustrated+by+the+solidarity+they+showed+when+the+European+buyers+offered+too+little.+They+simply+refused+to+sell+and+the+slave+captains+were+forced+to+sit+offshore+with+their+food+and+water+running+short+until+they+were+prepared+to+raise+their+offers.+ If+there+is+a+case+for+compensation,+the+victims+of+enslavement+must+be+the+slaves+themselves,+those+transported+to+America.+The+perpetrators+were+the+African+kingdoms,+such+as+the+Ashante+in+Ghana,+who+captured+and+sold+them.+Any+compensation,+therefore,+should+be+paid+by+West+African+ \nstates+to+African-Americans.+ Colonialism,+too,+is+problematical.+On+the+eve+of+the+100th+anniversary+of+the+Battle+of+Omdurman+in+1998,+I+asked+the+British+ambassador+to+Sudan+if+he+was+going+to+apologise.+It+was+a+particularly+vile+affair.+Thanks+to+the+Maxim+gun,+several+thousand+Sudanese+died,+but+only+a+handful+of+British+soldiers.++Of+course,++said+the+ambassador+cheerfully,++and+then+I+will+apologise+for+building+the+roads,+the+railway,+the+schools,+hospitals+and+the+university.++

It+sounds+reasonable,+but+a+closer+look,+however,+shows+that+Africa+has+already+had+a+Marshall+plan+several+times+over.+At+the+end+of+the+war+Europe+was+prostrate,+and+some+parts+faced+starvation.+America+gave+Europe+$13bn+(

in a world that was already altered by the presence of a civilization or state in this class, we will focus on what should be the simplest, cleanest cases: &quot;pristine&quot; civilizations Some states and near-states have been based on pastoralism but this seems to happen only in situations in which there are already agricultural states in neighboring areas pastoral &quot;civilizations&quot; don't seem to arise on their own Some key ideas about agriculture Agriculture provides more food per unit area of land, compared to foraging That is, you get more food per acre by farming it than by collecting the wild foods on it This allows more people to live in a given area That is, it allows a higher density of people Of course, it takes more labor to farm an acre of land than to collect the wild foods that are naturally there This process of putting in more labor per acre to get more product per acre out is called &quot;intensification&quot; agriculture is more &quot;intensive&quot; than foraging in that it produces food more per acre, but requires more labor per acre to do so agricultural practices themselves can be more or less &quot;intensive&quot; just scattering seeds or diverting floodwaters to wet some land does not take much labor, and is not a very \"intensive\" form of agriculture building and maintaining canals to irrigate the fields is more &quot;intensive&quot; than just depending on rainfall if people begin to gather and use fertilizer in order to increase yields, they are &quot;intensifying&quot; their agricultural practices because they are getting more crops per acre at the cost of collecting, hauling, and applying the fertilizer Is farming a good deal?",0.49871742725372314],["his 6266 The American Heritage Word Frequency Book

Music, P. O. Box 1590, New York NY 10028 410-558-1685 LYRICS Absolutely Baby You ask me if my love is true What I'm gonna do is prove it to you Absolutely baby, you know I'll do it for you Would I stop smoking and drinking and cussing And change all those habits that you find disgusting Absolutely baby Would I hold your bags while you shop for clothes Would I learn to dance without crushing your toes Absolutely baby Would I tell the truth babe you know I would Would I tell a lie if it made you feel good Absolutely baby I would do anything baby can't you see Because of all the good things that you do for me Absolutely baby ( return to song list ) Leave Your Dog I know that you're leaving I know our love is dying But we've been so close baby I can't keep from crying So before you cross that line Let me ask you one last time Baby would you please leave your dog We used to spend our time together Making love every night Nothing could come between us Nothing could make us fight Then we started acting crazy We made a yelling screaming mess Now you're packing your belongings I only have one request I don't want your money You know I'm not a mooch But I'll be lonely when you leave me So baby would you leave your pooch I never had a pet of any kind Till you moved in with me When you were away on business She kept me company She kept me warm in the morning She kept me running all day I can't believe you're leaving me And taking your dog away I don't want the beach house I can't keep it up But I'll be lonely when you leave me So baby would you \nleave your pup You know I'm gonna miss you darling Curling up next to me But we can't go on bitching Fighting endlessly We really tried to make it baby I'm sorry that we failed Somehow I think we could have worked it out If you had four legs and a tail I don't want half your assets I won't be a hog But I'll be lonely when you leave me So baby would you leave your dog ( return to song list ) Luray Day Sneaky summer sun is peaking through the blinds Checking our her bathing suit lines We're under the fan where breezes play On this lazy Luray day I'm counting all her freckles and as I do Her upper lip is glistening with a heavy dew Soft skin, sweet as the smell of new mown hay On this lazy Luray day Honeysuckles wilting Cicadas song is lilting The weather's right for making love and lemonade Blue bottle flies are creeping The dog and cat are sleeping We run a tub filled up with water and some ice We got it made I say I hope we never ever get AC The heat's a good excuse for kicking back you and me She sighs and fills up another ice cube tray On this lazy Luray day Ain't doin' nothin' no way On this humid hot and hazy lazy Luray Virginia day ( return to song list ) Moonlight Cruise Lost in the lights of town, we're two in a million Down by the city pier in a crowded pavilion There's a sign on the dock, a two-hour sail from the harbor Let's get away and go on a moonlight cruise Moonlight cruise on a summer night The water's calm and the stars are bright Moonlight cruise leave your day behind Take an hour to clear your mind Though it's only across the bay We'll pretend that we're far away Don't say no, baby let's just go on a moonlight cruise Two and a half miles out, the skyline is fading Leaving a golden glow, it looks like a painting The buildings and boats are lit up along the horizon We might stay out all night on the moonlight cruise ( return to song list ) By the Water Tonight let's go to a place I know Where they're just warming up at the midnight show It's by the water When you get your work done you can have a lot of fun By the water They play the best music that there ever was It's kind of hard to find but everybody does By the water If you're not feeling hot they can cure what you got By the water They play it hot and they play it live If you make some noise they'll keep playing till five By the water If you're not feeling great you can get rejuvenated By the water When the lights go down in the waterfront town The party goes all night The breeze is cool on a back bar stool The piano is shining in the burning hot spotlight The bartender knows how to be discreet She won't say who you were with last week It's by the water If your life is complicated you won't be interrogated By the water The beer is cold and the girls are fine There's no dress code and no closing time By the water You can do what you do ain't nobody watching you By the water ( return to song list ) Bonnie on a Bike Bonnie on a bike she's nice and natural She's got a smile that's smart and true Bonnie on a bike she's light and likable She's got something for you She said When I fly nobody fights with me When I sail nobody sees When I ride it's for the right reason I didn't ask to be free Bonnie on a bike can cover lots of ground Finding lonely hearts and hungry heads Bonnie on a bike got lots of customers Everybody gets fed She said When I fly nobody fights with me When I sail nobody sees When I ride its for the right reasons I didn't ask to be free Bonnie on a bike don't think it's easy now Everybody needs to make ends meet Bonnie on a bike it makes you queasy when You got nothing to eat She said When I fly nobody fights with me When I sail nobody sees When I ride it's for the right reasons I didn't ask to be free From the high-rise suite To the pushcart in the street There's a price to stay alive Everybody's selling something To survive Bonnie on the beach A change of scenery Working on a tan that's tight and smooth Bonnie on the beach Umbrellas fifty cents She's got something for you ( return to song list ) In a Dark Room He walked into a dark room Off the alley near the subway He was drawn to enter by an inner voice Everybody told him That he could not change what happened He was certain there must be another choice The storefront gypsy whispered &quot;I can see that you are troubled&quot; He said &quot;I'll do whatever it will take&quot; Tell me what you see beyond the edge Tell me what you see beyond This world I'm trapped upon I'm on the edge They sat inside a dark room With their hands placed on the table And a candle flickered shadows on the wall She closed her eyes and mumbled Incantations, pleas and questions He thought that he could hear the spirits call He sat inside a dark room In the house \nthat they had lived in And he looked up at her picture on the wall A TV psychic beckoned From a small set on the table He never thought he'd be the kind that called Help me Sister Sarah I swear I feel her presence She's following me everywhere I go ( return to song list ) Someday Raymond packed his suitcase and left it by the door He was always ready for a trip seven days before This time all his road maps couldn't show the way Through the fields and farms a million miles away As Janet tried to help him figure what to pack She just wanted to secure her soul on the luggage rack She caught his eyes in silence reaching for the door On the journey he had never made before But I think they'll be together again someday He'll be back on the tractor chewin' on some hay She'll be safe from harm on a Maryland farm every Saturday I think he's coming back this time to stay I think they'll be together again someday She remembers how she watched him drive the mountain roads To the refuge of the timbers near forgotten mother loads Sometimes she just stayed at home to keep the city near Now she swears she'd trade it all for one more year Raymond's illness took him down and Janet's tears flowed free The lawyers came, she signed her name and sold the property She told me of her dream where he was leaving for the road Without a suitcase or her hand to hold ( return to song list ) What You Got Tumbleweed played guitar on the street He drew a big crowd every night He said I really can't sing and I really can't play But I know what the people like I think it's true So I'm telling you You got to use what you got What've you got to lose, just take a shot You got to use what you got Mister Flowers worked in the warehouse He weighed about one-thirty-one But he could move a quarter-ton with a hand-truck He said &quot;I do it the easy way, son&quot; You don't have to have a rich family If you know how to make a buck You don't have to know all the answers If you know where to look them up The Bible says you get ten talents I think I got maybe two But baby take note, I 'm gonna use them both To try to do my best for you ( return to song list ) Children of Conflict Year after year the conflict went on Neighbor fought neighbor with beatings and bombs Tempers were short and memory was long Hatred like tree roots grew strong Fighting continued as peacemakers tried To find a solution and close the divide They asked each camp to send ten of their young To meet far away from the guns Children of conflict came from both sides Gathered together without knowing why Seeing the faces of those they despised And the tears in the enemy's eyes They listened in silence and stared at the floor While one girl whose brother had died in the war Talked of the life that he'd never live She would never forgive No one responded - what could be said To a child of an enemy mourning her dead Everyone there had a loved one who'd died They all broke down and cried Children of conflict came from both sides Gathered together without knowing why Seeing the sorrow that time can't erase And the tears on the enemy's face No one expects to see conflict resolved When years of destruction and hate are involved But if twenty children achieved nothing more They put faces on war Children of conflict came from both sides Gathered together without knowing why Knowing the sorrow that time can't erase And the tears on the enemy's face (

Date when his brother's girlfriend asks him to be the blind date for a pretty German girl visiting her aunt in Antwerp the words he hears are pretty and girl - at age twenty his thoughts of girls and how to meet them consume many of his waking hours only later after he has accepted this blind date his first does the girl's nationality cause him alarm anxiety intrudes into his eager expectations grows stronger as the afternoon comes to a close by early evening he is almost ready to call it off -- all afternoon he has remembered what his father has written into the family's Bible -- in memory of my dear father killed by the Germans in memory of my dear mother killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Elijahu his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Tsilia her husband and three children killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Chaim his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Hannah and her husband killed by the Germans in memory of my cousins aunts and uncles killed by the Germans his mother's family had suffered a similar fate the only survivor of the nearly hundred relatives was his father's youngest sister her husband and two sons who had survived by hiding in a cramped place too low to stand upright liberated by the Russians so weak and stooped none of them could stand up straight memories he hadn't thought about for years flood him - his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork Productions",0.46398210525512695],["they also started to make stamp seals seals are used to press an image on clay, like you do with sealing wax a glob of clay pressed over a knot or the edge of a lid and then marked with a seal can be used to close tied-up bundles, covers on jars, or even doorways, so that they can't be tampered with which is useful if you are storing valuable goods that someone or some institution owns or controls access to so, like the central storage buildings, these stamp seals suggest private property, exchange, or communal storage both the shared storage and the stamp seals suggest an increasingly complex economy Halaf style pottery became very widespread (5500 BC -

replaced by introduced grasses favored by cattle ranchers more than one of the above is true The municipal utility of Osage, Iowa, launched an ambitious energy conservation program because: the citizens of Osage had voted to rely only on local energy resources the U.S. government had announced a new policy to encourage energy efficiency nationwide the increase in oil prices in the 1970s had made providing energy services to the community much more costly the people of Osage have always prided themselves on their spirit of self-sacrifice more than one of the above is true The main reason the Volvo LCP 2000 is more efficient than present cars is: its reduced weight means that less energy is required to move it its versatile engine can run on fuels other than gasoline its seating capacity is more limited its aerodynamic design eliminates friction from the air more than one of the above is true Brazil launched its national alcohol fuels program primarily to: set an example for other developing countries create a source of liquid fuel that the country s poor could afford reduce the country s bill for imported oil reduce the country s contribution to the greenhouse effect more than one of the above is true The most valuable tool shown to get people in Osage, Iowa to conserve energy was: the high cost of electricity the installation of insulating blankets around water heaters coupled with lowering of thermostats infrared photographs of all residences showing areas of heat loss tax incentives to save energy increasing the efficiency of local industries The world s most extensive remaining fossil-fuel resource is: oil renewable biomass fuels uranium gas coal American agriculture moved to mechanized, high-input farming because: new labor-saving machines were invented implements powered by draft animals were too slow and inefficient for farming large acreages the newer methods required less human labor farmers were bribed by manufacturers of chemical fertilizers more than one of the above is true The use of chemical fertilizers poses environmental risks because: most fertilizers do not provide all the necessary plant nutrients fertilizers are not readily soluble in rainwater when washed from fields, fertilizers can lead to eutrophication of surface water fertilizers are toxic to trees and other forest plants fertilizers are too expensive for most farmers to afford The organic farm in North Dakota shown in &quot;Save the Earth Feed the World&quot; shows that: organic farming, though stable, cannot compete with conventional farms farms using low-input approaches can be productive and profitable fertilizer industry representatives are convinced by low-input methods farms using low-input approaches can be productive but not profitable only farmers who have always farmed organically are likely to succeed with low-input approaches Bukrina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, turned its food productivity around by: using modern technology developing a system of windbreaks using the \ngreen revolution developing a series of low stone checkdams for water harvesting using integrated pest management Sanitary landfills:

product income distribution depends upon the distribution of resource ownership improper channeling of resources is self-correcting income differences from differences in resource ownership are not self-correcting society can impose forced corrections: taxes, subsidies, institutional changes (4) Short-run Rationing: making supplies last Here, the economic system makes provisions for rationing commodities over the time period during which supplies cannot be changed known as \"short-run\" or \"market period\" rationing supply must be spread over consumers supply must be stretched over a time period until the next harvest (5) \nEconomic Maintenance and Growth Every economy must maintain and expand its productive capacity Maintenance : keeping the productive power operating through provisions for depreciation Expansion : continuous increase in kind and quantity of the nation s resources, together with continuous technological improvement Agricultural Economics The agricultural economist applies the analytical models of economics to agricultural problems old definition of agriculture: the science and art of farming sophisticated production techniques, products marketed all over the world agricultural inputs and storage are both now a major portion of our economy Agricultural Economics Ag economics was originally begun as a study of costs and returns for farms mainly dealt with management problems modern field is composed of specialists who study ag marketing, farm management, agricultural finance, accounting, product transportation, farm cooperatives and ag law many study more than one aspect Agricultural Economics Both major areas of economics (micro - and macro-) have applications in agriculture the problems of production on individual farms are important also, agriculture is not really independent of the other areas of the economy budgetary decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board send shock waves back through the agribusiness marketing system to every farmer Agricultural Economics The logic of economics is not the whole of agricultural economics to be effective the ag economist must also understand the biological nature of agricultural production if you study the costs of fish farming enterprises, you must also understand the technical management problems of animal husbandry the best practitioners of the art of ag economics are those who both understand theory and know how to use it in a practical setting Goal of Agriculture Economics Widely accepted goal is to increase efficiency in agriculture Basic goal is to produce the needed food and fiber without wasting resources to meet this goal, the required output must be produced with the smallest amounts of scarce resources our goal: increasing efficiency, profitability, and efficiency of resource use in all society Production Economics Production economics: the application of the principles of microeconomics in agriculture studying production principles should clarify, for the farmer, issues such as costs, output response to input and the use of resources to maximize profit/minimize costs production economics is multi-disciplinary resulted from agronomists

myself I'd still be at it tonight but sometimes mental incontinence is not a good thing I was saying things like I want a blue drink I want a green drink and the last clear memory I had was a dim voice down a long dark hall saying--don't drink that so I was being belligerent with a big guy It's the kind of thing that happens when things are not happening well and I'm the king of things that aren't happening I kind of came to when I was fucking my neighbor in the flower bed beauty strikes deep and then truth chases her naked across the street someone called the police but they said it was a domestic matter and that's what I like about New Orleans you can chase your girlfriend naked across the street and not get arrested and in the morning you can talk about it to someone who knows what you're talking about but I move in a magic circle with magic friends and I know that god has pulled us out of the hat to entertain a world full of people who don't know the trick and no matter how many steering wheels go to sleep in our arms we always wake up in our own cars in our own clothes in a city that's still on a map with a phone number and an address in our pocket we've all got powers that no one knows about and even when they're weak they work but my best days were spent in a crossfire between a coma and a photoflash long slow afternoons next to a girl with makeup on her panties and all her cruelties mysteriously spent elswhere I don't know where so don't interupt me sometimes my only goal is not to let a blackout last for more than 10 seconds and sometimes it's two days before I find out my car keys were in my shoes I'm 44 which is 17 in Yoda years It took me a long time to figure out the trick because it's not just one trick we need a suitcase of tricks to get by but it's hard to catch yourself in the middle of it that's why we try catch each other because everything has it's own velocity sometimes it's vertical and sometimes it's earth speed which is undetectable but static is like a glaze thorn in my head and sometimes waiting in a room is unforgivable and I'm tired of writing I'm bored I'm armed I don't feel like talking I've smuggled the secrets out of the bad place but I'm not sure whose side is who so I'll go down any street just see what's there because it's never a walk about what's here it's always about what's there and there's some guy talking on a cell phone with an audible dial tone and he's saying \" I'd give you a ride in my jet but it's in Columbia right now\" so maybe if he came in on a donkey with palm leaves in his beard I'd give him a free drink but that's the moment when suddenly god becomes temporary and I realize No he's not fucking with me he's just being stupid and it's my own personal Heck so maybe it's not going to be great maybe it's just gonna be crazy this way who cares so much for philosophy it's all gone soft and this's gettin too close to heaven I need to take a break I might be bitter but I'm not pissy and we're gonna keep on getting crazy VODKA, GRACE &amp; CHAKRAS I want to be the Yoda of cash --feel the money Luke I want a little vodka grace and kisses to fuel the chakras I want to see my hands when I dream I'm tired of all the cautious sorcery I want to trade in my righteousness for an ashtray or some other famous mystery apocalypse is the only game I'll play or I won't play at all it's a repetition of unpredictables a vacation from explanations just one big fat whatever designed to be erased so I called on the saint of self destruction I pushed the joy buzzer in the funhouse and got caught between floors in a chrome and glass elevator with a post-traumatic tele-pathetic tune-in turn-on \nand beam me up stomp-down king-daddy eye of god I wanted to go to Hollywood but this part of the plane doesn't go there I just want to take a gradual look at the beautiful I don't know that there's a god out there but if there is I'd appreciate her help I always imagine her to be some kind of lock-down goddess like the butter lady on the butter box I just want to get stupid up in california roll up a left-hander and revolve right back into the fucking wack-fucked primal fucking ooze no clock no phone no light until I'm done that'll put a nice little slant on your DNA --don't do it if you want to keep it but I can't hang on to everything I'll just keep it up until my ability to see patterns gets a little too amped and everything gets so omenistic I just keep thinkin' about it matter of fact I'm afraid that something paranormal could be putting its landing gear down in my naked neo-cortex even as we speak but it's not gettin' done by my head because I'm not thinking I'm not learning I'm remembering I'm enlightened but I don't know how correct I am there are maps of the enormous submerged in every moment and when they perpetrate the brilliance and I want it all to be stupid because I'm amazed by how assured everyone is such a beautiful collection of faces for each other fresh young minds in a fine young world, yeah, that'll last about half a block it's all the strangled hysterics of a culture emptied of its magic a people whose rituals no longer resonate with the unseen sleep walking in that bare oblivion something so furiously empty it's always been devouring itself a blast pit mandala in a circle of souls on an empty night that became empty afternoons again angel of oppression I know who I am I've been saved all-to-hell by a phone voice on hold and I've been looking through a window propped open with a clock ticking down to zero and I've been slamming the receiver down relentlessly tell me what's art so I can stop doing it how long will my soul have to be inside out before it can be outside in I can feel my reflection move like a secret equator around one of my immensely dangerous selves angels fly away from the blast but I can't to say which one is coming and which one is going away I got a whole precarious sartori situation goin' on I still have a language I just don't have the words and today no longer feels like any day matter of fact it doesn't feel like anything at all It feels like one of those days in between days first beginnings are always the same always in excess there isn't much more so let me go on it's 3 in the afternoon and I'm drunk as fucking mardi-gras with a bunch of strangers who love me and I'm losing my shit to a sad song on a jukebox in a bar I don't even know I'm just in it and I know that the fate that left me here will come back to pick me up this city is temptation at it's finest and sometimes you got to put a hole in the wall just to see what's going on no bad about it I've had strange environments before but I'm safe in New Orleans now just bring me presents and call me daddy because time flies when we're having fun and it stops when we say stop but time just keeps passing us by and doesn't talk to anyone and we can't say stop we can't say anything at all and time never turns off NO TITLE NO NAME \"the loneliness is sating\" -- Rilke I think too much My mind is constantly banking from thought to thought in a long graceful slur toward a more distant orbit swarming with the mystic and insane and floating among the rusted spines of angels but my mind is a beautiful engine that will always take me places even long after it breaks down there's an aloneness that comes with intelligence but it's not an emptiness it's a solitude that fills everything and there's a terror that comes with knowing but it's a terror without paranoia or conspiracy and there's the pain with great knowledge comes great pain but that great pain is constantly stretching its fingertips across the skin of great pleasure in the most beautiful and most final form of S &amp; M but those whom the gods would destroy they must first drive mad those whom they drive mad they must first haunt those whom they haunt they must first talk to and the tongues of gods speak in all things both great and small and all things count in big amounts but those who've been destroyed are no longer haunted -- to those who've been destroyed the voices simply talk and so we're left somewhere between the answers that gather and the answers that float always drifting sideways between the past stretched out into a gray light behind us and the future falling away into that invisible and uneasy space of silent and mysterious escapes but even when we release the old ghosts from old places and allow all things to be right We still slip in a thin vapor between the constellating sky and the crystallizing ground between the stars they say are above us and the so-called dirt they say is beneath us I \ndon't really know I just keep talking I don't know if I'm a guru a little down on his luck or a street clown with a limp going broke on decateur street truth is I'm probably still slipping somewhere between the two of them so maybe it's that moment between an unplanned kiss and the moment you think about it or maybe its that moment between that one thing about how you're both really different and the other thing when you're both really drunk we're nothing but mirrors of each other but until you've seen a thing empty you'll never know what it's filled with the eyes are the window of the soul if you don't see what you want in the window go inside and ask THE BOOK OF FEVERS it's 7:56 on a second floor Sunday morning in New Orleans I lean back in my chair on the balcony bottom of my feet up on the cool metal rail just cool enough to let me know I'm still alive and my body is still warm and the sun shines on the bottom of my feet just hot enough to let me know that my body has cooled down to the heat of life and not death just enough to let me know I'm back in the world of warmth and light tiny birds shadowed but not quite blue or black snap erratically through the air swinging their tiny yoyo lives around that invisible string whose other end is firmly looped around god's middle finger my left ball rolls down through the huge rip in my shorts slow and easy until it touches down on the cold metal chair and draws back up into the persistant warmth of the body skin and hair still damp and sticky from two days of fever and hallucinations unconcious and alone I peal off my shirt and let my belly buddha in the sun let the sweet beeze from the top branches in the trees lift away what's left of two days of urinous sweat five times I've had these fevers alone unconcious in a bed or on a floor for days with no one around waking thin and weak shaking like a baby and I know what the earth is doing she's been getting me ready she's preparing me to undergo a complicated alchemy where I won't have the words or hear the voices and I won't see the hands or feel the faces and she's teaching me how to die the way it's always done alone my first fever came when I was seven and when it was over my eyes were blurred hearing numbed the finger tips moved without me and after that came all the other crazy fevers fevers in flophouses and rotten rooms sweating it all out uncontrollably soaked in purities and impurities ruining sheets and beds while the real part of me abstracted itself into the world elsewhere branding my mind with visions and then there were the biochem fevers the bad acid that left me cramped and shaking fingernails cold an blue and the good acid that took me out of my mind and then took my mind out of my body and left me float on that invisible blue tether fragile as a kite in the electric current of this collosal universe where faces fade into smoke and the smoke fades into twilight and the twilight fades into deep space as the stars go out one at a time and then suddenly all at once as it all falls into the void but after I had gone there once every journey back into this world is somehow more than just being born again and somehow less because a fever is a starship that burns the spirit for fuel but God's just getting messy with me and he's made me the poster child for spirtiual birth defects freshly awakened from that burned out vision but everything that didn't quit kill me off in this world left me more insane and airborne in the next left the rest of me more alive in that unbearable grace across the street an old lady is pushing a cart of groceries her body is frail and wieghted down she stops for a moment looks up at me and we both nod to each other and when she lifts up her head her smile just floats in the air like a little girl and for a moment of no particular time or length I see her face as a young woman and the humanity of it all overwhelms me and I have the great tears inside until I feel my left ball on cold metal again and I realize my balls are still hanging out but sometimes it's like that I'm with a friend or a total stranger and we both nod at the same time about anythng or nothing at all and what it is doesn't matter it never matters all that matters is that we both wanted the other to be right at the same time everyone wants to be the exception but there are no exceptions the years go by in the billions and we don't I'm not saying this because it happens I'm saying \"this\" because many things happen and I don't want the answer I don't need to know the answer all I need is something that will make me stop asking the question GOODBYE in a goodbye to some rare blue our sleep is taken out of context floating quietly in place without us beneath our dark and silent arms any dream of knowing winds aimlessly away under the twisting stars and their alcohols aching with unfinished happinesses our eyes are \nslowly filling with a drowned light the old photographs overflow and endure the old dream of dying alone in the weather beneath the pursuing forms the moon sings lightly in a black sleepless dress as it leans against a bare woman swaying down and farther down beyond any dream of knowing just let the rain come in in between here and when we left an old photoflash will empty the heart as it shrinks back into place and the days will grow roomy which is just \"too bad\" in a long line of \"too bad\"s. issues 5 &amp; 6 home | ec chair | broken news | celine | critical

new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten to open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first \ninto the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions from a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and \npainter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later from someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in

long long time ago It was way back in`76 A friendship formed of pure innocence We first met in Mathew Street Where we heard something that would set us free A sign stands over a door it says Four lads that shook the world In the depths of those heady nights We would dream Of those bright lights Oh my friend Oh my friend Oh my friend And my friend John he went away He made some mistakes Spent time in Walton Jail And now when I see him We still talk But there`s no light shining in his eyes And Susie she was seventeen And more beauty in this world I swear you`ll never see I was gonna be king And she was gonna be queen But now all she does is Hide behind the tears If there was more sense in this world And work wasn`t so hard to find You would not be going your way I would not be going mine Oh my friend Oh my friend Oh my friend Somewhere tonight out on the streets Somewhere beneath this city`s heat In the eyes of strangers Who pass me by Well life is cruel And so unkind Oh ho The spirit of `76 And Pete has seen his dreams come true But that don`t make him no hero He`s just one of the lucky few If a man can`t change the world these days I still believe a man can change his own Destiny But the price is high that has got to be paid For everyone who survives there are many who fall I`ve seen my friends caught out in the Crossfire All their dreams and hopes smashed on the Funeral pyre I will never give in Until the day I die Get myself some independence Carve out a future with my two bare hands Oh my friend Oh my friend Oh my friend Somewhere tonight out on the streets Somewhere beneath this city`s heat In the eyes of strangers Who pass me by Well life is cruel And so unkind Oh ho The spirit of `76 Mersey lights Shine in the distance Same as they did for us then Mersey lights shine Bright in the distance Where are you know my friend You see Some nights when I can`t sleep I still think of you And all the promises All the dreams we shared I know Those lights still call to you I can hear them now I can hear them now Oooh still shining for you I`m shocked Lights are still shining Somewhere tonight out on the streets Somewhere beneath this city`s heat In the eyes of strangers Who pass me by Life is cruel And so unkind Oh ho Where`s it gone The spirit of `76 Strength (The Alarm) Give me love Give me hope Give me strenght Give me someone to live for Who will light

Presented At An Inaugural Symposium for the George Bush Presidential Library Center on Agriculture and Sustainable Development: China and Its Trading Partners January 16, 1998 Neville P. Clarke* Coordinator, The impact Assessment Group The Texas A&amp;M University System *Director Emeritus The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station The Agriculture Program The Texas A&amp;M University System Introduction Purposes of the Symposium Describe the metamorphosis occurring in China and its Pacific Rim Partners in agriculture and sustainable development Define issues and opportunities relevant to enhancing China's sustainable development: food production resource management environmental protection rural development Explore Intra and Interregional Alliance on Food, Energy, Environment, Economics and Population (FEEEP) via the Asia Pacific Economic Commission Linking China's Sustainable Development Agenda to the FEEEP Alliance Defining appropriate political goals Establishing explicit linked objectives and actions between partners Establishing relative priorities and benefits assessments Understanding interrelationships among the complex factors at play Extending or developing methods to plan and evaluate specific actions Assessing the Impact of Change: An Approach to Integrated Planning for the FEEEP Alliance Change in China's agriculture and sustainable development may be driven by: Policy or regulation Introduction of new technology or knowledge Modifications in Trade and Investment Externalities such as weather Assessing the impact of these forces which create change: Requires understanding complex, often non-obvious, interactions Links and interrelates change from the farm to global level Suggests a holistic approach involving interactive economic, environmental, and social models The Texas A&amp;M Impact Assessment Group A versatile multidimensional and holistic approach Builds on existing regional and national models and data Adaptable to multiple uses One of the implementation tools for the FEEEP Alliance A framework for implementing China's Agriculture and Sustainable Development Agenda General Conclusions and Assumptions Derived From This Symposium Overarching Principles The relationship between people, food and environment is established Linkages between local, regional, and global geographic levels are critical Economic development is a necessary priority in the \ndeveloping world Sustainable development: the longer term agenda Both common and separate agendas of the Asia Pacific Nations The Centrality of Agriculture in the China and FEEEP Agenda A major engine of economic development Consumes and replenishes natural resources Sustains and enhances the quality of life Source of renewable energy The Winds of Change for China's Agriculture and Sustainable Development Political Population Economic Environmental Food - health - well being Factors Affecting Change Policy and regulation Research and technology Trade and Investment Externalities (weather, demographic shift, e.g.) Implementing An Action Plan for Enhancing Agriculture and Sustainable Development in China and Among Its APEC Partners: Requirements for Implementation Setting the Agenda Evaluating and Prioritizing the Options for Action Defining Benefits and Determining Costs Measuring and Monitoring the Consequences of Actions Taken Facilitating Adoption and Implementation Rationale for A Georeferenced, Multidimensional, Holistic Approach to Planning and Evaluating the FEEEP Agenda Spatial Dimensions of Change for Agricultural Production and Sustainable Development Agricultural decisions and consequences are ultimately local Geographic diversity and site specificity are inherent in agricultural production Agriculture includes the range of intensive to extensive production methods Population and other Non-agricultural geographic factors often influence agricultural production locations Plans and decisions on policy target regional and national goals but have local results Regional and global agendas address common goals between and among nations THEREFORE: Enlightened decision-making requires the ability to transcend the spatial dimensions of change - to predict the impact of factors affecting change from local to global levels Spatial Dimensions of Economic Change from Agriculture Changes in productivity begin at the farm level Economic and market policy and reform exert their impact from farm level to regions/nations New technology and knowledge does not result in geographically uniform adoption and impact Supply and demand drive prices at multiple geographic levels Economically driven management decisions cause interactions between commodities in terms of quantities produced and prices across geographic regions Markets are globally interdependent THEREFORE: Models linking household, provincial, national, regional and global effects are needed to describe economic impact of forces that drive change Environmental Dimensions of Change for Agriculture and Sustainable Development Production Practices using natural resources begin at the farm/household level Geographic diversity and site specificity moderate the environmental impact of change from agriculture and forestry Air, soil, and water consequences of agriculture are often manifest across political boundaries Environmental consequences of change are often defined at the level of landscapes and watersheds Related processing and manufacturing from agricultural and forest products may originate at points, but effects are often geographically distributed THEREFORE: models are needed which project the environmental consequences of economically driven decisions at multiple geographic levels of resolution Social Dimensions of Change for Agriculture and Sustainable Development Social mores and farmer &quot;wisdom&quot; moderate the adoption of new technology and other factors creating change Risk aversion often overrides goals of enhanced productivity Short term survival at the household level often overrides longer term goals of sustainable production of food and fiber New technology and changes in policy are often not &quot;size neutral&quot; - and, &quot;one size does not fit all&quot; Agriculture and its environmental consequences are influenced by population, transportation, and availability of labor resources Factors intended to create regional or national change, such as policy and new technology, may impact people, households, and communities in non-obvious ways THEREFORE: Methods to predict and assess the social consequences of economically and socially driven change are necessary to address the sustainable development agenda at multiple levels of geographic resolution Summary: Interactions of Forces Creating Change and Their Impact on People, Food and Environment All elements of the following matrix are interactive Actions Consequences Spatial Relationships Policy or Regulation Economic Farm or Household New Technology Environmental Province or State Trade and Investment Social National or Regional Externalities Global Implications Outcomes are often complex and sometimes not obvious Interactions must be considered in predicting consequences Results pertain to public, private, and multinational investments A holistic multidimensional approach to impact assessment is necessary The Texas A&amp;M Approach: Assessing the Impact of Change Context and Rationale: Relating The Texas A&amp;M Capability to the China and FEEEP Agendas From the previous analysis it can be concluded that implementing an agenda for agriculture and sustainable development in China with linkage to the emerging FEEEP agenda requires a multidimensional georeferenced framework for strategic planning and evaluation, supported by appropriate interrelated models, data bases and analytic techniques The Texas A&amp;M methodology is being developed to meet this class of need in the context of Texas, U.S., and international scenarios The methodology is highly versatile and flexible and can serve as the needed framework The framework readily accommodates models, databases, information from multiple sources and organizes them in a georeferenced context for ready access and utilization Purpose of the Impact Assessment Group Comprehensive Capability to Assess

rolled steel from open hearths, when Gary rocked into early morning with Ivory Joe Hunter, when Gary punched out paychecks like black and white southerners had never seen in their lives, when the air raid sirens would go off every night for drills--worrying the Germans or Japs would bomb us, when the fire from the steel mills lit up the sky every night and colored it pink and gray each day, when Sarah would walk down Broadway and all the men would stop, hold their breath and stare--when Horse would take me riding on Highway 20 about 90 miles an hour, when old Griffin would put away his police badge, take few drinks at the bar then take me fishing for perch--but we'd always catch Carp and Cats--when old Smith lived down the cellar by the furnace with his gray and blue coveralls smelling like coal and sweat, always wanting to come with my dad so he could go out into Clark Woods to dig up Goldenseal and other herbs and potions so he could make his medicines, for his ladies, for his people, and Maggie, she was big and strong, but had a way and a smell like the men who chased from the time she came in until she decided who she wanted--and Ali M'Zaham, called him Ali Ceekee because he talked so much and walked like a duck, and my father, not that tall, but a man larger because he was imposing with the intensity of his look, intensity of his way, and there I was 4, maybe 5 or 6, my mother is dead so I can't resurrect the dates, and we'd go down every night, the joint was jumpin', jammed like sardines, rubbing up against and laughing with each other, music banging from the bandstand, and in the bar we had a booth where my mother would bring food for my father--he'd sit and eat, I'd drink cokes and eat Mrs. Klein's potato chips--the waitresses would come by and say &quot; looks like little Sam&quot; and &quot;when you comin' to work, rather work for you than your daddy&quot; and &quot;you looking just like yo' daddy, watch out&quot; and there was always Rosie, sometimes she'd come down from upstairs and sit with us-she worked for us at our hotel on 3rd and Jefferson--she was older than my folks, and she was like my mother's older sister, or maybe like her mother, because she knew my mother's mother had died when my mother was l2--so she had so much to learn in this strange place, this place so far from the farmlands, from the small town of Fort Dodge, Iowa, so far away from her father and her brothers and sisters, so far away on 2 lane roads that wound through small towns and took forever to travel, small towns with one gas station and a little restaurant and post-office-now she was here in the midst of this noise, fast bar, gray smoke of steel mills, a bar full of people all way from Chicago and Detroit and heavy cigarette din and music from another world, I know now that only Rosie understood how she felt, but always the people saw her innocence and ease with everyone, no one was foreign to her, no one was an enemy, she had no fear, she just drove the old truck, that red panel l935 Chevy each night, and I'd be with her, later Buddea came wrapped in baby blankets and Rosie would have to help her more and Sarah would come to say,

love--the kind of everloving, open, without reservation type of love you feel from your mother, the demanding type you feel from your father, the protective \ntype you feel from Rosie, the uncle type from old Smith and Griffin, my uncles Abudee and M'humed, and Horse would pick me up some time and put me over his head, but I knew he'd never drop me, I was his and Sarah's and my mother and dad's, and my grandfather's, he who used to come visit, with his big shoulders from digging in his garden and carrying white goods in suitcases for 8 and l0 days at a time selling to farm wives, from Iowa, and in the old days when I was 2 and 3 and we lived at the old hotel in a single room, he'd take me out in the morning, we'd stop at the store and get bananas, then we'd walk down Broadway across the bridge to the Pennsy or the B &amp; O Lines, we'd stand there, next to the huge black freight engines, or we'd go down to see the New York Central engines, sleek and silver, with big rods extending from wheel to wheel, steam hissing out of the huge barrels on the sides of the engines, the engineers leaning out with their red kerchiefs, waving to us, yelling for a banana, they always waved to us kids and we'd wave back, and we knew some of the switchers who rode in the caboose, some lived in my old man's hotel, 3rd and Jefferson--we had the hotel before we had the bar-- that's where I met Rosie, Nellie who did the cleaning, Mexican John, old Bushy, Nick of the apple cider, Wagner, who I used to think was the famous Honus Wagner who had gone to drink and was living in our hotel, Schenley who used to get drunk every night, sit on the steps of my dad's hotel and swim the Atlantic to get to England and the war, Sam Grimmit who'd argue with you from afternoon until the next morning that a Ford was better than a Chevy and he knew that from all the years of moonshine running in Tennessee, John who'd been to Hollwood and had a photo with his face like John Barrymore standing beside a Greek column shooting a bow and arrow, and William who'd been rich, a shriner/mason, lost his money,lost his wife and left his suitcases in storage at The Ambassador East and ended up living in a single room at our hotel, a man who kept the Masonic Bible in his zipped suitcase, a beautiful Bancroft bamboo tennis racquet he gave me for taking him to Chicago and waiting for him while he wore his sportcoat and nice slacks in to get his stuff from storage and to talk with the hotel people he knew, he had lost his suite or apartment at the hotel--I never understood it all, but I felt sad and told him to keep the tennis racquet, that he'd play again, he said he wouldn't, said he wished he could, said a lot of things, I can't remember them all, but I knew they were full of regrets and sorrow about his wife and his life and his drinking, but he wanted me to have the racquet because he saw the cheap racquet I had and that I couldn't play a decent game with it-and he even gave me the silk zipper cover that came with it, the type of cover they made for only the very expensive racquets in those days.",0.43937599658966064],["Index World Hunger Topsoil Depletion Rainforest

abstraction is between reality and nothingness art has a function other than function images of the past, many occupy the space of the present and future >>> DAN RAPHAEL Unpaved half moon door tangs, spheres in dead trees, translucent to hold light like a conversation happening in the back yard of 4 heads quartered and scrambled, 4 lives trying to braid who's trellis and who's vine rooted in the earth or buried there clouds flake from my chest scratching in traffic the street hulas around in glowing half circles as if time elapse pornography strips past the point of consent using reverse instead of a brake we live here we sleep here pulling the walls in like blankets-- no central heat, sun split in three tubes we hover like queenless bees addicted to gasoline: im not allowed to stay in the garage, careful not to step on hubcap sized greenhouses waiting to lift off on methane as grasses keep crashing into each other i stripe myself with the green paste, overeager chlorophyll slowly converting my skin into bark-- how a 20 foot tree can appear overnight as if dropped by winged elves spelling something only the airborne can read reversed so when giant flesh falls here the words in my rear view mirror grow tendrils, change color, i'd hear them if my radio wasnt blaring inside my solar plexus the lines in comfortable overload, a body of sound smaller than a wet suit, tighter than a wedding dress, the ability to pin memos to your chest, replacing my mouth with a faucet pipeless as remote control im drinking what the satellite offers almost choking on the labels like disposable refrigerators clicking childproof my hands a panpipe of choices... getting all my apartments on line tho located on different continents we resonate without sadness not yet bitter about not being lived in, not wanting habits to become vices avoid the censorship of remaking in the image so often sit-commed and commercialed coz no one lives that white tween the paved streets, blinded windows aglow with a rapidly shifting spectrum smoking more subtly than fireplaces i search for direct heat, the sun like a gated community, the security of void space: acres of parkinglots business parks disjointed maze-hives unsprout exurban farmlands while my own turf is abandoned fallow composting asphalt from below where the rain drips black an unbreakable plastic rivulet building the earth's resistance &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& danger warning love when i put a multi-sided wedge into the soft spot at the top of my head and someone wangs down on it with a heavy sledge into how many pieces will i split, how many places would i now be or in transition to endangered knots: a tree threaded with vines grown merged with an iron fence stamped from lava like a waffle iron or an almost metal manta-ray shotgunned with hundreds of white hot bees-- what that would sounds like at 85 miles per hour across nevada pursued by lightning bolts mutated by decades of nuclear testing a tornado in my solar plexus leave the radio off why my door has two hinges on each side-- leverage protection professional ethics or can i just make something up without accessing past lifes, my place amidst astral cartoons, time release genetic commands wafting on the parametric updraft of this world in disarray and stasis-- thin shafts of chaos occasionally bulging like after dinner pythons then to repeel an orange like seamless wrapping paper smoother than skin you cant change like clothes in a busy intersection a new building with soft doors venting an aroma array you thump it so you know its ready to eat by the \nscent you cant define pushing buttons like the sound of choppers between my legs, mountains i've not yet found split to find the crystals known by the dull gross outer, by where and how it was spawned as if one well-placed hit against something neither measured nor seen would bring light like a new universe naming the things left behind with language rolled tighter than parchment in the tube of a spine: history is in the plumbing frozen in tree scabs cause when there's so many of you trying to dance in traffic the cars get hungrier, the roads dry more quickly as if there's a difference tween hunting season and rush hour we share the traffic-copter's hallucinations, the increasingly complex exhaust whetting appetites, inverting lungs, spinning the wheel of random growth we probably wont be ready for: i cant check the map when im driving since im already on the phone to someone's voice mail saying theyve gone beyond cellular to a static positive charge i can get thru this 800 number surrendering my voice to credit's choir peeling away an orchestra to find the vibrations of a cello held against an unclad thigh, a basoon whose double reeds lubricious in the post-coital spit of a flock of vibrating lips confusing the sky so an absence of weather spawns an absence of time where hundreds of people forget their appointments and dive into the mirrors of their wallets containing their potential worth, unvisioned fantasies properly tended and blossoming in a world that values the rich expression of so many lives avoiding value, avoiding judgment, just learning to hit my bodys personal pitch hold that tone til the air runs back thru my toes and the speaker at the top of my skull, the resonating lens generating broadspectrum sweet-spots that void of amplitude that either makes some cliffside crumble or embraces in orgasm where thousands could pass out, an unintentional rapture we could become used to when more sing when more bodies join the circle of bone to light when the face in the sun is a catalogue of memory, myth and random teases across the scale of life byeond our mouths beyond many mouths a wan shadow my fingers sealing with worthless coins examined from every angle the complex stress/fate of a diamond/skull/planet gotta split gonna get hammered the new days old skin, the chants of clogging follicles there's no spot soft enough, no hammer torn apart like a spring to hold us down with pillows with spring rolls' timed release to reassemble at the core to reassert with no arms to eyes folded into triangles like a strudel swallowing itself beaten & folded & stretched, beaten & folded & stretched we cover more with less calories we drape it all with neon pasty never meant to cover, to suggest something to reveal like a mirror made of gravel, like an asphalt chakra using potholes to escape, a blemish to slow me down a scab to pick on, the way the almost melted particles dance like Mayan tech compressed, waiting to unzip in a compatible format too complex to trust too many with too much space between void is being matter is barely here what no global positioning can tell me as head is to nail, nail is to polish, to wax like a leg for a more easily developed surface using over and over tacking gravity's wind i point my toes to deny i hold my hands like spheres to be omni-directional and concealing hands hard enough to hammer with fingertip nerves sacrificed for utility what i will never feel, what i cant hear my feet saying, what can be split without revealing like water or air continuing to distribute, unaffected by whats gone thru as language changes so does genetic code long roads leading to a single present mean something lost cannot be replaced without a complex journey to lands no longer connected, lands recycled with magma and rain: the dna of the dead continues in the soil, sometimes sticking in the lungs or the throat like a world cultured from a sampling of

through unintentional and/or intentional selection the population grew and became dependent on cereals Comments: In this model, sedentism and storage come before agriculture and domestication this agrees with the archaeological evidence this process could only happen in a place that was so rich in wild cereals that sedentary life with significant storage could develop without agriculture but once the cereals were domesticated and agricultural practices were developed, agriculture could spread to other areas and have the effects discussed earlier Another proposed explanation Summary: Specialization on seasonal foods requiring rounds + drying climate-&gt; staying closer to springs-&gt; encouraging wild crops to grow near springs, increased storage-&gt; domestication, population rise, etc. i.e. driven by need to stay close to water people started as complex foragers they specialized in a few seasonal foods: cereals in spring nut-bearing trees (i.e. pistachio, almond, acorn) in fall also gazelle when they migrated past harvest times varied with elevation, so by moving up and down the mountains, foragers could stretch out food availability to cover the whole year drying climate reduced the availability of water, increasingly confining them to a limited choice of settlements near springs, making it difficult to move around to follow the wild harvest so they started encouraging cereals to grow in convenient areas near the springs, and storing the harvest for the off-season this domesticated the cereals allowed population to rise, they became dependent on agriculture, etc.... Comments: In this model, too, sedentism and storage come first, and agriculture and domestication follow as the archaeological evidence indicates and this one, too, would initially happen in a limited region, then agriculture would spread from there we will look at some of the other places where agriculture was adopted throughout the rest of the course This transition to farming made it possible

Environmental Management MANAGEMENT TERMS TERM/PHRASE CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION Active Solar Energy is the use of solar energy devices which heat water or buildings Alkaline Chlorination is a process in which an alkaline solution is added to oxide toxic chemicals such as cyanide Biological Degradation is a process in which organic compounds are decomposed into inorganic chemicals Community Forestry Schemes are forests which are planted and managed by local communities in order to provide fuel wood and help soil conservation Composting is a type of waste management which involves the degrading of of organic wastes, often producing a soil mulch Crop Rotation is a crop management technique in which different crops are grown in succession in order to maintain soil fertility Demand Side Energy Management is a use of conservation measures which counteract increases in demand for energy Detoxification is a chemical process which renders a compound no longer toxic Incineration is a technique which uses burning to dispose of refuse Intercropping is a crop management technique in which different crops are grown in alternate rows Night Soil is a term which refers to human excrement being used as fertilizer Passive Solar Energy is a design of buildings which allows for the maximum use of solar energy Recycling is a process which reuses materials that would otherwise be wasted Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) is an energy term which refers to the use of combustible materials in garbage as a source of energy Sanitary Landfill is a landfill which is engineered to prevent hazardous wastes from leaking into the environment Scrubber is a device which removes sulphur and other impurities from chimneys Sewage Effluent is a liquid waste which results after the solids have settled Shelter Belts (Wind Breaks) is a group of trees or bushes which are planted to reduce the force of winds Sludge is a solid waste which results after the removal of fluids from sewage To make a comment

held that population growth would be checked by dwindling food supplies -his principle of diminishing returns suggested that, as the population grew, more and more labor would be needed to produce each food unit (we will use another meaning of diminishing returns later) -this point of view has been expanded by the neo-Malthusians who hold that we are running out of not only food but water, air and all other resources as well -an alternative point of view says that the world is a big place full of wonderful things and that people are very clever and have done quite well thus far by coming up with better and better technology -each new wave of technology has produced a better standard of living, more people and a whole new set of problems -some people would go so far as to argue that to eliminate environmental problems, we need only eliminate environmentalists, environmental regulations, etc. -parallel to this argument is the question of whether nature is fragile or resilient -from

Wilkins Martin Wignall, normally a man of great inner strength, known among his neighborhood and his town as one of those people whose mere presence brings peace to those struggling with conflict and whose insights were universally regarded as a blessing to those given the gift of hearing them, known as a man always well-dressed and forever in perfect form, nails manicured, hair just so, conservative wire-rimmed eyeglasses always exactly in place and never prone to slip down his nose, known as the father of eight perfect little girls all ten years old and themselves always precisely poised, known as a man whose only ignominious moment had been at the age of twenty-three when, seized by a terrible impure fit of jealousy completely unlike him, he had struck with a tremendous 1948 Ford pickup truck and repeatedly backed over again and again his best friend Phil Kardass who in a moment of passion had defiled the fidelity of Martin's one true love, a strange, quiet young lady named June, June for whom the flowers would sing and whose tears over the premature death of Phil would stain the hitherto perfect pattern of Martin's soul for all eternity, Martin, known as a man who managed to fight off with remarkable persistence the unfortunately periodic urge to fondle his daughters, only slipping his hands where they didn't belong on the unusual day when his inner strength was not exactly so great as perhaps it should have been had his steeled resistance to temptation been godlike rather than merely human, though occasionally, just between you and me, those few unusual days on which he would touch his daughters would sometimes feature in Martin's behavior the extremes of human perversity to an extent that the general knowledge of his behavior would perhaps not have been quite so flattering had the story gotten out among his peers, a group of people whose tolerance of fathers fondling their little girls was, shall we say, low, lower in fact than in many small towns which already share a much higher ethical and moral standard than, say, Los Angeles, in which I dare say you could find a neighborhood in which it probably is considered, heaven forbid, almost normal to cop a feel with one's daughter once in a while, not that I'm suggesting that you move there or anything should you be inclined to such things, and certainly not that I'm suggesting that such neighborhoods should not be burned to the ground as decent men would were they marked clearly in flaming red letters on the street maps, was much surprised to find himself called upon by society as he had been, as a man of such character would have to be, especially growing up in such a town as he did in which children, except his own young girls, of course, who did not experience the benefit of their parents assiduously protecting their innocence by declining to fondle \nthem every single time the temptation arose rather than only the vast majority of the time, were sheltered from the knowledge of the big, wide adult world out there, the world which many adults would love to forget and be children again if only they did not know that they would be assaulted by that adult world in their nightmares even if spared the day-to-day exposure to horror and perversity which marks adulthood, fearing even the walk to the parking lot, as sadly many adults of today do, fearing the occasional black man who walks down the street, although God knows there are a few black men who are alright and it is the responsibility of every Christian to give the odd black man the benefit of the doubt, even if it is most likely that the black man is unemployed, living on the handouts provided by those damned bleeding- heart liberals whose high-minded ideals are bleeding our own hearts dry, or worse, that the black man is a murderer who has yet to be caught, or perhaps a murderer at heart who has yet to murder, and perhaps should be dispatched immediately to spare his victim the pain of acting out the performance which will make the black man fulfill his destiny, even though the liberal courts could not support such a thing, even if Martin Wignall, in the midst of fondling his daughters, would, yes, Martin was surprised enough that it took him uncomfortable minutes to find his bags, minutes which would have been much more difficult to spare, had he known of the surveillance, the call on the radio of the police car, the plump, balding man setting aside his jelly doughnut carefully so as not to stain his bright blue uniform shirt, his shiny badge which he loved so much, his stylish yet classic hat which sat on the seat beside him, or his beautiful, yet more classic, Beretta 9mm pistol which would come unusually handy in a very short while, to the plump man's great surprise, or had Martin even known of the call his wife had made a week before, crying in the dark, hoping that her husband would not awaken to find her out of bed, but since he knew none of these things Martin remained willing to look for the bags despite his surprise at the Lieutenant's phone call, and though the car pulled up as he started to throw his clothing, half of it dirty, into the bags, since the plump man did not run the siren Martin did not see the car and continued at a measured, methodical pace, to pack, the kind of pace at which you see paramedics work to rescue a victim, a kind of controlled rush which allows them to calmly take all the necessary steps without going so fast that they will skip the essential, for the manner in which society had expressed its needs to Martin was in the form of the Lieutenant's phone call, which stated that he was to give himself up peacefully and that a car would be dispatched to fetch him some thirty minutes hence, when in fact the car was dispatched much sooner with instructions to wait outside Martin's door to prevent his attempt to flee, as is sometimes done when kind police lieutenants wish to spare their apprehendee the embarrassment of having to prepare their personal effects with an officer watching, but usually only of course when the police lieutenant does not know about such ignominious moments as Martin's backing over Phil again and again and again to drive the image in his head of Phil and June pursuing their own ignominious moment of human joy away, as the police lieutenant presiding in Martin's town on the day of his attempted apprehension did not, \"attempted,\" I say, because as Martin heard the crack of a twig outside and peered out the window he realized the trap which had been set for him and searched for his own beloved 9mm Beretta, a tool which for moments of desperation many of those who fondle their eight daughters all the same age might very well be advised to hide away, as did Martin, posessed of the gift of foresight, but when he found the pistol he discovered it to be bereft of cartridges, a sad comment on the state of Martin's preparation considering how truly inexpensive a box of the things can be if you look in the right place, so Martin was left with no other option than to attempt to sneak out the back, an attempt in which Martin was thwarted by the simple and depressing fact that he had welded the back door shut to keep unwanted visitors away, especially during private trysts with his daughters, and having had his one option taken from him he searched his head for the option which really was no option at all, to seize his wife and hold the pistol to her head as he walked down the front steps, comically trying to carry his bags over his shoulders, a course of action which left his emotionally destroyed wife in a foggy state of psychological disrepair, as the frozen image of the bag over Martin's shoulder swinging beneath her eyes recalled to her the romantic trip, taken in younger, more carefree days, the trip on which she and Martin had fallen in love all over again for the first time since her true love Phil had been run over again and again and again by Martin's 1948 Ford pickup, and on which six of the eight daughters had been conceived, the other two daughters having been the product of two minor infidelities which were such small trifles as not to have formed a real mark on Martin's record, for even good Christians enjoy a little trifle with someone on the side, if you know what I mean, and \neven so June had forgiven Martin because on the trip she'd fallen so much in love again, and besides, it's hard to run out on the man whose virile tendencies have just been the cause of sextuplets growing within you, especially when you yourself have no real means by which to support yourself, let alone six children, but the warm memory of the trip floating through June's mind was not enough to blot out the harsh sound of a gunshot which echoed through the air or the warm feeling of blood on her shoulder from the awful gaping wound in Martin's head, for as all good Christians know an unloaded Beretta with no clip has a big hole in the handle and it can be very hard, in the haste of a difficult emotional situation, to remember to protect such a detail from an attentive police officer such as the plump man was, especially if the sugar with which the jelly doughnut was laced had heightened the officer's otherwise adrenaline-pumped senses of awareness to the point at which he would see that there were no danger to killing Martin even if there were in fact such danger, but fortunately there was not, and before Martin had even dropped to the ground unconscious the officer had shaken off his panic with the ease of the righteous killer and had reached for the jelly doughnut, which yielded up to him with just the right amount of resistance another chewy, sweet, succulent bite, ripe with the flavor of cherry, a flavor so perfect as to even overwhelm the plump man's flush of success.",0.4213486909866333],["where they intermarried with natives, white, and red,' to produce a new race: mestizo or Hispanic 5% went to north American plantations (450,000)--mostly in the South--but some to Northern USA as house servants---field slaves really had it hard--they were the ones most likely to rebel--the slaves came mostly from Gambia, Sierra Leone--the Gold Coast---from various warlike tribes that actually disliked each other as intensely as they disliked the white man who enslaved them---by early 1800s, England was protesting the slave trade as immoral---but, England never really protested as long as big money was to be made in it---by the 1820s, the American North protested the slave trade--importation of new slaves was forbidden by the Constitution in 1807 SECTION 3: AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY Until the late 18th century, life was almost predominately agricultural use of the OPEN FIELD SYSTEM--patchwork quilt design of plots usually all of the plots were planted with the same crops and harvested together (land commonly owned) commercial revolution encouraged aristocrats to compete for markets as capitalist agricultural entrepreneurs....so they ENCLOSED their lands (Enclosure Movement) ENCLOSURE-the claiming and fencing of a great amount of land--formerly common land--by the aristocrats Enclosure came around the middle of the 17th century and continued to the late 18th century About this time (18th century) Europe saw the rise of innovative farming techniques -contour farming -crop rotation -cover crops -turnips--this crop changed the health of the lower and middle class by its vitamin rich leaf and root--the root portion was used to fatten hogs--thereby producing more meat The rise of sheep farming--due to the need for wool--led to the rise of the textile industry--this enclosure movement drove many of the landless poor from \npeasant farming to becoming idle drifters--they will drift to urban areas and will later become the poor factory workers of the 19th century--Marx's downtrodden masses Parliament stopped trying to prohibit enclosure and, in fact, began requiring it with the Enclosure Acts of 1710 --- -Parliament was obviously dominated by large land owners -gone were the days commonly held land (1710) -vegetable produce shipped from area to area (short distances) became a boost to early capitalism The Introduction of maize, potatoes, turnips led to a better diet and higher birth survival The rise of the COTTAGE INDUSTRY SYSTEM-known also as the 'putting out' system--spinning wheel by the fireplace There were transportation improvements: canal systems, better bridges and highways for trade the rise of the early factory (manufactory) system came about with the use of water power and rivers SECTION 4: POPULATION PATTERNS our 17th century forebears spent most of their waking hours in an economic struggle just to stay alive SUBSISTENCE ECONOMY Famine was their worst enemy--sometimes the people had to eat grass or bark to keep from starving--yet, starve they did--especially in Ireland Crop failures occurred in Europe in 1597, 1630, 1662, 1694 DEMOGRAPHICS-the study of population trends poor harvest meant not only undernourishment, but also unemployment marriage and children might be postponed due to a poor harvest--this would lead to a population decline and a rise in disease due to poor diet the rise of the BUBONIC PLAGUE--poor hygiene led to outbreaks between 1649 and 1700 small pox (a

frequently mentioned advantages of this response to interests in preservation of agricultural land and open space were: The tax equity and free market parts of this approach are good This would help farmers compete with developers in the land market This approach addresses the root causes of loss of agricultural land The overall effect would be to strengthen the whole economy Farmers are more likely to invest in their land if they own all rights to a viable farm/have better business plans This is the choice that philosophically makes most sense/it involves less government interference A more stable agricultural economy would result in better farm business planning This avoids excessive government interference This approach may lower costs of farming Locally grown food leads to safer products for consumers This would meet the goal of nurturing rural community character and preserving scenic open space in the community The most frequently cited concerns about this approach were: There are forces in the economy that are beyond local control This approach is supposed to decrease government interference but, there is a possibility that government intervention in markets will increase This could result in more industrial agriculture This process is too slow Retail prices of agricultural goods will increase with this approach There is no way farms will compete with developers for land The following are suggestions for how this approach could be improved: Work to reduce the influence of the federal government.",0.4192892909049988],["packet turned out to be the most efficient means of delivering H&W traffic RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATION communications provided were absolutely essential, but not always the radio kind--it would have helped if more coordination and planning between Red Cross Chapters were to occur before, not during, an event pre-arrange nets before the disaster (e.g., set up nets with agencies such as hospitals, Salvation Army, etc.) RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH JAMMERS develop contingency plans to cope with frequency jammers get organized T-hunters in your area RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP OFFICIALS confusing to hams in the field to see a \"leader\" not doing leadership roles so clarify who is in charge managers need to make decisions with consultation of those in the field when ECs ask for mutual aid, they need to accept level of guidance from DEC and staff above in order to get the big picture we should accept the fact that a small number of highly trained individuals will become the teachers/leaders for the rest ECs should monitor other ECs--don't turn off your radio just because your city isn't affected identify before a disaster a list of people able to serve as supervisors or managers (they are often leadership folks, but not always)--it is necessary to rotate managers through shifts in order to avoid overtaxing any particular individual supervisors should oversee an entire operation during a particular shift--someone focusing on the overall operation can see what portion can be terminated (and how), which projects are problem areas, and ensure coordination between projects those overseeing the operation must also consult with, or be in touch with, those on the line--people working in the field are often more aware than management of issues such as under/overstaffing, equipment needs, etc., but the information provided by those working in the field must be balanced with the views of those more distant to the operation people don't have to like each other in order to work with each other--parties with disagreements should wait until after the disaster to resolve them since it is likely that the strain of being involved in the disaster is affecting their perceptions if disagreements are interfering with the running of the operation and the parties involved can not reach resolution on their own, then leadership must help them devise a solution (it may be short-term) with the good of the group or the operation in mind include more than ECs and AECs in decision making before the disaster such as OES, repeater sponsors, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE ROLE OF PACKET put out QSTs on packet about what frequencies are being used for H&W, for Resource, for Tactical, etc. put out QSTs on packet in the form of status updates hard to decipher manuals for packet during a disaster--have drills involving packet with other people's system cities need more information about our skills--statistical information desired by many cities would have been great to go via packet on a pre-set form ARES/Data would have been useful for \nkeeping track of personnel and resources set up a packet network at all EOCs, RC Chapters, and other key locations--should operate 24 hours/day network would operate with dedicated computers, software, printers, TNCs, radios, and antennas--most would have emergency power a standard needs to be written such that each location will have the same familiar equipment for ease of operation by a variety of Ops software should be written to provide printed messages automatically, w/o operator intervention when we have such a network running, we can let it run itself to a large extent, thus saving our Ops for duty on the critical voice nets much of the time and hassle of setting up and debugging a packet network would be avoided if the packet hardware was in place and ready to go at all times in an emergency, we can make good use of written message traffic in addition to the function that ARES/Data provides packet is wonderfully adapted to handling very high volumes of H&W during emergencies, but probably should be used for tactical information handling we must have more drills using packet packet has definite use in a disaster mode but we need to better determine the time that it should be put into effect there should be \"universal\" software in an AUTOEXEC.BAT file for \"idiot-proof\" setup there should be battery powered laptop computers, TNCs (TAPR II only), and transceivers (cables are essential) a perfect portable packet station will have a 12V plain-paper printer connected using standard 8.5\" x 11\" paper BB, a multiple connect bulletin board, could be used for tactical message traffic RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE USE OF REPEATERS/RADIOS we need more emergency repeaters put into the field the use of portable repeater systems would allow us to put a repeater back on the air in a shorter period of time need a back up battery at repeater sites confirm that the area where the radios are located in EOC are attached to the building's backup generator maybe have MOU with other repeater groups so other groups understand what/how we do stuff in a disaster the ability of the amateur community to respond to these events lies in separating repeater sites enough so that several might survive another quake RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH RESOURCE NET CONTROL we need to train members to keep mouth shut unless reporting serious injury after earthquake say three things at beginning of net--urge ARES members to follow city emergency plan, encourage all to go to city simplex frequency, and do damage assessment survey around your area after checking that you are safe resource net control or resource manager should give a status QST on the hour, cutting back to even numbered hours as traffic decreases--the subject is ham radio resource needs, not broadcast news imperative that a resource net is activated and that other high level repeaters should be canvassed for their availability either give Resource Net Control a back up person or designate someone else to periodically go out on various repeaters to announce resource needs and the frequency to which volunteers should tune each operation must make sure to designate a couple of hams to go out periodically on some of the repeaters to give a status update on conditions prepare a grid sheet before a disaster that enables a Resource Net Control to fill in the blanks--marked it off into time slots, with numbered blank lines on which to put names and phone numbers of the volunteers, and with space for any additional information RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH OBTAINING/DISTRIBUTING RESOURCES better coordination of housing for hams coming out of area needed may need two hams at each station--one to serve as runner and one to serve as the ham--yet some complained that two hams were overkill if hams knew where they were going, equipment needs could be defined don't \"roll over\" hams without telling resource--if hams are staying another shift, tell resource if using 220 as tactical, helpful to have resource with a 220 frequency available so novices can volunteer hams should be provided to commercial radio stations operating the Emergency Broadcast system hams should be provided to power company's corporation yard dispatch and local water company's dispatch hams should be provided to schools if the disaster strikes during class hours EC pulling telephone tree should be given specifics about what is needed in terms of resources a shadow should be dispatched to USGS to pass crucial information--may or may not be used by the cities but those in the mountains of the area are very dependent upon information concerning aftershocks, slides, etc. anytime a request is made for hams, the party accepting the request must clarify what the job entails--requesting resources means defining what is needed in terms of equipment, clothing, and time hams should be told to bring whatever is known to be required and to meet in a staging area--an on-scene coordinator will then make specific assignments during a shift after he/she sees what is available RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH USE OF TACTICAL CALLS use tactical calls and ID with ham call only when needed to fulfill license requirements RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH TERMINATION OF OPERATION need disengagement plan right after crises begins--need to plan this rather than waiting until we're tired resumption of electrical and telephone service should be one of the first factors that tell us it is time to go home RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH HANDLING TRAFFIC written traffic is quite necessary as we often deal with bureaucracies--verbal messages are sometimes ignored a very simple message form (preferably provided by the agency served) would be extremely helpful message received time is important lots of rumors going around--occasional truthful QSTs would help we need more drills involving passing traffic RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH TRAINING THE UNTRAINED the untrained can be useful but should be placed, if possible, in lower stress situations or in a \nposition where they can receive some on the job training the untrained can be used as you go along, but put only trained ARES personnel in high visibility positions establish the practice of having hams check in at a staging area for assignment and briefing prior to responding to their assignment--this provides a consistent briefing and eases the difficulty of making assignments to the many hams who responding keep with you your repeater frequencies, control codes, rosters, handbooks, up-to-date list of city simplex frequencies/hospital net frequencies, up-to-date ID cards, your city emergency plans, and maps for your area RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNED WITH TURNOVER (SHIFT CHANGE) need missing links between shift changes--need enough time for shifts to do turnover or for a supervisor to give the information out to each new shift change relief should be present at least 30 minutes before shift ends in order to do turnover rejoice!",0.41758450865745544],["Frequency Analysis of English

tears fall on fields of broken dreams And a love call is never what it seems And when you're torn down by a heart that can't be found You might be allowed to hang around Lonely Town Lonely Town Well

Merwin CHAPTER ONE CEREMONY AFTER AN AMPUTATION Spirits of the place who were here before I saw it to whom I have made such offerings as I have known how to make wanting from the first to approach you with recognition bringing for your swept ridge trees lining the wind with seedlings that have grown now to become these long wings in chorus where the birds assemble and settle their flying lives you have taught me without meaning and have lifted me up without talk or promise and again and again reappeared to me unmistakable and changing and unpronounceable as a face dust of the time a day in late spring after the silk of rain had fallen softly through the night and after the green morning the afternoon floating brushed with gold and then the sounds of machines erupting across the valley and elbowing up the slopes pushing themselves forward to occupy you to be more of you who remain the untouched silence through which they are passing I try to hear you remembering that we are not separate to find you who cannot be lost or elsewhere or incomplete nature of the solitary machine coming into the story from the minds that conceived you and the hands that first conjured up the phantom of you in fine lines on the drawing board you for whom function is all the good that exists you to whom I have come with nothing but purpose a purpose of my own as though it was something we shared you that were pried from the earth without anyone consulting you and were carried off burned beaten metamorphosed according to plans and lives to which you owed nothing let us be at peace with each other let peace be what is between us and you now single vanished part of my left hand bit of bone finger- end index who began with me in the dark that was already my mother you who touched whatever I could touch of the beginning and were how I touched and who remembered the sense of it when I thought I had forgotten it you in whom it waited under your only map of one untrodden mountain you who did as well as we could through all the hours at the piano and who helped undo the bras and found our way to the treasure and who held the fruit and the pages and knew how to button my right cuff and to wash my left ear and had taken in heart beats of birds and beloved faces and hair by day and by night fur of dogs ears of horses tongues and the latches of doors so that I still feel them clearly long after they are gone and lake water beside the boat one evening of an ancient summer and the vibration of a string over which a bow was moving as though the sound of the note were still playing and the hand of my wife found in the shallows of waking you who in a flicker of my inattention signalled to me once only my error telling me of the sudden blow from the side so that I looked down to see not you any longer but instead a mouth full of blood calling after you who had already gone gone gone ahead into what I cannot know or reach or touch leaving in your place only the cloud of pain rising into the day filling the light possessing every sound becoming the single color and taste and direction yet as the pain recedes and the moment of it you remain with me even in the missing of you small boat moving before me on the current under the daylight whatever you had touched and had known and took with you is with me now as you are when you are already there unseen part of me reminding me warning me pointing to what I cannot see never letting me forget you are my own speaking only to me going with me all \nthe rest of the way telling me what is still here THE STRANGER (After a Guarani legend recorded by Ernesto Morales) One day in the forest there was somebody who had never been there before it was somebody like the monkeys but taller and without a tail and without so much hair standing up and walking on only two feet and as he went he heard a voice calling Save me as the stranger looked he could see a snake a very big snake with a circle of fire that was dancing all around it and the snake was trying to get out but every way it turned the fire was there so the stranger bent the mink of a young tree and climbed out over the fire until he could hold a branch down to the snake and the snake wrapped himself around the branch and the stranger pulled the snake up out of the fire and as soon as the snake saw that he was free he twined himself around the stranger and started to crush the life out of him but the stranger shouted No No I am the one who has just saved your life and you pay me back by trying to kill me but the snake said I am keeping the law it is the law that whoever does good receives evil in return and he drew his coils tight around the stranger but the stranger kept on saying No No I do not believe that is the law so the snake said I will show you I will show you three times and you will see and he kept his coils tight around the stranger's neck and all around his arms and body but he let go of the stranger's legs Now walk he said to the stranger Keep going so they started out that way and they came to a river and the river said to them I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I save them from dying of thirst and all they do is stir up the mud and fill my water with dead things the snake said One the stranger said Let us go on and they did and they came to a carand&#225;-i palm there were wounds running with sap on its trunk and the palm tree was moaning I do good to everyone and look what they do to me I give them my fruit and my shade and they cut me and drink from my body until I die the snake said Two the stranger said Let us go on and they did and came to a place where they heard whimpering and saw a dog with his paw in a basket and the dog said I did a good thing and this is what came of it I found a jaguar who had been hurt and I took care of him and he got better and as soon as he had his strength again he sprang at me wanting to eat me up I managed to get away but he tore my paw I hid in a cave until he was gone and here in this basket I have a calabash full of milk for my wound but now I have pushed it too far down to reach will you help me he said to the snake and the snake liked milk better than anything so he slid off the stranger and into the basket and when he was inside the dog snapped it shut and swung it against a tree with all his might again and again until the snake was dead and after the snake was dead in there the dog said to the stranger Friend I have saved your life and the stranger took the dog home with him and treated him the way the stranger would treat a dog THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES At what moment can it be said to occur the grand stillness of this symmetry whose horizons become the horizon and whose designer's name seems to be Ours even when the designer has long since vanished and the king his master whom they called The Sun in his day is nobody again here are the avenues of light reflected and magnified and here the form's vast claim to have been true forever as the law of a universe in which nothing appears to change and there was nothing before this except defects of Nature and a waste of marshes a lake a chaos of birds and wild things a river making its undirected way it was always the water that was motion even while thirty six thousand men and six thousand horses for more than three decades diverted it into a thousand fountains and when all those men and horses had gone the water flowed on and the sound of water falling echoes in the dream the dream of water in which the avenues all of them are the river on its own way CHORUS The wet bamboo clacking in the night rain crying in the darkness whimpering softly as the hollow columns touch and slide along each other swaying with the empty air these are sounds from before there were voices gestures older than grief from before there was pain as we know it the impossibly tall stems are reaching out groping and waving before longing as we think of it or loss as we are acquainted with it or feelings able to recognize the syllables that might be their own calling out to them like names in the dark telling them nothing about loss or about longing nothing ever about all that has yet to answer WHAT IS A GARDEN All day working happily down near the stream bed the light passing into the remote opalescence it \nreturns to as the year wakes toward winter a season of rain in a year already rich in rain with masked light emerging on all sides in the new leaves of the palms quietly waving time of mud and slipping and of overhearing the water under the sloped ground going on whispering as it travels time of rain thundering at night and of rocks rolling and echoing in the torrent and of looking up after noon through the high branches to see fine rain drifting across the sunlight over the valley that was abused and at last left to fill with thickets of rampant aliens bringing habits but no stories under the mango trees already vast as clouds there I keep discovering beneath the tangle the ancient shaping of water to which the light of an hour comes back as to a secret and there I planted young palms in places I had not pondered until then I imagined their roots setting out in the dark knowing without knowledge I kept trying to see them standing in that bend of the valley in the light that would come A NIGHT FRAGRANCE Now I am old enough to remember people speaking of immortality as though it were something known to exist a tangible substance that might be acquired to be used perhaps in the kitchen every day in whatever was made there forever after and they applied the word to literature and the names of things names of persons and the naming of other things for them and no doubt they repeated that word with some element of belief when they named a genus of somewhat more than a hundred species of tropical trees and shrubs some with flowers most fragrant at night for James Theodore Tabernaemontanus of Heidelberg physician and botanist highly regarded in his day over four centuries ago immortality might be like that with the scattered species continuing their various evolutions the flowers opening by day or night with no knowledge of bearing a name of anyone and their fragrance if it reminds at all not reminding of him By W.S.

moving alone moving in slow motion moving into speeches into experimental phonetics moving from thoughts of ancient traditional practices to thoughts of the globalization of capital from ritual food for the spirits to industrial waste products, from sound bites to long protests shouts from sexual taboos to unveilings from self-awareness embedded in tattoos around lips to computer chips from definitions caked under fingernails to the satellite scanning of surfaces for resources from Jali praise poems to roots of the blues from oral text to written text from writer to writer talking and reading and chanting and dubbing and turning in circles and saying things like: we have to link struggles we are making the future today we stretched the words, we slashed the words, we changed the spelling I want to claim my identity I write to recollect I write to fight against the legacy of oppression I try to work with the magic of words I had to be all in one flesh, a revolutionary force that needed nothing else to survive and we do have to stop policing ourselves this is a great time to be alive the cross-generational dialogue is very important there is a strong and persistent relationship between the poet and music in order to reach into the hearts of the people you use their proverbs, their ways of expressing I try to relay the poetics of the Creole language yes I get kind of worried if a Black woman gets up on stage and the first thing she says is &quot;I m a Black woman&quot; we are all starting to get our information from the same sources I m very obsessed with the ongoing influence of the photograph of Emmitt Till I m really interested in the prison-industrial complex I m here to break new ground the oral stories taught me to love Jamaican patois the thing that continues to drive me is the struggle with language you think in your own language and you want to put it in a foreign language and somewhere in between something is lost if you don t read you cannot be a filmmaker you cannot be a painter you are nothing what language do we dream in what is our responsibility to immigrants from third world countries we are all recolonized once dehumanized women can be killed routinely I don t want to just hear the I-have-a-big-baby-I-have-a-big-butt-I-have-a- penis-and-a-gun drive-by stories if you don t exist how can you speak you can be censored at every level our bodies have become the terrain for resolving bitter conflicts all over the globe in 1994 you had women assassinated because they did not wear the veil the conglomerates don t really have our best interest at heart how does one return to the site of that space that caused pain and turn it around I am very preoccupied with the ordinary eruptive volcanic intelligence of African American people what s new in poetry what s new in fiction no freedom no development find your voice and use it That was the message the points of departure the freedom of expression the sound of the planet in the women s sphere of communication the imaginative literary political thinking the imperative mood the beautiful moment of human creativity and creative diversity of literature art and international relationships of encounters like seeing Locadia Ndandarika walking across Washington Square Park with a large box of her stone sculpture on her head like seeing Lindiwe Mabuza and seeing how her personal experience and her collective experience came together through higher education, through exile through activism through literature and how that package is a part of her political job as a diplomat like listening to Alexis De Veaux and remembering her as a young poet and journalist and now watching her speak as a grown woman a professional experienced writer teacher and brilliant thinker and then there were Ekiuwa Inneh, Buchi Emecheta, and Tess Onwueme three women from the center of Nigeria who were once young Nigerian school girls evolving through Western and Nigerian education and now we see the result one working and progressing at home in Benin City one working and progressing and jet-setting in and out of London and one working and progressing and heading a department at a university in the U.S. and these encounters were doubling up in triple time like the dance steps of Wunmi Olaiya Yes literary mothers and mothers of literature telling their stories and searching for answers to some of the main questions of the conference that is how can Black women writers raise the level of their work, achieve economic independence, and control their own images how can they develop publishing outlets and effective means of distribution Yari Yari gave space \nto these voices and allowed all aspects of literature to be emphasized it also helped to close the generational gap and the gap between what the writer writes and what the public understands Yari Yari was meant to encourage young people who are interested in writing to give support to those efforts to help young women think of education and writing and aid young writers who need corroboration and confidence The struggle to become a writer and to be known as a writer and respected as a writer is not easy To organize a Yari Yari conference is not easy there are connections and misconnections circumstances under control and beyond control listening to reactions like why was the official greeter not at the airport no taxi cabs at night in the Wall Street area I didn t know the Yari Yari airport van was in an accident no transportation where are we supposed to eat there are not enough lesbians represented here we need more translators there should be more young writers on the panels why are you doing a conference on just Black women writers where are the welfare mothers where are the ex-prisoners people can t afford to come to this conference why weren t my friends invited to participate why didn t I get an invitation to the awards dinner I m not supposed to be here I wasn t invited I can t make every panel, every film, it s too much, etc. Yari Yari a very full very successful very important international event Yari Yari which means the future of the future in the Kuranko

literature, biographies, autobiographies, the visual-verbal connection We started with a dinner on West End Avenue and ended with breakfast five blocks from the African Burial Ground And Yari Yari was

function as a variable input outside the control of the farmer a change in the weather may shift the function up or down Perfect Certainty Summary: Management decisions based on production functions can only be as accurate as the production functions themselves care must be given to select the appropriate production function select the right one or suffer the consequences for this class, we will assume that the pond farmer knows the outcome of the production process from the beginning (perfect certainty) Perfect Certainty Definition : knowing the outcome in advance examples: knowing the corn yields at various levels of fertilization, knowing pond yields at a certain protein level of feed on top of this, he/she also knows the cost of fertilizer, the cost of feed, and the price that the shrimp will bring Assumption 2: level of technology If you produce, it is assumed that you do it via a certain methodology or process unfortunately, a product can be produced in many ways we normally assume in production economics that the manager uses the most up-to-date technology it is the process that yields the most output from a given amount of input Assumption 3: length of time period The production function shows output at various levels of input over a specific length of time these resources can be either of a fixed or variable nature reasons for fixing a variable: 1) maybe the amount used is just the right amount, any more or less would lower profits 2) maybe the production time period is too short to change the amount of resource on hand (e.g., land) Assumption 3: length of time period 3) the farmer just may not want to change the amount of resource (e.g., not changing the number of dairy cattle in order to evaluate a feed effect) in the long run, the manager has the opportunity to change the level of usage of all inputs in the short run, he/she may not change this Assumption 3: length of time period Different Time Periods Studied 1) very short run: so short all resources are fixed 2) short run: length allows at least one resource to be varied (all others fixed) 3) long run: any and all resources can be varied this classification of time is often not satisfactory simply because the long run does no allow for adequate mgmt on the part of the farmer often the case is that the farmer is jumping from one short run to another and is always faced with some fixed inputs Assumption 3: Length of Time Period In the real world, the farmer is seldom thinking about whether he/she has a long run or short run production process he/she sizes up the farm business, decides which inputs should be increased or decreased and makes appropriate changes during the time he/she is trying to make a decision over buying another input (e.g., tractor) the number of tractors are fixed on the farm Back to the Classical Production Function There are several classical production function for various agricultural situations a discussion of all the production functions that now exist in agriculture would involve more space than any book could provide few are reported for aquaculture it would be impossible to record them all as they happen we are simply trying to gain a better understanding of input-output relations the result is general guidelines and indications useful to farm managers Back to the Classical Production Function The shape of the production function describes the change in output, Y, as increasing amounts of variable input, X, are added to a bunch of fixed inputs this figure demonstrates two general assumptions we ve already discussed: 1) the production function is a continuous curve 2) inputs and \noutputs are perfectly divisible The Classical Production Function If the production function did not have perfectly divisible inputs and outputs, it would look like a series of dots 3) inputs and outputs are homogenous all inputs on the horizontal axis are of equal quality all units of output on the vertical axis are of equal market value example: all catfish have same $/lb value Describing the Production Function Algebraically The algebraic equation for the production function shown in the previous table, graph is Y = X 2 - 1/30X 3 Y = units of output resulting from some number of units of X if we input any value for X, within the range of X s, there will result a corresponding Y value on the curve thus, Y values can be predicted by substitution Law of Diminishing Returns Originally developed by early economists to describe the relationship between output and a variable input, when other inputs are constant if increasing the amount of one input is added to a production process while all others are constant, additional output will eventually decrease implies there is a \"right\" level of variable input to use with the combination of fixed inputs Law of Diminishing Returns Requires that the method of production does not change as variable input changes does not apply when all inputs are varied when the LDR is applied to production you get the classical production function increasing marginal returns at first and decreasing marginal returns afterwards it is possible that marginal returns could decrease in the beginning with the first application of the variable input Three Stages of Production The classical production function can be divided into three stages: First Stage : this means the average rate at which variable input (X) is transformed into product (Y) increases until it reaches its maximum this maximum indicates the end of Stage 1 Production Stage 1 Stage 1 deals with increasing bang for your buck or the phase of increasing production efficiency production efficiency is not just the maximum production level efficiency (also known as average physical product) is determined by dividing yield by its corresponding amount of input (Y/X) Stage 1 ends where Y/X is largest, around 150 lbs input Production Efficiency Three Stages of Production Stage 2 : physical efficiency of the variable input is at a peak at the beginning of Stage 2 note: efficiency of fixed input is at its maximum at the end of Stage 2 output/unit fixed input is largest when production is maximum Three Stages of Production Stage 3 : result of excessive quantities of variable input combined with fixed inputs in order for all this to make sense, we need to understand that production functions are used to determine the most profitable amount of variable input and output the production function allows you to make recommendations about input use even when input/output prices are unknown Economic Recommendations 1) using logic you can see that if your production follows that of the example given, you should increase inputs to achieve a production level at least until Stage 2 is reached;",0.4143191874027252],["X1011577343-00301-73991</DOCNO> The Early Years of the Theatre The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes&#44; Moving Picture Technicians&#44; Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States&#44; Its Territories and Canada&#44; AFL&#45;CIO&#44; CLC The IATSE is the labor union representing technicians&#44; artisans and craftspersons in the entertainment industry&#44; including live theatre&#44; film and television production&#44; and trade shows&#46; The Early Years of the Theatre In the late 1880&#39;s&#44; the legitimate theatre existed mostly in larger cities&#46; When producers and managers saw the response of the public to the legitimate theatre&#44; they realized the next step was to create traveling shows&#46; The development of a national rail system in the late 19th century made traveling shows much more feasible&#46; The touring companies could bring their own costumes&#44; props and even scenery&#46; One immediate effect of this trend was to reduce employment among local crews&#44; since these stagehands were no longer needed to construct scenery&#44; acquire props or make costumes for long&#45;running shows or local stock companies&#39; productions&#46; Despite this&#44; the road shows became a principal source of employment in the entertainment industry&#46; These shows employed not only traveling stagehands&#44; but would often pick up local crews as \nwell&#46; Estimates are that&#44; when road shows reached their peak in 1904&#44; there were some 420 companies touring the United States and Canada&#46; Because the sets and scenery were usually constructed in the larger metropolitan areas&#44; such as New York and Philadelphia&#44; a gradual division of skills resulted&#46; Certain stage mechanics became specialists in the construction of sets and props in scenic shops&#46; Others became experts in handling the output of these shops &#45; everything from packing the sets and loading them onto rail cars to running the show during performances&#46; However&#44; the usual story prevailed&#58; abuses were rampant&#46; Wages were cut arbitrarily and discriminatory practices were common&#46; There were many road shows that employed nonunion crews&#44; paying them very little and working them long hours&#46; When strikes were undertaken&#44; there was always conflict between the local membership&#44; the road stagehands and unscrupulous workers who would come from other cities to break the strike&#44; sometimes from Alliance local unions themselves&#46; Traveling stagehands were often forced to work in unfair theatres or found themselves stranded in distant locations and out of a job&#46; They frequently seized this as an opportunity to bring the local workers into the Alliance&#46; These very early organizing efforts served to spread word of the new Alliance and what it could do for its members&#46; It was in this environment that the Alliance moved to assert itself&#46; It soon became clear that the concerns of these early members centered on wages and working conditions&#46; The social reform characteristic of the Knights of Labor would simply not meet the needs of the stagehands&#46; The American Federation of Labor&#44; which practiced a brand of trade unionism focusing on job security and wages&#44; was a natural organization with which the Alliance could affiliate&#46; From the beginning&#44; the new union moved quickly to create mechanisms to enable it to fully represent the members&#46; At the first convention&#44; a simple constitution had been written&#44; per capita dues instituted&#44; and a minimum rate of pay established&#46; Specific conditions for work were set which called for strict departmentalization of jobs&#44; establishment of a standard eight&#45;hour work day&#44; and perhaps most importantly abolishing the system of employing actors and other unskilled workers as carpenters&#44; flymen and stagehands&#46; At the second convention&#44; the constitution and by&#45;laws were rewritten to reflect changes in the industry&#46; Work was undertaken to establish a union working card&#44; and a committee was appointed to create a union label&#46; In 1912&#44; the first blanket contract was established for road men&#46; Under this system&#44; bond posted with the International guaranteed transportation home&#44; as well as two weeks&#39; pay for shows that closed suddenly&#46; At the same time&#44; District No&#46; 1&#44; composed of locals in the Northwest&#44; created a system which allowed road men to send ahead to the next destination basic information such as the size and length of time the local crews would be needed&#46; This assured not only that there would be enough people to staff each theatre&#44; but it made it easier to ensure that these were union crews&#46; It worked so well that the International adopted the system a few years later&#46; It is now known as the yellow card system&#44; which is still in use today&#46; Despite difficult economic times&#44; the local unions survived&#46; Ironically&#44; the stability of the locals was not reflected in the leadership of the Alliance&#46; The top positions changed constantly&#46; At virtually every convention for the first several years&#44; a new president was elected&#46; Former President Lee Hart became General Secretary&#45;Treasurer in 1898 and served in that position until 1915&#46; His tenure was the longest of any leader until many&#44; many years later&#46; One reason for the frequent turnover was that these officers of the Alliance were not paid a salary&#44; with the exception of the General Secretary&#45;Treasurer&#44; who in 1895 had been awarded a salary of &#36;300 a year plus expenses&#46; In 1906&#44; the delegates finally voted to pay the International President a salary of &#36;1&#44;000 a year plus expenses&#46; Until that time&#44; the president had to rely on his craft to provide his income&#46; Consequently&#44; the president would often join a show when he had the chance&#44; and someone else would have to finish out his term&#46; It was not a very workable arrangement&#44; but the delegates had been reluctant to make the job a paid position&#44; given the scarce financial resources of the young Alliance&#46; The membership expected a lot from their officers&#46; For example&#44; the General Secretary&#45;Treasurer had no clerical help&#46; Brother Lee Hart&#44; who served so diligently from 1898 to 1915&#44; conducted lengthy correspondence&#44; all written out by him in longhand&#46; The decentralized nature of the organization made obtaining recognition for the union a slow&#44; painful process&#46; One lockout in Boston lasted seven years&#44; and there were similar situations in cities like St&#46; Louis and Detroit&#46; Despite these challenges&#44; during this period membership rose rapidly&#46; Estimates are that in 1893&#44; there were about 1&#44;500 members&#46; By 1900&#44; that figure had grown to about 3&#44;700 and by 1920 there were more than 21&#44;000 members in the Alliance&#46; The number of local unions grew at a speedy pace as well&#46; Locals were first organized in the larger cities&#44; and later in the more remote areas&#46; Annual conventions were held \nuntil 1913&#44; when the delegates voted to establish biennial conventions&#46; The conventions have followed a tradition set down in the very beginning&#44; something that has lasted to his day&#46; These are active&#44; hard&#45;working conventions which tackle all sorts of thorny questions and issues&#46; So it has always been&#46; Legislation is enacted&#44; complaints are heard&#44; and appeals are considered and determined&#46; Another complication in the early years was that the president&#44; the secretary&#45;treasurer and the other officers all lived in different cities&#46; With communications and transportation systems such as they were at the turn of the century&#44; it was almost impossible to carry out the business of the Alliance in a timely fashion&#46; In 1913&#44; international headquarters was firmly established in New York City&#44; and the president and the secretary&#45;treasurer were required to live there&#46; At last&#44; it seemed that the

Administrative/Operational Issues : Richard Hurst, Executive Director, Health Care Services Introductory Overview Costs Fee for Service Agreements Opportunities Presentation Doctor Blair Medical and Rehabilitation Services Introduction Role includes overseeing and providing service to injured workers, the vast majority of direct services are now provided by independent communities around the province The Board maintains working relationships through the service contracts and informal agreements with private providers, clinics and health care institutions Leslie R. Peterson Rehabilitation Centre is where most of our direct treatment service occurs Historically the centre provided most of the rehabilitation services for the compensation Board for the province However with the development of community \nservices widely in the province the centre's direct role has decreased The new role of the centre is both a leading and network of service providers and also a provider of some services It is also a resource for the WCB in terms of research, development and in teaching As the organization relies on external providers there is a need to effectively monitor and lead the provision of services throughout the province Medical services within the organization have a specific purpose in supporting effective claims management but we also see an additional and very important role to enhance quality of care and to lead the evolution to evidence based medicine We have a unique opportunity province wide because we are a link to the provider community Our network of medical advisors is well positioned and informed to promote the use of case management and a planned approach to care aimed at improving clinical outcomes We also have an opportunity to improve much broader outcomes for injured workers and for all WCB stakeholders such as More effective disability management Lower overall compensation costs Continuum of care for soft tissue injuries Effective management of recovery, return to work and reducing chronicity Continuum of care is designed to accomplish the following To effectively manage the process of recovery To follow the best evidence available in terms of treatment effectiveness To maintain the length of employment To track our results and monitor our outcome Provided a slide on soft tissue recovery &#150; referred to internally as the J curve and what it basically describes is the issues we face with soft tissue injuries in this province Injuries constitute about 40,000 short term disability claims annually in BC so it is slightly more than &#189; of the short term disability claims per year The upper most line which starts off purple and becomes yellow down below is the typical decay curve on this kind of injury The scale across the bottom is in weeks and the top is the 40,000 claims per year Within the first month more than &#189; - about 20,000 - 22,000 will recover spontaneously through the variety of treatment options available in community Recovery rate represents effectively the outcomes of all the different options available and it would range from what you might call optimum treatment in many instances all the way through to individuals who have had very little treatment of perhaps had treatment that interferes with their recovery I saw a similar graph from Ontario this morning and I think it was pretty much the same lines Think this is pretty universal in terms of these kinds of injuries Objective of this continuum of care is to recognize that this process can be improved upon by putting together a series of programs, which effectively pick up these injuries at about the point where there the acute stage is coming to an end The literature recognizes, and this is from many authors, that an acute stage in these injuries occurs in first 3 to 4 weeks After that point a sub-acute stage follows after for about 4 to 12 weeks and a more chronic process may begin indefinitely after about the12 week mark The older literature pegged the chronic point as being at 6 months but I understand now that it is probably occurring much sooner than that in many injuries Continuum of care is a plan to Organize and provide the necessary range of services in a seamless way To identify claimants most suited to the program and enable them to participate Under the early intervention programs system &#150; EIPS &#150; staff identify those workers suffering from soft tissue injury and they will contact worker at 3 or 4 week mark and review with them a brief list of questions, which are designed to determine if their only injury is a soft tissue injury, that there is no other confounding factor present, to determine whether they are about to return to work, if there is a plan for eminent return to work or to get a general sense of whether they would be amenable to be a part of this program All else being equal and with the concurrence of the attending physician or provider they are recommended to enter a work conditioning program at about the 4 week point, ideally, and this has a potential for 6 weeks of therapy based treatment, which will encourage recovery from the soft tissue injury This is recognizing again here that we are generally past the acute stage Should the individual not succeed in reaching a return to work status within the 6-week program they are then eligible to be seen by, assessed and perhaps enter an occupational rehabilitation program, which would pick up after that The occupational rehabilitation would theoretically start around the 10 week point and should continue for another 6 weeks Should all else fail and they are not ready to return to work at that point then pain programs are made available at approximately the 16 week point When this plan was first put together a target of 75% return to work was seen to be optimum and the current experience, in fact, is better than that It is in the order of 82 or 83% In theory that will reduce the number of workers even needing to go to occupational rehabilitation by a further 1200 cases based on an annual basis and a projection of those figures Our success with the work conditioning program so far is such that not only have they exceeded the target of 75% return to work but the average length of stay in those programs is about 18 to 20 days So that does not mean that people have to stay in the program if they are doing well Care plans are about setting expectations for injured workers, employers and for treatment providers about what is an optimum and what the literature supports doing If the \nattending physician does not feel that work conditioning, for example, is suitable medical rehabilitation programs are useful alternative suggestion and sometimes the most effective way to deal with that particular claim See submission for the network of work conditioning programs developed around the province over the past year or two Nearly all the small and medium size and certainly the larger communities are all served by at least one or more providers throughout BC Some of these provider's contracts are within institutions like local hospitals but more often they are with individual clinics or providers depending on the circumstance and the nature of the work load in the community Since the inception of the continuum it has been possible through teaching examples, encouragement and some coaching to steadily improve the results Two weeks ago a best of the best conference in our rehabilitation centre brought the external providers together to discuss recent advances, to share results and acknowledge the leaders within that group Worth noting that many of these same providers, 2 years ago, were of the impression that 50% return to work rate was best that could be achieved under this sort of a system The number of work conditioning providers in the province initially started out at a relatively low level and we are now at a point where there is 64 to 68 providers with contracts around the province Based on the current volume of soft tissue injuries as we refine our system for selection an optimum capacity, which will probably be slightly larger than this will be reached Extrapolating these figures &#150; see submission - to an annual level the current network can accommodate 10 &#150; 12,000 injured workers Future delivery model In broad terms this slide (see submission) describes key attributes of our evolving delivery model both in terms of service and effectiveness and some of the working relationships that we envisage in the future Medical and nurse advisor roles The intention of the role revision that is going on is To enhance the early clinical input to claims management To facilitate case planning and management as we move into case management To assist with the monitoring of progress and providing clinical knowledge to this process of a handling a claim In addition to the clinical role described here we will develop a greater internal and external role as educators, communicators on clinical issues and experts on work place injury and disability management This relates back to my earlier comments about the networks we have in place and its potential for optimizing care around the province The medical role was discussed briefly about 2 weeks ago It should be noted that for the foreseeable future there will continue to be a need for some of the traditional role where the attending physician needs an additional assessment or support perhaps for a return to work situation or whether the attending physician needs support on whether or not to wait for a specialist's consult, institute rehabilitation or both The most significant change in these roles and a benefit is in having an early overview and when needed input on each complex claim rather than taking the delayed role and waiting for the problems to surface There is also a potential role on claims, which are identified by our own outcomes monitoring where improvement could be sought in the care and where there is evidence supporting change and practice available in the literature The nurse advisor role was also mentioned a couple of weeks ago in the presentation and as you heard the Board has moved over the past 6 to 9 months to develop a nurse advisor role As an organization I believe that we have a history of late clinical input, which has worked against the interest of all if the truth be known There is clearly an opportunity to provide earlier assistance and guidance, to support the use of established clinical practice guidelines and to assist the external providers to improve outcomes To have effective clinical input to a large number of claims will require a sufficient number of staff with the appropriate levels of clinical knowledge Much of the clinical information needed in the claim's process can be efficiently provided by skilled nurse advisors Their professional status and clinical judgement as applied in virtually all other parts of health care can also be a resource for the WCB Worker's Choice Issues and Provider Networks With respect to worker's choice, the legislation in 21(7) &quot;without limiting the power of the Board under this section&ldots;",0.4127635657787323],["Username: Password: Post as &quot;Anonymous&quot;

Star, University of California at Santa Barbara, and Holly Dickinson, SUNY Buffalo A. INTRODUCTION need to have tools to transform spatial data of various types into digital format data input is a major bottleneck in application of GIS technology costs of input often consume 80% or more of project costs data input is labor intensive, tedious, error-prone there is a danger that construction of the database may become an end in itself and the project may not move on to analysis of the data collected essential to find ways to reduce costs, maximize accuracy need to automate the input process as much as possible, but: automated input often creates bigger editing problems later source documents (maps) may often have to be redrafted to meet rigid quality requirements of automated input because of the costs involved, much research has gone into devising better input methods - however, few reductions in cost have been realized sharing of digital data is one way around the input bottleneck more and more spatial data is becoming available in digital form data input to a GIS involves encoding both the locational and attribute data the locational data is encoded as coordinates on a particular cartesian coordinate system source maps may have different projections, scales several stages of data transformation may be needed to bring all data to a common coordinate system attribute data is often obtained and stored in tables Modes of data input keyboard entry for non-spatial attributes and occasionally locational data manual locating devices user directly manipulates a device whose location is recognized by the computer e.g. digitizing automated devices automatically extract spatial data from maps and photography e.g. scanning conversion directly from other digital sources voice input has been tried, particularly for controlling digitizer operations not very successful - machine needs to be recalibrated for each operator, after coffee breaks, etc. B. DIGITIZERS digitizers are the most common device for extracting spatial information from maps and photographs the map, photo, or other document is placed on the flat surface of the digitizing tablet Hardware the position of an indicator as it is moved over the surface of the digitizing tablet is detected by the computer and interpreted as pairs of x,y coordinates the indicator may be a pen-like stylus or a cursor (a small flat plate the size of a hockey puck with a cross-hair) frequently, there are control buttons on the cursor which permit control of the system without having to turn attention from the digitizing tablet to a computer terminal digitizing tablets can be purchased in sizes from 25x25 cm to 200x150 cm, at approximate costs from $500 to $5,000 early digitizers (ca. 1965) were backlit glass tables a magnetic field generated by the cursor was tracked mechanically by an arm located behind the table the arm's motion was encoded, coordinates computed and sent to a host processor some early low-cost systems had mechanically linked cursors - the free-cursor digitizer was initially much more expensive the first solid-state systems used a spark generated by the cursor and detected by linear microphones problems with errors generated by ambient noise contemporary tablets use a grid of wires embedded in the tablet to generate a magnetic field which is detected by the cursor accuracies are typically better than 0.1 mm this is better than the accuracy with which the average operator can position the cursor functions for transforming coordinates are sometimes built into the tablet and used to process data before it is sent to the host The digitizing operation the map is affixed to a digitizing table three or more control points (\"reference points\", \"tics\", etc.) are digitized for each map sheet these will be easily identified points (intersections of major streets, major peaks, points on coastline) the coordinates of these points will \nbe known in the coordinate system to be used in the final database, e.g. lat/long, State Plane Coordinates, military grid the control points are used by the system to calculate the necessary mathematical transformations to convert all coordinates to the final system the more control points, the better digitizing the map contents can be done in two different modes: in point mode, the operator identifies the points to be captured explicitly by pressing a button in stream mode points are captured at set time intervals (typically 10 per second) or on movement of the cursor by a fixed amount advantages and disadvantages: in point mode the operator selects points subjectively two point mode operators will not code a line in the same way stream mode generates large numbers of points, many of which may be redundant stream mode is more demanding on the user while point mode requires some judgement about how to represent the line most digitizing is currently done in point mode Problems with digitizing maps arise since most maps were not drafted for the purpose of digitizing paper maps are unstable: each time the map is removed from the digitizing table, the reference points must be re-entered when the map is affixed to the table again if the map has stretched or shrunk in the interim, the newly digitized points will be slightly off in their location when compared to previously digitized points errors occur on these maps, and these errors are entered into the GIS database as well the level of error in the GIS database is directly related to the error level of the source maps maps are meant to display information, and do not always accurately record locational information for example, when a railroad, stream and road all go through a narrow mountain pass, the pass may actually be depicted wider than its actual size to allow for the three symbols to be drafted in the pass discrepancies across map sheet boundaries can cause discrepancies in the total GIS database e.g. roads or streams that do not meet exactly when two map sheets are placed next to each other user error causes overshoots, undershoots (gaps) and spikes at intersection of lines diagram user fatigue and boredom for a complete discussion on the manual digitizing process, see Marble et al, 1984 Editing errors from digitizing some errors can be corrected automatically small gaps at line junctions overshoots and sudden spikes in lines error rates depend on the complexity of the map, are high for small scale, complex maps these topics are explored in greater detail in later Units Unit 13 looks at the process of editing digitized data Units 45 and 46 discuss digitizing error Digitizing costs a common rule of thumb in the industry is one digitized boundary per minute e.g. it would take 99/60 = 1.65 hours to digitize the boundaries of the 99 counties of Iowa C. SCANNERS Video scanner essentially television cameras, with appropriate interface electronics to create a computer-readable dataset available in either black and white or color extremely fast (scan times of under 1 second) relatively inexpensive ($500 - $10,000) produce a raster array of brightness (or color) values, which are then processed much like any other raster array typical data arrays from video scanners are of the order of 250 to 1000 pixels on a side typically have poor geometrical and radiometrical characteristics, including various kinds of spatial distortions and uneven sensitivity to brightness across the scanned field video scanners are difficult to use for map input because of problems with distortion and interpretation of features Electromechanical scanner unlike the video scanning systems, electromechanical systems are typically more expensive ($10,000 to 100,000) and slower, but can create better quality products one common class of scanners involves attaching the graphic to a drum as the drum rotates about its axis, a scanner head containing a light source and photodetector reads the reflectivity of the target graphic, and digitizing this signal, creates a single column of pixels from the graphic the scanner head moves along the axis of the drum to create the next column of pixels, and so on through the entire scan compare the action of a lathe in a machine shop this controls distortion by bringing the single light source and detector to position on a regular grid of locations on the graphic systems may have a scan spot size of as little as 25 micrometers, and be able to scan graphics of the order of 1 meter on a side an alternative mechanism involves an array of photodetectors which extract data from several rows of the raster simultaneously the detector moves across the document in a swath when all the columns have been scanned, the detector moves to a new swath of rows for an in-depth discussion scanning techniques, see Peuquet and Boyle (1984) Requirements for scanning documents must be clean (no smudges or extra markings) lines should be at least 0.1 mm wide complex line work provides greater chance of error in scanning text may be accidently scanned as line features contour lines cannot be broken with text automatic feature recognition is not easy (two contour lines vs. road symbols) diagram special symbols (e.g. marsh symbols) must be recognized and dealt with if good source documents are available, scanning can be an efficient time saving mode of data input D. CONVERSION FROM OTHER DIGITAL SOURCES involves transferring data from one system to another by means of a conversion program more and more data is becoming available in magnetic media USGS digital cartographic data (DLGs - Digital Line Graphs) digital elevation models (DEMs) TIGER and other census related data data from CAD/CAM systems (AutoCAD, DXF) data from other GIS these data generally are supplied on digital tapes that must be read into the computer however, CD-ROM is becoming increasingly popular for this purpose provides better standards CD-ROM hardware is much less expensive - CD-ROM drive $ \n1000, tape drive $14,000 Automated Surveying directly determines the actual horizontal and vertical positions of objects two kinds of measurements are made: distance and direction traditionally, distance measuring involved pacing, chains and tapes of various materials direction measurements were made with transits and theodolites modern surveyors have a number of automated tools to make distance and direction measurements easier electronic systems measure distance using the time of travel of beams of light or radio waves by measuring the round-trip time of travel, from the observing instrument to the object in question and back, we can use the relationship (d = v x t) to determine the distance an instrument based on timing the travel of a pulse of infrared light can measure distances on the order of 10 km with a standard deviation of +/- 15 mm the total station (cost about $30,000) captures distance and direction data in digital form the data is downloaded to a host computer at the end of each session for direct input to GIS and other programs Global Positioning System (GPS) a new tool for determining accurate positions on the surface of the earth computes positions from signals received from a series of satellites (NAVSTAR) as of April, 1990 there are 20 in orbit, by 1991 there should be the full set of 24 are currently 7 active but eventually will be 21 depends on precise information about the orbits of the satellites a radio receiver with appropriate electronics is connected to a small antenna, and depending on the method used, in one hour to less than 1 second, the system is able to determine its location in 3-",0.41142594814300537],["I don't wanna be no cement mason pop and push a wheely barrow half way roun the worl at the equator

most of which are prepositional, stunning a wave, from a crowd of people on the loading dock being noisy, a fractured sense of linearity, interconnectivity on the tongue, then someone came up to me, glasses until there is no need for drinking, framed by inconsistency, upon a shore where wave suns the rock of present tense before trickling away, too fast for me, according to accordions, wind as a function of musicality, toys which duplicate the operations of a desert military tactician, storms to distribute sand, having run off the road in a remote part of Africa, vehicle where none was desired, to be certain there are beaches there, close to where the bombs fell, convincing the coeditor, say it was four hundred and thirty two of this kind and three hundred and twelve of the other, what would that mean in a context of indeterminate poetics, who determines the density of the bombing patterns, floating into the deepest part of the fragmentary nature of things, what one never would have considered next, not that the terror could ever be thought to be so close or planned in a corporate office, formica on top, a cooling brought on by a sequence of popsicles, not to not to, charlatans though they be, utilizing a new instrument to monitor the apathy of voters before administering the drug, where foals rush in, freed from any sense of context, an inevitable failure, previous to ethics, alarming how considerate the managers of war can be when they are relaxing at home, an inviolate sense of fluoridation, if the word on the corner can be believed, a sexual overflow, not the last light on the street between the places where they live separately, not coordinated by a sign, of fish, pieces to make alive together 8 allowing for error, responses to presume notwithstanding, a blue streak, talked about for days, when a missile intercepts a missile, absence of ballast, moon enough for child's eye, containing a measure of respect for yellow flowers which appear in the evening as if nothing, a wild and woolly overcoat, to turn one's thoughts over, a hardnosed lumber town, tactfully done, bewildered by the ups and downs, having taken her own bags with her, thinking a circle implied a lack of waste while wondering what to do about its center, squares and triangles into their proper places, efficient as a clean strike on a clear February morning, a painting of flowers receding into gold interstices, spatially, where it disappears, uncertain mouths, a series of notes in ascending order played alphabetically, in a chiaroscuro way, late at night clouded by a sense of just having awakened, riding caps aloft, fears the beginning, laughs out loud only when distressed by screaming making its way through burning oil and bullets proving themselves in fleshy holes, streets disappearing into rain, reaching hand above for a red shirt not a bit like winter, sympathy for the refrain, not intending the vocabulary to be so musical or floral but not having planned for the ocean either, landscape like grammar, everywhere, particulars settling in the illuminated dust, so you know the way light bends around a finger when held before a lamp or flashlight, assuming the moon in a growing phase, a sunned humming intended as diversion, not in any sense randomly formed, intergalactic meaning in one's own kitchen by lamplight, a dream of flying over oceans, immerse oneself, never asexual 9 crayola as a way of life, two colors intending a shoe, sewing two leaves of paper a planned sequence not consecutive, X 's marked on a map where previously cities, refugees by the tens of thousands, extending a hand only to find its bones too fragile to hold firmly, not the skin smoothly remembered, at falling from window ledge having grown older a leap unconsidered, political solutions which do not preclude literal explosions, certain absences in the color scheme, round or yeasted growing beneath intellectual vacuums, had she only known before removing her slippers, not so obvious as one thought, first last and unblemished, nine copies of her gracious reluctant, a child's pattern including dog and cow, laboring until the point of release, wanting to tell the truth, a narrow corridor leading to her, pleasures not intended thereby more intense, writing a way through one to another, never shaking the same stick, blowing a misconception of what the mouth thinks about in a room hiding it all, hiking miles to a snowy ridge sixteen years ago, Europe as a center of exchange, lakeside a site of beached fish, bags of flies and objects mailed as art to various private collections, Chicago needing a bath, at angles from a pentagon of unequal sides lines leading to the field's far boundaries glowworm glimmer, towels of blue and green stacked neatly, wet hair enticing, gaps in memory filled with a partial language, to love to be astonished, leading to absolution, forgetful of her love of private acts in public places, tracing a hand upon a wrist, the need for repairs as in a country burned and bleeding, attain a state of divinity, removed from one's origins, saying less than was possible 10 reading the proof, comparing a statement with a twist on an old theme, of thee I meditate if only for a bereaved moment, a father when one wishes there were none, on a green field with white lines and patches of dirt \nharder than it should be because these are only schoolboys, as if you didn't like him, then a home run, not an itch one might scratch at a board meeting, entering the mural as though its walls were the illusion, a flying banshee, on an evening during the Christmas season with a friend named Fred moving from station to station trying to keep up with a hormonal imbalance, a speculum of otherness, in which, as new as a sentence standing in the rain, before the weather changed the escapees, refuge from what, a choice between a despotic ruler and friendly bombing raids several times daily, a shelf of books more or less leaning in the same direction, all of love bound in a blue notebook, a man whose fingers frame his eyes, playing chess with a timer, not inhibited by a fear of eroticism, a black cover hiding the text, the same color ink as page, because one never remembers the details in the same order or otherwise, a persona for mending, in reply to yours of March 14, where a meeting can only be arranged with stamps, forgetful of history when he cast me out from among his friends toward a desert of certain letters arranged without the requirements of passion, color coded for ease in beautification, when a brush of ink makes a stain of iniquity, or a cheer goes up for destruction on a scale unimaginable, despite the consequences painted in blue on ceramic tiles installed individually, forming alliances with question marks, not discussion but dialogue, or someone else 11 sleeping with lambs but not touching, organs aplenty, free fall, beginning with a sacrificial animal, arguing for parity of nations following an invasion like that of Grenada or Kuwait, to remember only one phrase, sometimes or that of another, taking its sense through what she says, the letters of your name being the definition of cubism, the first page marked with a brown marker as something distinguishable from blue in a nutshell, as if territory were something to be destroyed when power has to do with resources underneath which may be exportable, journals altered before everything settles, even disabled until moons offer nothing demonstrable in the way of tangible rewards a skin can tingle with, translated, composition of an alphabet out of the world in increments not entirely measurable, high density, a kiss for the French, nocturnal ramblings at half past noon, to feel the heat of the blast and remember it as caused by a country intent on liberation, neither novel nor poem, a combination of genres to which volatility was ascribed but how can that approach a warhead, universal suffrage, a sister in name and tissue only except when the chips are down, arranging the tapes in terms of decibels, taxed beyond her limits but not protesting at the physical pleasure of it all, a type cast by a shore, so small that others must wait for the gate to open, entering by rote, announcing the spring volition among the lilacs, not for show or intense suffering, letting liquid fill a vessel, blue lilacs 12 The History of Western Philosophy bubbles instead of ice cream this afternoon with shadows, rather striking for a seven a.m. ensemble, not crippled unless she chooses a grip employed strictly by the upper leg extended at a steep angle, sand and rock reshaped by continued explosions, ultimately of no consequence according to state department spokesmen, a quick opening, where hills inhabit lengthy effort, who are trained in rhetoric, with sequence, a choir of Chinese bells, freedom for what is now deemed an autonomous region urged by a balding man in glasses adorned with orange robes, dressed to kill meaning wearing a military uniform, a painted bride, a powerful tale from another millennium, effortless, or disguised as a pear, free of whiteness, a protested war nonetheless even though that point of view largely remains unheard, as if an egg were adorned with glitters of color and wrapped in streamers of bright paper, announcing a free ride, child's hand reaching for rising balloon, fears the morning, mechanically strummed while waiting for gender, eyes wide and amazed, to be learned while watching someone so small, fire as a tool for keeping winter on the run, The History of Western Philosophy being the title of a performance, strained carrots, air escaping from her lips held tight along with closed eyes applying pressure a physical joy, appearing without clothes, loving the nature of alchemical changes, that this beautiful new edition of his words, your only commitment to the coast, sturdy, collecting her things before leaving to spend more time walking in a green world, acknowledging violence, formed slowly near the beginning of the experiment, held in one's palm 13 not to blow up the moon, great taste made affordable, her military sinews translated into male terms, like a desert with its craters and seas that seemed ancient, ample, malformed but not cognizant, who are skilled in the lessons of seduction, smiled madly into the heat, from a center not the other way around, comfortable with guns, not the way teaching began, with black fog, spoken while running on a court audible to a few, champing at the bitten fruit not another piece of pie that brought all this upon us, child indicating rain, not dyed or injected with perfume, simultaneity as an aspect of ritual but not prefigured as were the bombing runs, boring no one, layers of color not entirely distinct from one another, with every egg keeping less yeast, foreign, offering forgiveness to blue oceans, into an enclosure, where we began as in cut and past until he repeats himself or discovers another presence, crossed out, attending a funeral in which the deceased had never been identified, change of shoes, form an old book which had sat upon a shelf for more than a decade but never lost as in the way the river turns into the earth, the \ngrandmothers, not upset with all the destruction, a parental attitude nearly always a mistake in diplomacy, over the border where we miss them very much, a recognized postmark, birth toward waiting for substance, not to begin another, issues walking, technical information disguising the blood, arrangements of fork and spoon as indicators of integrity, not the wine, always more print than person, descending as a gift, on a train sleeping through Pennsylvania where the early morning woods contributed silver, struggling to be brown or not at all 14 and plenty of breathing, plethora of blue jays, anticipating water, folded into thirds, thrusting, speaking to the window, frosted, and swift, ginger biscuits, that time when the announcement came that the first plane had been shot down more tragic than with the tables turned, frightened of bright lights in the darkness, the horse's tail, nineteen forty-six, when war becomes what was expected because of one country's posture and another's act of aggression as if it were not really about money and the smell, satisfied, announced but not forthcoming, trying to equate dollars with the possibility of words, ashen-faced, not attended as a parade, a cry from the next room child awakening from early afternoon nap in green, the care with which, clipping cat's claws after an incident with dog, eloping, denying the rain as if desert stays where it began forming crystals fine dust settles, asking not more than is necessary, in a blue shirt changing, that shape erotic even when not visible through the wall to the next room, she said, loaded with books to publish and a lack of money, thirty years how many words might that be tomorrow or then, a light illuminating upwards through dispersal, black dog wrapped in toward herself sleeping, the smell of an oven cleaning itself not napalm or wasn't that a different war this one much cleaner so they said, portraying a land mass as noun, green house with red roof and blue door she made, unable to speak, not a thing a sentence, masking a truth but only one, framed, two ears as though ready, a still line even when judged, driving in snow, imagined as furnishings in bright colors could there be a lake there as well, a small hole in the fabric 15 marking time as a veil through which a voice makes an entrance softly or not at all, black dog with eyes closed, allowing a dare, book divided into letters, what else concerning the door's hinges, alternative to the toaster, melting as remembered from the museum at Hiroshima seen when ten years old not then thinking about war as something to be experienced in one's own lifetime, not the life of sex but otherwise, sized according to prevailing winds, bolder than the north, not to be interpreted except by chemical fraternity, bowdlerized, the author of well-paced sentences, lying with one ear to the ocean wishing it were approachable by hand, in love with tertiary matters, sacred only to the watched, hot dogs never a thing of the past, a case of uppers articulated, not only with the mouth but that voluptuous as well, a window to the room where it all happened escaping, plus or minus, encountering difficulties when working in reds beyond a certain density, pointed, a killing on the market not intended as a metaphor, initial attempts at conversation halted physically, free of the past, made by hand but whose, rivulets, strained to the point of becoming linear again not like military thinking, as advertised, to have left and returned because a case was to be made for more words, clarity alone as an intention, dropped as a line in the water and retrieved by a fish to be, sparked with lights but not electric to the skin, not removed but restated, her witness taking the shape of kiss unresolved, a tension assuming rigidity as a statement of fact, blundered into meeting the wave head-on, full of heart and wanting, there, howling perhaps if not entirely concerned with the weather 16 cherries instead of leaves avoided, spoiled, black moon, aging with doctors intact, childish or never having gone to bed in tears without a reason, standing to maintain tension, fruit for the way it feels in the mouth, tongues for entanglement, returning home after having been refugees the aftermath of war but is it, red pillow, hear head moving in a singular rhythm asymmetrical with moans, to the tune of one's terror, as if the daily were not enough but of course, with tail, cherubic, her way in the bath where small boats steady themselves, back to the desert, and the air warming where the rain became policy, musical and malleable, set up as a structure in which rigidity was not impossible nor surprise, a painting traded for a fireplace, who love to walk in green fields carrying sticks but not a game or anything which might be gambled, guarantee the future of nightfall before wanting, steep, statement of loose intentions at least honored in the utterance, so you have to sell and eat the seeds, rolling with someone remembered, skins, asking, turning the station to a woman with short white hair and black shirt speaking forthrightly, steering wheel to steady hands, feeling one's chest as if waiting for a lover not tonight but will you, this phrasing unreliable except as here, for a visual thrill or still life, who love to eat and perhaps take food seriously at least daily, a piece of looking glass opened sharply to the gap in his neck, to have an island available, at the fear of shooting an enemy where identification was not entirely possible, returning the book after much study, under the table where he said he could, meeting you, cat where dog was, loving bread if nothing else, the ability to sleep arc of light/dark matter was published by the The Segue Foundation in 1992, and \nis still in print.",0.4092874825000763]]
