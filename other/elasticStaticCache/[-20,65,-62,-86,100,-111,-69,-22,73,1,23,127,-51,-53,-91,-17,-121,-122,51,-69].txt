by copulating throughout the menstrual cycle without external evidence of peak fertility periods to restrict sexual activity Both of these facilitate long-term pair bonding The Aquatic Ape Partly in response to &quot;Man the Hunter&quot; evolutionary scenarios, Elaine Morgan proposed that hominid evolution was primarily a female phenomenon She says that several female characteristics such as higher body fat levels and less body hair came along with standing bipedally in the surf off East Africa In this model, males splash along behind Walking efficiency Human bipedal running is both slower and less energetically efficient for running than is chimpanzee knuckle-walking However, for normal walking locomotion, for instance from one food source to another, human bipedal walking is more energetically efficient than is chimpanzee knuckle-walking Energy Efficiency Walking speed Species Energy cost ml 02/kg/hr Energy cost relative to quadruped 2.9 km/hr Chimp 0.522 149% Human 0.193 86% 4.5 km/hr Chimp 0.426 148% Human 0.170 94% 2.9 km/hr is normal knuckle-walking speed of chimps, 4.5 km/hr is normal bipedal walking speed of humans (Rodman and McHenry 1980) Bipedalism would confer an adaptive advantage especially in times of low food availability and sparse distribution of food resources Bipedal humans would expend less energy to move from patch to patch of food, and would get there faster on average than knuckle-walking early pongids In a changing environment such as that found at the close of the Miocene, food resources became more sparsely distributed as forests shrank and expanded The ability to move from one forest patch to another efficiently would have been adaptive Bipedal hominids would have been well suited to do this Last Modified: 05/18/01 e-mail me at: jbindon@tenhoor.as.ua.edu",0.8787727952003479],["Given that most of the body s changes appear to be physiologic adaptations to its new environment, perhaps a period of reconditioning before returning to Earth-normal gravity would be better tolerated, more natural .",0.8501309752464294],["If more radiation fell upon the Earth and the amount reflected didn't change the Earth would become warmer.",0.837761640548706],["Our hypothesis is that these changes cause transient increases in permeability, and that it is during these transients, while the wall is adapting to its changed fluid dynamic environment, that most of the uptake of fats by the wall \ntakes place.",0.8290387392044067],["The most obvious change is an increase in the relative amount of fat and a decrease in lean body mass, caused mainly by a decrease in the amount of muscle.",0.8285035490989685],["There&#146;s enough fat on his body now to help him make the transition to what will be a far cooler, drier environment.",0.8268277645111084],["Now lets say the climate in Alaska became warmer and warmer, the Polar Bear would be able to cope with it because all it has to do is loose some of its body fat.",0.7904471158981323],["Tyler noted that its tiny amounts of herbs would at most cause a slight diuresis (output of body water), but would have no effect whatsoever on appetite or body fat.",0.7882055640220642],["Most vertebrates would have difficulty living in gravel that is constantly stirred by tidal action, but the flexibility of the bodies of \"Luciogobius\" is likely an adaptation to this environment.",0.7767500281333923],["This product is designed for Body Builders, Exercise fanatics, World Class Athletes and people who simply would like to increase their muscle mass in relation to their body fat and do it with a very limited amount of exercise.",0.7647092342376709],["The amount of precipitation on extreme wet (or snowy) days most likely would increase, but changes in the lengths of wet or dry spells are not clear.",0.764600396156311],["Adaptation is the notion of organisms responding to a changing environments by evolving either a form or function of the body that would better suite it in the environment.",0.7479265928268433],["Adaptation is the notion of organisms responding to a changing environments by evolving either a form or function of the body that would better suite it in the environment.",0.7479265928268433],["% fat, with summers and warmer and drier winters encouraging years.",0.7407819628715515]]
