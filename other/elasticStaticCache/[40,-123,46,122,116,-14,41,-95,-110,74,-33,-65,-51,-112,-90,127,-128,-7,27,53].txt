organisms decrease the physical size of plant litter particles (making them more accessible to microbial decomposers) microbial contributions - decomposition of organic materials is dependent upon conditions tropical - temperature greater than 25C plus abundant moisture causes rapid plant litter decomposition (soil low in organic matter) temperate - varying temperature and water availability slows down decomposition, resulting in accumulation of plant litter on soil surface (eventually results in richer soil) cool coniferous forests - lower temperatures and seasonal variation of water availability result in excessive accumulation of plant litter and production of organic acids during cool, moist periods (burns are the major nutrient recycling mechanism here) bogs - waterlogged soil
