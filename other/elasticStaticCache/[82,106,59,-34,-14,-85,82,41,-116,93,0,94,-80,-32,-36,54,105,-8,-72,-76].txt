capture information on film, tape, etc. Share ideas, data, or summaries of investigations with children (at other schools) by electronic communication Prepare various types of tables and graphs as a means for summarizing and analyzing data which they have collected Use calculators to perform mathematical calculations with data which has been collected and recorded Describe ways that machines are used to manufacture items faster and in greater quantity than one person can do alone Talk with local plumbers, electricians, water treatment personnel, fire fighters, etc. about how their jobs have changed because of changes in technology Describe what would occur if the power in their home was disconnected during a snowstorm, and what behavior changes would be necessary Unifying Themes and Concepts (CS 6) Students will be able to: Explore and identify the parts and materials that comprise simple objects and how they are connected (e.g. disassemble common household objects) Predict the effect of removing or exchanging parts of an object (e.g. a mechanical toy, a jigsaw puzzle) Discuss how parts when put together can do things that they could not do by themselves Assemble a commercial product using manufacturer's instructions (e.g. Legos, plastic models) Design and build a simple device with a desired function from accessible materials Describe or demonstrate how something may not work well if a part is missing, broken, worn out, mismatched, or misconnected.",0.8641915321350098]]
