structure poor agricultural practices poor road construction practices Leave the soil bare and unprotected (see 14.21) Let wind and water do their work Perhaps help them by over-irrigating (see 14.20) Important: distinguish between Erosion Soil erosion natural process human-caused natural rates accelerated rates Consequences of soil erosion loss of topsoil loss of agricultural productivity (see Table 14.3) loss of forestry productivity siltation of streams damage to aquatic ecosystems siltation of reservoirs loss of reservoir capacity (see Table 14.4) extreme case: Sanmexia dam, Yellow River, China: filled up in 4 years it was rehabilitated, by digging tunnels into the base of the dam and flushing out the \nsediment --- a major expense Soil salinization The recipe for soil salinization is also easy (recall our previous discussion of Irrigation and Salinization in the lecture on Surface Water ) Begin with an arid climate Irrigate crops with water containing dissolved solids (river water or groundwater will do) Allow irrigation water to evaporate... leaving the dissolved solids behind in the soil AND/OR Allow irrigation water to infiltrate without drainage water table rises soil is exposed to groundwater with high dissolved solids Consequences of soil salinization loss of soil fertility in extreme cases, the land loses its ability to produce crops Soil pollution (recall our previous lecture on Water Pollution ) agricultural biocides and fertilizers industrial waste disposal, leaks, and spills Consequences of soil pollution damage to soil ecosystem loss of soil fertility pollution of crops soil acts as a source of pollutants which move to hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere Soil mining agriculture involves taking something out of the soil plant nutrients organic matter the obvious response is to put something back in the modern approach has been to use processed fertilizers that replace only a few major nutrients the result is that the soil becomes depleted in some nutrients and in organic matter in other words, the soil is being mined which has negative implications for long-term soil fertility and agricultural sustainability Soil problems as creeping environmental problems Develop slowly from year to year Manageable in the short-term Irreversible in the long-term Play an important role in human history e.g., irrigation in Mesopotamia: transition from wheat to salt-tolerant barley to desert conversely, the long development of Chinese civilization must surely owe something to the long sustainability of paddy rice cultivation Coping with soil problems Agricultural practices terraced slopes (see 14.22) and contour plowing prevention of over-grazing zero-tillage protects soil structure, but may require additional
