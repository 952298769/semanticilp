Removed wildlife habitat Altered hydrologic cycle (increased runoff and percolation) Polluted water and air If impacts was severe enough, it could threaten the life of the city (fertile crescent)

somewhere to dump its garbage, for example) One way we can measure the amount of space necessary to support a city is to measure its ecological footprint Ecological Footprint The ecological footprint concept tries to measure how much nature people consume Calculates the number of acres required to support a population the ecological footprint of any defined population (from a single individual to
