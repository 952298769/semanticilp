Geological Definition of Minerals naturally occuring inorganic solids possess a definite internal structure have specific chemical composition Fig, Internal Structure of Halite (salt) and Demo Model of Halite in halite the atoms of chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na) are arranged in an orderly way this pattern is repeated in three-dimensions both well-formed crystals and \"massive\" examples have this internal order Note about Chemical Symbols The chemical symbols for the elements are a convenient shorthand You will need to recognize the symbols for the elements that are most common in minerals Table 2.2 on page 23 lists the name and symbol for more elements than you need to know Demo Models of Graphite and Diamond the minerals graphite and diamond illustrate the importance of the arrangement of the atoms both these minerals are made of the element (C) in graphite the carbon atoms are \narranged in six-sided hexagons within sheets the sheets are loosesly connected or bonded together this makes this mineral soft and means that we can mark paper with it this is also why graphite is useful as a dry lubricant in contrast diamond has firm bonds that make it the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth the difference in the arrangement of the atoms make these two substances different minerals with radically different properties although they have the same composition Fig, Specific Composition Chemical laws control which elements can join (bond) relative proportions of elements May be fixed Graphite = C Halite = NaCl Or vary within limits Olivine (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 Fig, Fayalite when olivine contains mainly iron in the space between the SiO 4 tetrahedra it is called fayalite Demo SiO 4 is the most important building block of minerals the four-sided shape is created when a silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms in olivine SiO 4 is joined to Fe (iron) or Mg (magnesium) atoms Fig, Fosterite when olivine contains mainly magnesium (Mg) joined to the SiO 4 tetrahedra it is called fosterite Fig, Physical Properties of Minerals these properties allow us to identify minerals and are responsible for many of the ways in which minerals are useful to us Sight Properties (can be determined by looking closely at a mineral) shape colour lustre cleavage Simple Test Required hardness specific gravcity streak magnetism reaction to acid Fig, Shape well-formed crystals reflect the orderly internal arrangement of atoms crystal forms (such as the well-formed crystals of quartz in Figure 4 ) are rarely seen because most minerals grow under less than ideal conditions habit is the way that a mineral typically forms most minerals are massive Fig, Colour warning: colour is often deceptive useful in determining the variety use the other properties first to identify the mineral colour of the fresh surface of metallic minerals is often characteristic Fig, Lustre the quality and intensity of the light reflected from a mineral
