solution at temperatures approaching boiling, and then, once in solution, solidifies the medium at room (&lt;40 C) temperature (b) Subsequent exposure to high temperature (i.e., boiling) will melt the medium (c) Exposure to relatively low temperatures (i.e., &gt;40 C), however, will not melt the medium, thus allowing incubation of solid medium at various temperatures (compare to gelatin which liquefies at 37 C) (d) Once boiled, agar-containing medium will stay liquid at 45 C (e) This allows solid medium to be poured into various vessels at temperatures that will not kill most cells (nor melt vessels), followed by a solidification of the medium (f) (g) [ &quot;solid medium&quot; and bacteria ( Google Search )] [ index ] (14) Colonies (a) Colonies represent piles of cells descended,
