[["The Formation of Sediment: Weathering - weathering and erosion counteract processes which uplift and reconstitute continental crust (mountain building and volcanism at convergent plate margins) - weathering reduces the grain size, and dissolves crustal materials allowing them, through erosion, to be transported by wind and water to the ocean basins I. Erosion - this is a process whereby rock and soil materials are moved under the influence of gravity through mechanisms such as mud slides, flow of glacial ice, flow of water in rivers, wind - erosion by water, followed by deposition of eroded materials, forms the majority of the sedimentary rocks that we observe on the earth's surface - without erosion, the products of weathering would not be transported and sedimentary deposits would not exist II.",1.6744823455810547],["The Wind River Mountains are a result of erosional processes which carved the peaks after enormous compressional forces

9.2720 LANDFORMS AND ROCK STRUCTURE The study of landforms is called geomorphology : science of landforms, including their history and processes of origin Landforms : configuration of the land surface taking distinctive forms and produced by natural processes Examples: hill, mountain, valley, plateau, floodplain, cliff, canyons ***Landforms are the surface expression of the lithosphere and owe their development to processes originating from both within and outside the earth s surface Two types of processes that are shaping Earth s surface: Internal (tectonics, volcanic and earthquake activity): INITIAL LANDFORMS Example: Mountains are formed by movement in the earth s crust (tilt fault, folds, volcanic activity ) External (weathering, erosion by running water, wind, waves): SEQUENTIAL LANDFORMS \nExample: Some plains are formed by erosion over long periods of time (streams or glaciers) while others are formed by accumulation of material deposited by water, glaciers, or wind Denudation : total action of all processes whereby the exposed rocks of the continents are worn down and the resulting sediments are transported to the sea by the fluid
