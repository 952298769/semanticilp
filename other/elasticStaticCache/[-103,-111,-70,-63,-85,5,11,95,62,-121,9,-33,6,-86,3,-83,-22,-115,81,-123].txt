[["The milk of domestic cats contains eight times more protein than human milk and three times as much fat. Kittens grow rapidly as their mother uses her body reserves to produce milk. One study showed that mothers lost an average of 5.7 grams per day when lactating. As might be expected, kittens from larger litters are smaller and put on weight more slowly than kittens from smaller litters. Kittens in litters of seven or eight had a mean growth rate of 7.3 grams per day, whereas the mean growth rate nearly doubled to 13.7 grams per day for kittens in litters of two. In general, kittens double their birth weight in a week, triple it in two weeks, and quadruple it in three weeks.
