Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels . These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows . Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights , marbles , and beads . When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic , they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass .
