[7] For example, in the picture on the bottom of the page, a 100mL graduated cylinder was used to measure the liquid. The cylinder contains 60mL liquid volume. The main reason as to why the reading of the volume is done via meniscus is due to the nature of the liquid in a closed surrounded space. By nature, liquid in the cylinder would be attracted to the wall around it through molecular forces. This forces the liquid surface to develop either a convex or concave shape, depending on the type of the liquid in the cylinder. Reading the liquid at the bottom part of a concave or the top part of the convex liquid is equivalent to reading the liquid at its meniscus . [8] From the picture, the level of the liquid will be read at the bottom of the meniscus , which is the concave. The most accurate of the reading that could be done here is reduced down to 1 mL due to the given means of measurement on the cylinder. From this, the derived error would be one tenth of the least figure. For instance, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 36.5 mL.

Volume can be measured directly with equipment designed using graduations marks or indirectly using length measurements depending on the state (gas, liquid, or solid) of the material. A graduated cylinder, for example, is a tube that can hold a liquid which is marked and labeled at regular intervals, usually every 1 or 10 mL. Once a liquid is placed in the cylinder, one can read the graduation marks and record the volume measurement. Since volume changes with temperature, graduated equipment has limits to the precision with which one can read the measurement. Solid objects that have regular shape can have their volume calculated by measuring their dimensions. In the case of a box, its volume equals length times width times height.",1.8143441677093506],["One of the most used methods is; introducing the body whose volume is to be measured in a graduated cylinder with a given volume of water: submerging the body, the volume of liquid displaced is equal to the volume of the body.",1.7892789840698242],["GRADUATES (GRADUATED CYLINDERS) The graduate is generally used for a close, approximate measure of volume.",1.7869466543197632],["The combination of cohesive and adhesive forces means that a slight concave curve, known as the meniscus, exists at the surface of most liquids.
