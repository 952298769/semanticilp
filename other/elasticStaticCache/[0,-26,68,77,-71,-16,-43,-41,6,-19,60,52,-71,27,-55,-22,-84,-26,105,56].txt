As they are most familiar, we will consider the life cycle of a pine tree. As an adult, mature tree, the pine produces two different types of cones, pollen cones (male) and ovulate cones (female). The male gametophytes exist within special sacs as pollen grains, while the female gametophytes, the eggs, are held within ovules, protected by a layer called the integument. The integument has a single opening, called the micropyle.  An ovule may hold one or more eggs.   When the pollen grains are mature they are released and borne by the wind to the ovules' micropyles. If they are accepted by the ovule, the pollen grains germinate and produce a tube leading into the integument. The sperm, held within the pollen grains, pass down these tubes and meet the eggs, which they fertilize. When the eggs are fertilized, the integument thickens into a seed coat, to protect the embryonic plant within. The seed also has nutritive tissues which supply food for the embryo until the seed can germinate and the plant can produce food for itself through photosynthesis. The seed, when developed and mature, is released in a variety of ways, including wind dispersal. If it finds suitable growing conditions where it lands, the seed will germinate and develop into a new plant, capable on maturity of producing more seeds and continuing the cycle.",2.094963550567627],["Food: tree bark, seeds",2.0581820011138916],["The different types of mustard trees produce varying seeds.
