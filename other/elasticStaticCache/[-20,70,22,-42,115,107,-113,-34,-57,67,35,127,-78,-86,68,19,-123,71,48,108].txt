[["Several types of life forms form the food web. Green plants that can make their own food through photosynthesis are the web's producers. They form the bottom of the chain. Animals that get food from other animals and plants are consumers. Decomposers feed off dead plants and animals because decomposers cannot make their own food. Every member in the food web is a predator, prey or both. For instance, one predator may become the prey for another predator.",2.1576011180877686]]
