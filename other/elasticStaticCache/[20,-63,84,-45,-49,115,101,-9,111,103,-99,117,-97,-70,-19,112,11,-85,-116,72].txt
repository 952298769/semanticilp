understanding of these five elements and their relationships governs the use of colour, fabric, light and objects wood describes the beginning of the natural cycle, the bursting forth of green shoots in Spring or the rising of the sun in the East, an expanding or increasing rate of energy - it is associated with the colour of the green dragon - and in the natural cycle draws on water and forms the fuel for fire fire the peak of the natural cycle, the high heat of Summer or the midday sun in the South, when energy is at its most active - it is associated with the colour of the red phoenix - and in the natural cycle burns wood and creates earth earth the pauses in the natural cycle, when energy is changing, like Summer's end while the fruit matures before autumn begins - it is associated with the centre of things and the colour yellow - and in the natural cycle comes from fire's ashes and yields mineral ores for metal metal the waning of the natural cycle, the falling leaves in Autumn or the setting of the sun in the West, a contracting or decreasing rate of energy - it is associated with the colour of the white tiger - and in the natural cycle is drawn from earth and produces water water the low point in the natural cycle, the deep cold of Winter or the darkness of night, when energy is at its least active preparing for the next period of growth - it is associated with the colour blue or black of the dark warrior of the North - and in the natural cycle comes from metal and feeds wood FIVE ELEMENTS - the natural cycles as described above each of these 'elements' draws from the previous and feeds the next in a sequence called the mutual or feeding cycle - where (descriptively) wood fuels fire, fire 's ashes create earth, earth yields metal ore, metal produces water and water feeds wood this is often likened to a generator and, like a generator, without a regulator would run out of control and overheat - there is, as would be expected, a complimentary sequence that controls or constrains the first - where (descriptively) wood binds earth, earth holds back water, water extinguishes fire, fire melts metal, and metal chops down wood using the FIVE ELEMENTS the direction from which the energy flows, as it enters a building or room, determines the element, and the use of the room governs whether the element that feeds or calms it should be selected - for example an office or kitchen would be better with increased energy levels, while a bedroom or rest area would be better with calmer \nenergy levels once the appropriate element has been chosen, a
