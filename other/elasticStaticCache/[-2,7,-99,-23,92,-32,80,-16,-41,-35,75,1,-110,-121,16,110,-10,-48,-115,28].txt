stars varies from Approximately 3000 o K for M stars to Approximately 50,000 o K for O stars Main-sequence stars are all members of one luminosity class, luminosity class V However, they vary from extremely luminous O stars to very faint M dwarfs Range of about a billion in luminosity Because of their number and common internal structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up

Main-Sequence Stars From orbital motion of binary stars, astronomers able to estimate masses of component stars in binary system Observed that masses of main-sequence stars increases from spectral class M up main sequence to spectral class O Mass-luminosity relation - plot of mass against luminosity (where possible) Luminosity of main-sequence stars proportional to approximately fourth power of mass Mathematical form: L a M 4 Other Properties of Main-Sequence Stars Radii of stars on main sequence increases from small radii M dwarfs to large radii O stars Luminosity, temperature, radius, and mass for main sequence stars increases from M to O stars Fundamental property upon which other three depend is mass of gas composing main-sequence stars Red Giants Red giants - second most prominent region in H-R diagram composed bright, cool stars Red giants are luminous stars in spectral classes F, G, K, and M lying above main sequence in region that angles up toward bright, cool stars in upper right-hand corner Despite being members of same luminosity class, red giants vary by at least a factor of 100 in luminosity 100 times more luminous than Sun on average Surface temperature varies 3000

supergiants - if late-type stars in classes G, K, and M Blue and red supergiants can be hundreds of thousands of times more luminous than Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and red supergiants White Dwarfs White dwarfs - span spectral classes \nB, A, and F, and

(700,000 km) making them about size of Earth (7,000 km) Consequently, white dwarfs must have mean densities on order of millions of g/cm 3 Suggests white dwarfs composed of matter in state unlike
