theory: being in a group improves access to resources being in a group improves the ability of females to defend resources which they would not be able to do as well if they were alone with their infants this is likely to be true if: food is relatively scarce and high in value that is, the benefit of controlling access to it is high food sources are in patches small enough that they can be defended food patches are large enough to support several individuals in a group these conditions are often true of fruits, a common part of primate diets evidence that suggests that the resource defense theory is correct in some cases: where ranges overlap, larger groups generally can defeat smaller groups of the same species for access to food patches females in the larger groups tend to have higher reproductive success than those in the smaller groups of the same species so the tendency to live in larger groups would be selected for... evidence against the resource defense theory true, larger groups get more access to food patches, but individuals within those groups have greater competition for food within the patches from their fellow group members so there must be some optimum group size that balances these factors Charles Janson's study of brown capuchin monkeys showed that individuals within groups varied by 37% in the calories of food they ate, while the average calorie intake of entire groups only differed by 3% that is, there is much more competition within groups than between them which argues against the resource defense model there is not as neat a correlation between sociality and resource patchiness as we might hope many highly social primates are folivores, which eat leaves that are not very patchy in their distribution frugivorous primates, which should be most strongly affected by the need for resource defense, span the whole range from social to solitary Predation theory: being in a group offers better protection from predators evidence that supports the predation theory terrestrial primates tend to live in bigger groups than arboreal ones presumably because there are more predatory threats on the ground many of the primate species that are less social are large, most able to defend themselves some primates adjust their sociality (group size) to the degree of predator threat macaques on predator-free islands form smaller groups than those on the mainland, where predation is more of a threat weaknesses in the predation theory predation events are rarely observed, so it is hard to assess the actual threat there is no clear association of predation losses with group size that is, the predation theory suggests that we should see more predation losses among primates that live in social groups, because the social groups are a response to that threat but there is no \nevidence that larger groups suffer higher predation losses of course, this may be because sociality is effective at preventing predation losses both theories probably have some role they are not mutually exclusive group size has to balance costs and benefits benefits to living in larger groups: larger groups can better defend resource patches larger groups can better resist predators costs to living in larger groups members of larger groups suffer from more competition from others within their own group members of larger groups are exposed

(chaos) &#151;the magnitude, period and direction of the changes may fluctuate cyclic dynamics (i.e., damped oscillations and stable limit cycles) can be easily produced by adding a time lag into density dependence: make per capita growth rate ( r ) depend on N at some time in past negative effects of intraspecific competition felt at a later time biologically realistic&#151;due to a time lag between the acquisition of resources and the production/release of eggs/offspring &#151;so, the number of offspring produced when the population reaches K may actually have been set some time before when N was still below K , etc. chaos does not imply random variations&#151;simply that fluctuations are unpredictable: most often seen in species with large reproductive potential ( r large) and strong density-dependent changes in mortality and fecundity in part due to non-linearities in effects of environment on survivorship and fecundity &#151; slight differences in initial conditions can produce large differences in final population sizes (like the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; in weather forcasting) C. Key Factor Analysis we often wish to know the specific cause(s) of observed fluctuations in the size/density of populations in the field &#151; this can point to ways of controlling pests or increasing the numbers of endangered species, for example one method that has been applied here is key factor analysis &#151; first applied to study of univoltine (&quot;annual&quot;) insects (spruce budworm) by Morris (1957) construct a life table for each year &#151; use stages (adult, egg, larva, pupa, adult) instead of age classes: calculate k values for each life stage transition &#151; k = instantaneous mortality coefficient: k = log(N s ) - log(N e ) where k = instantaneous mortality coefficient N s = number of individuals starting the stage N e = number of individuals ending the stage for example, 83.0 individuals (per m 2 ) entered the pupal stage in 1955 &#151; 54.6 were killed by pupal predators (shrews, mice and beetles) during late summer, leaving only 28.4 per m 2 : k 5 = log(83.0) - log(28.4) = 0.47 we can then plot overall mortality along with all of the &quot;component&quot; mortalities, and look for those that are most responsible for the observed pattern &#151; i.e., look for the key factors in this case, winter disappearance is the key factor causing the major fluctuations in population size we can also plot the k values for different years against the population density at each time to look for density-dependence in the various mortalities: here winter disappearance is density-independent, but pupal predation (increases with density) and mortality due to other parasites (decreases with density) are both density-dependent D. Experimental Manipulations besides key factor analysis, another method of determining which factor(s) determine or limit population size is to experimentally manipulate suspected factors and observe the effects on \npopulation size: e.g., you can experimentally reduce or increase the numbers of predators, competitors, parasites, food organisms, etc. provides stronger evidence than simple correlations between environmental factors and population size in unmanipulated populations some factors are hard to regulate (e.g., weather), but you can still make predictions about the outcome of a cold spring on deer population size, for example Last Updated: Wednesday, November 18, 2000 Contact: Dr. David J.
