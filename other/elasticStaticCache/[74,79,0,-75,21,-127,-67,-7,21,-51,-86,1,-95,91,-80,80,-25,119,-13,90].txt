extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles -
