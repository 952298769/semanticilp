[["Taken from Mary Applehot's ' Worms Eat My Garbage' A. Build the container - select the material: plastic or wood - determine the size: I' x 2' x 3' = family of 4-6 ---people, 2' x 2' x 8' = 2 people - drill 12 small holes in bottom for aeration/drainage - cover with a black plastic sheet to keep light out and moisture in - place a large sheet of plastic underneath the container - put box in any convenient place where temperature = 55 -77 degrees F. - do not place in direct sunlight B. Select bedding material - shredded corrugated cartons - shredded newspaper/computer paper animal manure decaying leaves - peat moss may be added to any of the above C. Prepare bedding - add water to the bedding at a 3:1 ratio - mix together in a large container - add 2 handfuls of soil - dump into worm box D. Add worms - only redworms may be used (redworms like to eat garbage) - purchase through: mail-order catalogues (e.g. Cape Cod Worm Farm 508-759-5664), - local bait stores, organic gardening magazines - keep a 2:1 ratio of worms (lbs.) to garbage/per day (lbs.) - add worms as needed - place cover on top of container 5-15 minutes after adding worms E. Add your garbage - bury garbage 1-2' under bedding on a convenient basis (weekly, bi-weekly, or whatever meetsyour needs) - keep a record of how much was buried and where add: a) all vegetable and fruit scraps b) coffee grinds and tea leaves/bags c) moldy cheese and egg shells d) spoiled food (i.e. baked beans, spaghetti) do not add: a) meat products (these products attract rodents and become smelly) b) plastic, metal, or glass items (worms do not eat these products c) rubber bands or aluminum foil d) pet urine/feces F.
