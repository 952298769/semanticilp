Ecology of Echinoderms Ancient group of marine animals, well-represented in fossil record Name means \"spiny skin\" fig 41.33 Examples: sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea

canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple

external Sexes are separate, but difficult to distinguish externally Develop into free-swimming, bilaterally symmetrical larvae fig 41.35 Significantly different from annelid/mollusk trochophore

prominent and set off from the disk, generally five in number Mouth located in center of the lower surface Often feed on bivalve mollusks fig 41.37 Sexes separate, external fertilization Females may brood young Class Ophiuroidea: the brittle stars fig 41.33d Slender arms more sharply set off from central disk than sea stars Move by active movement of their arms along the substrate Capture suspended particles with tube feet, long spines or arms Arms detach readily, helping protect animals from predators Class Echinoidea: the sea urchins and sand dollars fig 41.33e,f Lack distinct arms, but retain familiar five-part body plan Five rows of tube feet protrude through plates of the skeleton Skeletons are made up of fused calcareous plates Walk along substrate with tube feet or movement

amount of yolk, and the young hatch at a later stage of development - macrolecithal eggs (characteristic of fishes, reptiles, birds and monotremes) have a large amount of yolk, and the young hatch at

vitelline membrane surrounding the egg to prevent more than one sperm from penetrating the egg ( polyspermy ), the egg undergoes a cortical reaction to bring the sperm head into the interior of the egg and change the vitelline envelope to form the fertilization membrane Just after fertilization the zygote (fertilized egg) undergoes cleavage (mitotic cell divisions) and becomes subdivided into smaller cells - the gross arrangement of cells differs greatly among vertebrates, depending on the amount of yolk in the egg: Holoblastic cleavage occurs when the cleavage furrows pass through the entire egg cleavage can either be equal, where the resulting cells contain the same amount of yolk, or unequal, in which some cells contain more yolk than others: - equal cleavage occurs in microlecithal eggs - unequal cleavage occurs in mesolecithal eggs cleavage results in the formation of a ball of cells ( blastomeres ) surrounding an internal cavity ( blastocoel ) Meroblastic cleavage occurs more in macrolecithal eggs cleavage takes place only in a disk at the animal pole the cleavage furrows do not extend into the yolk results in the formation of the blastodisk that lies
