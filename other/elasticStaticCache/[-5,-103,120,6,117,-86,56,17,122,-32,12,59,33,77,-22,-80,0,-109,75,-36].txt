First, the flying animal has access to food sources unavailable to terrestrial species. This includes insects flying above the ground level that cannot be reached by earthbound animals as well as fruits and flowers on the terminal ends of thin branches. Second, the flier has a ready means of escape from non-flying (or non-volant) predators and can rest in places that are not accessible to earthbound predators. Third, flight gives a species great mobility and the ability to cover large expanses rapidly and cheaply. Although the amount of energy required to initiate flight is great, once the animal is airborne, flying is the most economical form of locomotion per distance traveled in a terrestrial environment. In addition to daily foraging advantages, flight provides the means to compensate for seasonal changes in climate and food availability. A fourth advantage is at the evolutionary level. Fliers can overcome geographic barriers such as large bodies of water and, consequently, can disperse to locations not easily traversed by non-volant terrestrial animals. For example, bats are the only mammals native to New Zealand, to many remote Pacific Islands, and to the Azores in the Atlantic. Before humans arrived on Australia with dogs, bats and a few rodents (apparently arriving from New Guinea) were the only eutherian mammals among all the terrestrial fauna on the continent.",1.1251957416534424],["X1013071371-00104-28722</DOCNO> Amazing Rainforest Animals Amazing Rainforest Animals Fruit Bat The Fruit Bat by Louise Crawford I dreamed I was a fruit bat Flying high over the night-noisy rainforest Swooping down on tree ripened papayas Reforesting Fruit Bat Links Did you know?",1.1208739280700684],["Bats roost in trees, caves, mines and barns — anyplace that provides shelter from the weather, protection from predators and seclusion for rearing the animals' young.

The energy from food is allocated to different functions such as maintenance of homeostasis (i.e. temperature), reproduction, exchange mechanisms, maintenance of tone and locomotion. As most bats are small and therefore have a large surface area per unit volume, they have trouble maintaining their body temperature high and constant as consequence of the significant energy loss through the skin. Moreover, flight requires high energy expenditure, especially since many bats are exposed to cold nights and fly at high altitudes with low oxygen partial pressures ( Harrison & Roberts 2000 ). In this sense bats may be considered as mammals adapted to extreme environments where oxygen management is crucial. Both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems undergo changes or refinements that allow them to optimize the acquisition and delivery of oxygen to tissues, and thus survive this extreme way of life.",1.1114110946655273],["The animals that help in pollination arebeatles,butterflies,girrafes,bats,wosps,bees,flies and more which I think Iforgot.",1.1089695692062378],["The animals that help in pollination arebeatles,butterflies,girrafes,bats,wosps,bees,flies and more which I think Iforgot.",1.1089695692062378],["If you are very lucky, you might spot wild animals such as flying lemurs, bats even snakes which inhabit the forests.",1.1089695692062378],["One significant reason for this is that bats are small, nocturnal, silent, flying animals, which makes it extremely difficult to study them.",1.1089695692062378],["Since it is the only animal which both nurses its young and flies, the bat is symbolic of motherhood.",1.1089695692062378],["Other definitions are so misleadingly simple as to be alarmist (\"a small animal that flies at night\" = bat ) or downright dangerous (\"red spots on the skin\" = rash ).",1.0984617471694946],["The Origin of Fire, The Ballgame between the Animals and the Birds , Why Mole lives underground (a love story), Why Bat flies at night, and four more wonderful stories.",1.0984617471694946],["The Origin of Fire, The Ballagame between the Animals and the Birds , Why Mole lives underground (a love story), Why Bat flies at night, and four more wonderful stories.",1.0984617471694946],["The Bat-Poet (1963), The Animal Family (1965), dedicated to the Jarrell's cat, Elfi, and Fly By Night (published posthumously in 1976) all were illustrated by Maurice Sendak.",1.0984617471694946],["The in-game world has a dynamic environment which features a realistic day-night cycle, seasonal changes and weather conditions including snow and rain.",1.0970561504364014],["Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground).",1.0963397026062012],["I wondered what risk trimming would pose to these animals, especially to bats during the spring maternity season when pups are not yet able to fly.",1.096171498298645],["An example of coevolution is between bats and moths.
