[["Explanation: Light from the sun is made up of a mixture of many different colors of light, even though to the eye the light looks almost white. A prism can be used to separate white light into the colors that make it up. Color is how we perceive the energy of light. All the colors of the rainbow are light of different energies. Red light has the lowest energy and violet light has the highest energy. An object appears red because the red light waves are reflected. This means that all the other colors are absorbed. Similar to a color filter. A red filter over a flashlight lens allows only the red light wave to pass through and absorbs all the other colors. White is a reflection of all the colors and black is the absence of color, so all the colors are being absorbed. This is why a white shirt feels cooler on a hot summer day than a black shirt.",1.7651753425598145],["However, a white color will reflect most UV rays from the sun (most of the energy from sunlight is

in the telescope chapter ). Also recall from the light chapter that hotter dense things produce more energy (they are brighter). With more solar energy flowing to the closer planets, they must be hotter to re-radiate that energy back out to space. The amount of solar energy reflected immediately out to space is determined by the material on the planet's surface or clouds in the atmosphere. The fraction of sunlight that is reflected from an object is the albedo. If the albedo is closer to 1 (100% reflectivity), the planet does not need to be as hot to have its outflow of energy balance the inflow of solar energy. Darker objects absorb more solar energy and, therefore, they need to heat up more to re-radiate that energy back out to balance the inflow of solar energy.
