the susceptibility of igneous rocks reflects the order of crystallization given in BRS: 1) rate of weathering corresponds to the minerals position on the BRS (olivine - first and quartz - last) 2) rocks are aggregates of minerals, rocks with minerals higher in the BRS weather first 4 Page 5 WEATHERING AND SOILS TYPES OF WEATHERING 1) Mechanical or Physical weathering - disintegration or fragmentation of rocks involving no change in the mineralogical composition of the rocks 2) Chemical Weathering - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals 5 Page 6 WEATHERING AND SOILS WEATHERING PROCESSES Mechanical Weathering - breaks rock into smaller fragments that retain the characteristics of the original rock - do not change the mineralogical composition of the rock - exposes more surface area (increases the surface area to volume ratio) of rock for subsequent chemical attack 6 Page 7 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) FROST ACTION -

Frost wedging - Frost wedging results from alternate freezing and thawing of water in cracks within rocks - as water freezes, volume increases by 9% -expansion exerts a force that is great enough to break the rocks 8 Page 9 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION - Frost wedging Requirements 1) pre-existing cracks or voids in rocks 2) adequate moisture (water) 3) temperature rises and falls below the freezing point of water - common in temperate climates, and high mountains in tropical regions 9 Page 10 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES FROST ACTION -
