The mutations are slowed down through the mating process. According to Ridley, an individual encounters two problems when attempting to assess the gene quality of another individual. “One is how to tell which suitors have good genes, and which have bad” (Ridley, 2000). Zoologist Peter Garson studied the European wren and discovered males who spend much of their time displaying and building nests are the most successful in being chosen by the female wren. “Data collected in one of two years suggested that individual females may show a preference for males with the largest number of complete but vacant nests” (Garson, 1980). The males that are successful in nest building are at top of the selection pool allowing their genes to move forward and be passed on. This is a proactive experience in which time and effort put into nest building will give the female wren confidence in the male, which ultimately makes courtship and reproduction possible. In addition, this also eliminates mutations from occurring slowing down the gene evolving process. More so for humans then animals, Ridley says “the second problem is that, during courtship, you are accompanied by the equivalent of a smooth-talking salesperson” (Ridley, 2000). A courting male may not portray his defects to the female because his primary interest is to use his better attributes to win the challenge at hand. A reference can be made back to the odd behavior that males show.

Woodrats are considered generalists in habitat and diet, yet a steady decline in natural stick nests and capture rates over the past several decades suggests that they are limited by the availability of nesting habitat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The more specialized Key Largo cotton mouse appears to rely on old growth hammock, a habitat type that is rare following past land clearing. In 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service started building supplemental nest structures to restore habitat quality and connectivity for these endangered rodents, but nest use requires evaluation. We used camera traps and occupancy models to evaluate the factors influencing woodrat and cotton mouse use of the supplemental nests. We detected woodrats at 65 and cotton mice at 175 of 284 sampled nest structures, with co-occurrence at 38 nests. Woodrat nest use followed a gradient from low nest use in the north to high nest use in the south, which might relate to the proximity of free-ranging domestic cat (</span><i>Felis catus</i><span>) colonies in residential developments. Cotton mouse nest use, however, was related positively to mature hammock and related negatively to disturbed areas (e.g. scarified lands). The two species occurred independently of each other. Stick-stacking behavior was observed at supplemental nests and, although it was correlated with detection of woodrats, it was not a strong predictor of their occurrence.

Other kinds of cells, such as neutrophils and intestinal cells in vertebrates, turn over rapidly. Even individual cells of a particular type may survive for different lengths of time depending on other events. For example, mammalian T lymphocytes are formed in the thymus. Within the thymus, 95 percent of such cells die rapidly, within two or three days of their formation, unless they are selected by the thymus because of a particular specificity of their receptor for antigen. Successfully selected cells are released by the thymes and migrate to other parts of the body, where they become part of the large pool of T lymphocytes in the animal, responsible for fighting off infections. Even there, these cells have a relatively short half-life- less than a week-unless they encounter an antigen to which their receptors can bind. If this happens, the T lymphocyte divides and produces various hormonelike factors (lymphokines), which stimulate the B cells (antibody-producing cells) to divide and help rid the animal of the invading antigen. Once the invader is destroyed some of Be progeny of the once-dividing T lymphocyte become \"memory cells\"; they stop dividing and producing lymphokines, but they survive in He animal more or less indefinitely, with a life-span approximately that of the individual itself. By this means the immune system builds up a pool of long-lived T lymphocytes, which are useful in fighting off the types of infections that its host will encounter during life. A single encounter with an antigen, and burst of cell division, changes the life expectancy of the human T cell, without any further cell division, from less than a week to more than 10 years. SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN PLANT DEVELOPMENT Plants and Animals Share Many Structures and Developmental Mechanisms, But There Are Some Major Differences The fast and most obvious difference between plant and animal development is that plant development is usually repetitive in nature and indefinitely long. A tip of a maple twig will put out pairs of leaves all season long and then again the following year. Roots are less periodic in structure, but they too grow and branch indefinitely. The plant body is basically the accumulation of the products of its past developmental activity. Many of the cells remain alive. By design, however, many do not, resulting in the accumulation of wood and bark. Occupying ever more volume and intercepting ever more light is obviously a key strategy of high adaptive significance for plants. This strategy is generally implemented by having the tip regions elongate in length indefinitely, a process called primary growth. Subterminal regions stop elongating and, in perennials, increase in girth at their periphery, while producing dead but functional wood cells toward the interior of the stem or root.
