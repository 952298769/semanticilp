If you eat meat, the organisms you are eating are animals, and those animals probably ate plants, or ate other organisms that ate plants. For example, cows eat plants like grass and corn. Chickens eat plants and insects and worms. Those insects and worms got their food from plants, or from other insects and bacteria that ate plants. This is called a food chain, and it allows you to figure out the source of all your food. Write down a list of everything you ate for lunch and figure out where that food came from. (You may need to get help from your teacher to do this.) For example, if you had a hamburger and fries: the bread in the bun was made of flour, which comes from plants. The beef came from cows, which eat plants. The lettuce, onions and tomatoes came from plants. The fries are potatoes, which are plants. If you had a Coke with it, the sugar in the Coke came from plants. If you do this, you'll soon realize that the ultimate source of ALL food is plants. How can plants make their own food? They are able to use the energy in sunlight to make food from gas in the atmosphere and water and nutrients in the soil. This is a process called \"photosynthesis\", which means \"to make food\" \"from sunlight\". It's pretty amazing, when you think about it, but it means that plants cannot live without sunlight.
