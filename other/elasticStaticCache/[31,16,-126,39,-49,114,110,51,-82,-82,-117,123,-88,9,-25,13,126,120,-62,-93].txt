totaly or just till it up when you till you can go thru and pick up the bigger clumps of grass and put them in a compost pile after the garden is tilled and raked up a bit you can decide what and where to plant depending on how your garden is laid out and how many is in your family you can plant plant your taller crops like corn sunflowers etc. towards the south that way the others get some shade from the afternoon sun i usually buy starts of the longer growing plants that is the ones that need a long time till maturity like tomatoes,watermelons,cantelope, things like the lettuce,carrots,beans,peas,can be planted right in the garden as soon as its gets warm i usually buy plants of most the vegetables to put in you can start seeds but since this is your first garden stick with plants but like mentioned earlier the lettuce,beans,peas,corn,turnips,radishes,beets etc.use seeds if your not sure to get plants or use seeds ask your local garden center or nursery they
