typical bird and how these organ systems function understand what avian anatomical modifications are adaptations to flight understand the mechanisms of flight and specializations for other kinds of locomotion (walking, swimming) understand thermoregulation in birds understand photoperiodism, migration, and orientation in birds know the difference between ultimate and proximate factors in establishing timing of migration, breeding, etc understand basic bird behavior, including that related to feeding, breeding, and social interactions understand avian breeding biology from initiation of territoriality (in the species which exhibit it) through pair formation and raising of young get a basic understanding of population regulation of birds know bird topography, general avian feather tract patterns, feather types, feather structure, and how feather colors are determined know the avian skeleton, and its compnent parts, and know what skeletal modifications are adaptations for flight know the anatomy of the pigeon and what departures from the general vertebrate pattern are peculiar to birds and which ones are adaptive to a flying vertebrate be able to identify study skins of about 200 Pennsylvania bird species know sex, age, and seasonal differences in plumage where these exist know the higher taxonomic categories to which the specimens belong and understand what these reveal about the relationships between the birds and their relationships to other animals be able to identify by sight many of the bird species present in western Pennsylvania know how to identify some western Pennsylvania species by call or song learn the habitat requirements and behavioral patterns of many western Pennsylvania species learn to observe birds carefully, accurately, and in detail (as evidence of this ability the student will keep a field notebook and hand in field notes) the student will select a topic on some aspect of avian biology, carry out a field project, and write a
