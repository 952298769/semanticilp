electrical energy can be transformed into other forms of energy describe how scientific developments have influenced energy use through the ages Earth and Space Science (Astronomy) It is expected that students will: identify characteristics of known objects outside the solar system outline the changes in human understanding of the universe from early times to the present illustrate the seasonal position of various constellations Earth and Space Science (Earth's Crust) It is expected that students will: identify changes that occur to the Earth's surface due to earthquakes and volcanoes
