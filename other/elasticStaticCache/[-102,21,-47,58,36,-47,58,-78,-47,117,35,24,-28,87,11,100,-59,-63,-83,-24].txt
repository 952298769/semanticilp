[["Plants have many ways to disperse their seeds wind dispersal seeds may be dustlike, weighing almost nothing seeds may possess plumes that help make them buoyant seeds may possess wings that increase the seed s surface area and the likelihood that the seed can be blown away by the wind water dispersal seeds may contian abundant air-filled spaces that increase their buoyancy seeds may have a thick seed coat that keeps them from getting waterlogged animal dispersal seeds may have spines or hooks that help them adhere to fur or feathers C] FRUITS - GREEN VS. RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",0.9986663460731506],["The aspartame

radiation or high latitudes Regulation of Vitamin D synthesis Frost bite sensitivity and cold tolerance Regulation of Vitamin D synthesis Vitamin D in the body is derived primarily from the skin and secondarily from the diet Vitamin D is synthesized in skin by the action of UV-B Precursor molecule is 7-DHC or 7-dehydrocholesterol, which occurs in the strata granulosum and basale of the epidermis UV-B exposure causes a photochemical (non-enzymatic) conversion of 7-DHC into previtamin D High melanin content in skin reduces UV-B exposure and cuts photochemical conversion Previtamin D is transformed into vitamin D by a temperature dependent process over 2-3 days Vitamin D then diffuses into the blood vessels of the dermis The liver and kidney further transform the Vitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D which is the most active form of the vitamin The function of Vitamin D is to actively cause calcium absorption across the wall of the small intestine into the blood stream Calcium is used for bone and tooth development as well as for nervous and muscle action The skeleton serves as a calcium reservoir If calcium levels in intracellular fluid drops, hormones are released to cause resorption of bone, placing calcium into circulation A deficiency of Vitamin D in infants and children causes Rickets, in adults a deficiency causes osteomalacia Rickets refers to a defect in the calcification of growing bone so that the bones are structurally weak and unable to withstand mechanical pressure Bones become deformed, impairing locomotion Pelvic distortion can make childbearing dangerous--potentially killing mother and baby Assuming that our ancestors had dark skin in the tropics, as hominids moved into higher latitudes there would have been substantial
