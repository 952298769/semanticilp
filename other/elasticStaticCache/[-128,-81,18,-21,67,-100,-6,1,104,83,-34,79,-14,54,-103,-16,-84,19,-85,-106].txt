a single species now imagine that a different species of bird also lives on the island it has a long, narrow beak and a long tongue suited for picking insects out of tree bark the two species of birds share the island, but do not mate with each other: they are reproductively isolated from each other no matter how useful it might be to have a long, narrow beak and tongue and eat insects, the finches will never get these traits from the bug-eating birds the gap between the two species remains clear the finches remain finches, and the bug-eaters remain bug-eaters because they are reproductively isolated from each other the point of the example according to the biological species concept, it is gene flow within the species that keeps all members of the species fairly similar and it is reproductive isolation from other species that allows each species to be different from all others, because no mixing between species occurs a note about reproductive isolation populations may be reproductively isolated in many different, often subtle ways in the most obvious case, they may be so different that they physically cannot mate, or that even if they do, the offspring do not survive or are not fertile but isolation is just as complete if they simply do not mate for some other reason for example, if one population is active in the day, and the other at night or if two populations of birds develop preferences for different colors of feathers, and the birds only choose mates of their own type even though they could be made to successfully mate in a lab or on a farm, if they do not mate in nature, they are effectively isolated The ecological species concept \"A species is a group of organisms that is genetically distinct from other species because any hybrids between species are markedly less successful\" This is a much less common, somewhat radical view but it is worth looking at The ecological species concept says that what keeps all the members of the species similar to each other is not gene flow, but rather stabilizing selection because the selective pressures that created the species in the first place will tend to keep each population the same (stabilizing selection) that is, even if a species is divided into physically isolated populations and there is no gene flow between them, the two populations will still remain the same because they are experiencing the same stabilizing selection pressures the species remain different from other species because if individuals from two different species do successfully mate and produce offspring the offspring will have a mixture of traits that will be less well adapted.",1.0467042922973633],["The human rights situation remains precarious in the Georgian-populated areas of the Gali district.",1.0466420650482178],["The situation was the same in some Bosniak-controlled areas, for example in Bugojno, to which Croats were not allowed to return.",1.0462048053741455],["Such situations include those where: (a) internally displaced populations are present in or returning to the same areas as repatriating refugees, or areas to which refugees are expected to return;",1.0374152660369873],["Knowledge of the basic ecology of populations (groups of individuals of the same species), communities (all the populations occurring in a given area), and ecosystems (communities and the physical environments with which they interact), is necessary to understand the magnitude and significance of the ecological changes produced by the growing human population.",1.0314134359359741],["Ecological populations, for example, have niches;",1.0172499418258667],["Ecological populations, for example, have niches;",1.0172499418258667],["competition: the situation in which two populations occupy the same or parts of the same niche.",1.0077855587005615],["It is clear this ever-growing population is heading toward a major ecological disaster, which may include extensive areas of fragile \narctic breeding habitat and affect all wildlife that depends on these same areas.",0.9968924522399902],["It is clear this ever-growing population is heading toward a major ecological disaster, which may include extensive areas of fragile arctic breeding habitat and affect all wildlife \nthat depends on these same areas.",0.9968924522399902],["Tolkien didn't believe in progress -
