due to the shrinking of the cytoplasm during the fixing process - Stratum Granulosum - &quot;grainy layer&quot; - cells start accumulating granules of keratin - superior to stratum spinosum - 2-5 layers of semi-flattened cells - cells begin to die here - Stratum Lucidum - thin, &quot;clear&quot; strata superior to the stratum granulosum - dead cells are surrounded by keratin fibers - only found in thick skin (palms /soles) - Stratum Corneum - most superficial layer of epidermis - 25 or more layers of cornifiied cells - dead cells with a hard envelope of keratin proteins Accessory Skin Structures Hair - dead, keratinized epithelial cells arranged in three concentric layers - divided into the shaft (above skin) and the root (below the skin) - attached to arrector-pili muscles - smooth muscle that elevates hair in response to cold or fear Sebaceous (Oil) Glands - located in the dermis - connected by a duct to the hair follicle - secrete oil to protect the skin from drying out and protect against bacteria Sweat (Sudoriferous) Glands - there are two types of Sudoriferous glands - Apocrine Glands - found in armpits and around genitals - secrete compounds converted by bacteria to form body odor - possibly for chemical communication - Merocrine Glands - most common type of sweat gland - coiled gland deep in the dermis - evaporative cooling Nails - protect the end of the digit - composed of dead, tightly compressed keratinized cells - produced by the nail root - proximal region, close to the bone of the digit - covered with skin - the cuticle, is the stratum corneum of the nail root - the nail body covers the nail bed Cell Connections (from chapter 4) - mechanically bind cells together - help form a permeability barrier provide a mechanism for intercellular communication 1.",1.1435246467590332],["Following fertilization, the zygote undergoes an asymmetrical cell division that gives rise to a small apical cell, which becomes the embryo and a large basal cell (called the suspensor), which functions to provide nutrients from the endosperm to the growing embryo.",1.1431647539138794],["The Nutricell Complex Set (Nutricell C-Complex packaged along with the Nutricell Gel) has been shown to increase the &quot;plumping&quot;
