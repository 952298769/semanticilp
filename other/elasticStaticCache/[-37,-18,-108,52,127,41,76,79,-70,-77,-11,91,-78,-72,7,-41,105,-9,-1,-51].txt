structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up main sequence Common type of star in our Galaxy is faint, cool, M-type star, Known as red dwarf Presumably also true for other galaxies, but too faint to prove Mass-Luminosity Relation for Main-Sequence Stars From orbital motion of binary stars, astronomers able to estimate masses of component stars in binary system Observed

Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and red supergiants White

less than about 1.4 M sun Radii a few hundredths of Sun's (700,000 km) making them about size of Earth (7,000 km) Consequently, white dwarfs must have mean densities on order of millions of g/cm 3
