and use this scheme as a tool to organize information about the diversity of life forms &#149;Describe/identify random differences between individuals of the same species of plant or animal, e.g. students can examine parts of plants of the same species and recognize variations, and can construct graphs and charts showing the variations &#149;Describe/identify similarities and differences among multiple offspring of same parents, and between parents and offspring &#149;Collect data on inherited characteristics and use the data to explain how traits are passed from generation to generation &#149;Identify major body structures of some common organisms, e.g. when shown a picture of the human skeleton students can identify, by common name, the major bones in their body &#149;Relate the structure of body parts to function, e.g. when presented with teeth (or models of teeth) from various animals, students can make inferences concerning what the animal eats &#149;Create examples of food chains and webs in several types of ecosystems, e.g. deciduous forest, fresh water, desert, etc. End of Grade 10 (Secondary) Students will be able to: &#149;Identify and give examples of representative life forms in the five kingdoms (see curriculum standard 3d) of living things &#149;Identify and describe similarities and differences among organisms of different, but closely related taxa (groups), e.g. conifers, rodents, big cats, etc. &#149;Relate different kinds of animals and plants to their habitat by observing their physical characteristics &#149;Interpret simple genetic crosses and predict/explain the patterns that emerge &#149;Explain how the characteristics of living things depends upon genes &#149;Estimate the degree of kinship among organisms or species, e.g. from the similarity of their DNA base-pair sequences, anatomy, physiology, or behavior &#149;Develop appropriate food webs for the major biomes of the earth and accurately describe the major
