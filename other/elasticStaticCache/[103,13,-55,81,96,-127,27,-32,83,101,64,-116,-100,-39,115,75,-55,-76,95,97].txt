- rectangular faces &quot;Subangular blocky&quot; - irregular faces Prism-like structure Soil aggregates into columns taller than wide Often seen in subsurface horizons &quot;Prismatic&quot; - level tops &quot;Columnar&quot;

PD because air and water have lower density than soil solids Amount of porespace is major determinant of bulk density More porespace produces lower density BD generally lower in finer than coarser textured soils Better structure in former produce more PS More but smaller pores Finer-textured soils, however, can often be compacted more severely than coarser-textured ones Smaller particles can be packed more closely BD generally varies - 1.0-1.5 g/cc in most soils BD can be increased abnormally by trafficking Squeezes out porespace BD can be increased by land clearing or tillage Removes OM, physically or by oxidation Destroys aggregation BD generally increases with depth Less OM deeper in profile Less mechanical activity to promote structure Weight of overlying soil compresses that below WEIGHT OF SOIL IN THE FIELD 1 ACRE FURROW SLICE = 2 MILLION POUNDS 1 ACRE = 43560 SQUARE FEET CORRECTLY 6 2/3 INCHES DEEP IN OHIO Porespace in soils Created by Incomplete interlocking of soil particles Spaces between structural units and aggregates Root and soil animal channels Micropores - retain water against gravity Macropores - allow water to flow freely Coarse textured soils dominated by macropores Fine textured soils (clays) dominated by micropores Good soils have a balance of both Compaction by excessive loads often results in increase in micropore space and loss of macropore space Larger pores squeezed out Air exchange reduced Water movement slowed considerably More runoff Less infiltration Slower drainage of excess water in soil A mix of pore sizes assures retention of adequate water for plant growth but also allows for drainage of excess A continuous pore system allows more thorough aeration, wetting and drainage than one with equal pore volume but dominated by dead ends Maintaining good soil structure - TILTH Active program - organic Adequate and timely additions of decomposible OM Proper environment for decomposition - drainage Timely soil mixing and manipulation Active program - mechanical Avoiding field operations when wet Minimizing trips and loads Subsoiling - when dry Passive program Resting the soil Multi-year sod crops WATER IN THE SOIL Water is a polar molecule Cohesion - hydrogen bonding Adhesion - adsorption onto negatively charged clay particles and other surfaces Dissolves many salts and some non-polar compounds Does not dissolve many organic compounds Participates in many chemical reactions at ambient temperatures Water expands when it freezes Soil water relationships are based in large part on pore size and geometry Water retention and removal Water movement Types of water in soils Hygroscopic - bound very tightly to particles;",1.0375070571899414],["= flaccid, so stomata close (K+ and H2O leaves cells) Early Explanations for Transpiration: Grew - thought that xylem (vessels &amp; tracheids) pumped the water along through the plant Malpighi - suggested that capillary action moved the water up through the plant Hales - discovered root pressure, which is noticeable when plants are pruned and water exits through the cut ends, this is due to root pressure by osmosis and other forces identified a pulling force due to evaporation of water through leaves and stems Today's Explanation: Cohesion-Tension Theory - H2O molecules are polar and due to these negatively and positively charged ends, H2O molecules are able to hydrogen bond (or cohere) to one another and adhere to capillary walls permitting an amount of tension as water transpires, a &quot;pull&quot;
