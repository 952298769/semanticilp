Inherited characteristics are called traits. Offspring frequently look like their parents, and they also have the same instincts. Each parent passes on some of its traits to the offspring, so that the offspring have some traits that match one or both parents. Some human examples of inherited traits are eye color, hair color and the ability to roll one’s tongue. Sometimes the offspring look different from their parents or from the other young. They may even act differently.

In the population of pea plants grown at the monastery, there was rather little genetic variation; each of the traits he studied had only two versions. This probably reflects the fact that a single pea plant can pollinate its own flowers, so all of the offspring from that plant carry only the two alleles of the parent plant.
