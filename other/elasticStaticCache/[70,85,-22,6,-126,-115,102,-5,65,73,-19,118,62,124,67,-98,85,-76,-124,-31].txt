Explain the global impacts of human changes in the physical environment, as exemplified by being able to Describe the spatial consequences, deliberate and inadvertent, of human activities that have global implications (e.g., the dispersal of animal and plant species worldwide increases in runoff and sediment, tropical soil degradation, habitat destruction, air pollution, alterations in the hydrologic cycle) Identify and debate the positive and negative aspects of landscape changes in the students local community and region that relate to peoples changing attitudes toward the environment (e.g., pressure to replace farmlands with wetlands in floodplain areas, interest in preserving wilderness areas, support of the concept of historic preservation) Examine the characteristics of major global environmental changes and assess whether the changes are a result of human action, natural causes, or a conmbination of both factors (e.g., increases in world temperatures attributable to major global action, the link between changes in solar emissions and amounts of volcanic dust in the atmosphere attributable to natural causes) C.
