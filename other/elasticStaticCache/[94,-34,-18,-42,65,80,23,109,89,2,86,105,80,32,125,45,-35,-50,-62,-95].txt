expected that students will: relate the structure and behaviour of local organisms to their survival in local environments discuss how changes in an organism's habitat can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species give examples of how the differences in individuals of the same species may give an advantage in surviving and reproducing relate the growth and survival of
