[["To distinguish instinctive from learned behavior, Spalding (1872, 1873) designed an extraordinary series of experiments in which he systematically manipulated an animal's experience (e.g., by placing hoods over the eyes of chicks still in the shell and only unhooding them several days after hatching) and carefully recorded relevant behaviors (e.g., the chick's first visually guided pecking movements), thereby providing a model for use of the experimental method in the study of behavior (see Gray, 1962, for an excellent discussion of Spalding's contributions).",1.296399712562561],["Thus, chicks, which possess the instinctive tendency to peck at food, are said to suppress this tendency when bad-tasting food is given them.",0.9097532629966736],["There is an immense amount of instinctive behavior -- they areready to fly and when they hatch.",0.7820597290992737]]
