measures the strength of an earthquake (the amount of energy released) 20 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE Earthquake Magnitude Richter Scale - magnitude of an earthquake is determined from measurement of the amplitude of the surface waves - the Richter Scale is Logarithmic to accommodate a wide variation in earthquake magnitudes 21 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE The Richter Scale 1) there is a tenfold increase in wave amplitude corresponding to an increase of one unit on the magnitude scale e.g. 4.5 - 5.5 implies 5.5 has 10 times 4.5 amplitude 2) there is a 32-fold increase in the amount of energy released for each unit increase in the magnitude scale e.g. 6.0 - 7.0 implies 7.0 has 32 times more energy 22 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The nature of earthquake destruction depends on: 1) magnitude of the earthquake 2) rock type 3) proximity to population centers 23 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The amount of structural damage attributable to vibration from earthquakes depend on: 1) the intensity and duration of the vibrations (e.g. Anchorage vs San Francisco) 2) the nature of the material upon which the structures rests - ground motion amplification (e.g. lake bed sediments, Mexico City 1985) 3) the design of the structure (e.g. Armenia) 24 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES OTHER EARTHQUAKE
