organic debris into the sediment as muck and the water column as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds aided by low dissolved oxygen levels Nutrients cycle into aquatic plant and algae growth Natural decay of aquatic plants and algae recycle nutrients back into the sediment and \nwater column starting the cycle over The Pond Cycle-Unmanaged: Excessive nutrients cause excessive aquatic vegetation and increased soft sediment ( muck ) build-up Seasonal and diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen levels increase anaerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface allowing increased leaching of soluble phosphorus from organic sediment Functional and aesthetic value of the water body declines interfering with intended use Managing the Pond Cycle: Manage the watershed to prevent additional organic matter from entering pond Control existing excessive growth Prevent recurrence of algae blooms and/or submersed vegetation infestations Reduce the nutrients stored in sediment through accelerated organic break down by adding specific enzymes Augment existing pond bacteria to enhance and increase organic breakdown Increase the efficiency of organic sediment break-down, reduce leaching of phosphorus from the sediment and eliminate stagnation by providing effective aeration Applied Biochemists 5-Point Approach: Effectively control existing algae growth with Cutrine Plus and/or weed growth with an EPA registered aquatic herbicide giving immediate relief for functional use and aesthetics Prevent re-growth of aquatic vegetation in waters over 3 feet deep while enhancing aesthetics by using Aquashade Rapidly digest organic materials associated with algae mucilage or dead vegetative materials by adding AQUA-PREP , a specific blend of high-quality enzymes and non-ionic surfactants, making nutrients immediately available to the naturally occurring pond bacteria Augment the existing pond bacteria population by adding NUTRI-SORB , a high-quality blend of gram-negative, naturally occurring bacteria designed to breakdown a broad spectrum of organic wastes Accelerate aerobic decay of organic material in the pond while eliminating stagnation using MixAirTech s line of

areas and prevent organic debris from entering pond Restrict nutrient influx Keep fertilizer use away from any area that drains, slopes or potentially can drain into pond Keep household, domestic ,lawn and garden debris including grass clippings, leaf litter, animal wastes, compost piles, etc., from entering water Restrict larger populations of waterfowl from inhabiting pond or waterway Use approved chemical or physical deterrents to keep geese and other waterfowl from becoming a waste nuisance and nutrient source Check with local or state agencies for options Native aquatic plants can add tremendous nutrient buffering capacity to a pond Caution Some natives can dominate shorelines to nuisance levels Some states require permits to plant natives Plantings should exceed natural predation pressure Properly stocked fish can benefit a pond Adds component to the food web complexity Assimilate nutrients into biomass Caution Rough fish can disturb the sediment-water interface
