the lining of the stomach pylorus - narrow passage which connects the stomach with the small intestine Pyloric sphincter - muscle that controls the flow between the stomach and the Duodenum Columnar epithelium has gastic pits which lead to gastric glands, produce gastric juice Gastric juice contains pepsin - digests protein Also HCI and mucous HCI - gives the stomach its acidity - pH =2 which helps kill most bacteria Present in food, it does not digest food but does break down Connective tissue found in meat and activates pepsin Mucous secreted by the goblet cells protects the stomach lining from the acidity If the HCI penetrates the mucous, the wall can begin to break down - it is now believed That Helicobacter pylon (bacteria) impairs the ability of epithelial cells to Produce

intestine is slightly basic to neutralize the chyme enzymes from the pancreas help complete the digestion process The surface area of the wall of the small intestine is approximately that of a tennis

release is stimulated by the HCI in the chyme And CCK - cholecystokinin - whose release is stimulated by partially Digested protein and fats Once \nthese hormones enter the bloodstream - the liver
