Respiratory System Again because terrestrial animals expend more energy than aquatic animals an improved respiratory system is required Oxygen required for ATP production during cell respiration C02 generated as a biproduct of cell respiration Tadpoles breathe through gills Adult frogs breathe through Lungs-pulmonary respiration-air is inhaled and exhaled by changing the volume and pressure of air in the mouth Skin-cutaneous respiration-the exchange of gases through skin Important during estivation and hibernation Mouth-accounts for a small amount of respiration Glottis- passage between throat and lungs Excretory System Two types of metabolic waste products Carbon dioxide from cell respiration Waste compounds from metabolic breakdown of foods Kidneys are the primary excretory organs Filter nitrogenous wastes from the blood -&gt; urine Kidneys -&gt; urinary ducts -&gt; urinary bladder -&gt; cloaca Urine and digestive wastes are eliminated through the anus Frogs eliminate excess water by excreting a large volume of very dilute urine Nervous System More varied environment than fish -&gt; more complex brain Diagram - Frog- nervous system Olfactory lobes are the center for olfaction (smell) Optic lobes control vision Cerebrum controls voluntary activity Cerebellum is center of the balance and coordination Medulla oblongata controls organ functions 10 pairs of cranial nerves (direct connection with brain) Spinal cord and spinal nerves transmit signals from all parts of the body to the brain and back to the brain Reproductive System Complex life cycle Two life stages (tadpole and adult) Diagram - Frog- reproductive and excretory systems Male frog Two bean-shaped creamy white or yellowish testes located near the kidneys Sperm cells develop in the testes and pass through tubes to the kidneys and urinary ducts Leave body through cloacal opening Female frog A pair of large, lobed ovaries containing thousands of tiny immature eggs lie near the kidneys Eggs enlarge, mature, and burst through body walls of ovary into body cavity Cilia move eggs into funnel-like openings of the oviducts Eggs remain in ovisacs until ovulation Leave through the cloacal opening Fertilization Species specific mating call Air vibrates the vocal cord which produces croak Males have vocal sacs Males climb onto back of female and embraces her Amplexus-the mating embrace of frogs When female releases eggs, male discharges his sperm over them-direct external fertilization Within 12 days the eggs hatch into tadpoles Metamorphosis Tadpoles develop three pairs of gills
