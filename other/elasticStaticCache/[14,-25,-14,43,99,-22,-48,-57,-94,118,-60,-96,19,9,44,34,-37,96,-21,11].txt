extremely luminous O stars to very faint M dwarfs Range of about a billion in luminosity Because of their number and common internal structure, main-sequence stars considered to constitute a single class of stars Number of stars in each spectral class important Number of M-type stars far exceeds number of K-type stars Number of K-type stars in turn exceeds number of G-type stars And so on up

mass Mathematical form: L a M 4 Other Properties of Main-Sequence Stars Radii of stars on main sequence increases from small radii M dwarfs to large radii O stars Luminosity, temperature, radius, and mass for main sequence stars increases from M to O stars Fundamental property upon which other three depend is mass of gas composing main-sequence stars Red Giants Red giants - second most prominent region in H-R diagram composed bright, cool stars Red giants are luminous stars in spectral classes F, G, K, and M lying above main sequence in region that angles up toward bright, cool stars in upper

supergiants - if late-type stars in classes G, K, and M Blue and red supergiants can be hundreds of thousands of times more luminous than Sun Blue and red supergiant stars also do not possess definite relation between mass and position in the H-R diagram Radii do increase toward upper right-hand corner Although supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and red supergiants White Dwarfs White dwarfs - span spectral classes \nB, A, and F, and composed of faint stars lying below main sequence Note: when star referred to as being \"on\" or \"off main sequence,\" reference is to position in H-R diagram and not to its actual position in space
