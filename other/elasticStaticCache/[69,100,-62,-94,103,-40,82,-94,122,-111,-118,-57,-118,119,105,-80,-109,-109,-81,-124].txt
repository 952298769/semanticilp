Famous example: Monarch Butterfly ( wiki ). Birds are able to use the magnetic field of the earth ( wiki ). Birds migrating at night use the behaviour of stars to navigate (indigo bunting). How do the first organisms know the geography of the earth or the stars? How do they navigate? How do they know where and when to go? All this knowledge is in their genomes by accident? Extremely unlikely! The theory of independent birth does not predict that organisms should migrate anyway. It predicts organisms adapted to local conditions. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. What if you don't have parents? (first organisms). Some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's Thrush, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago ( wiki ). If a species originated by independent birth, it has no history by definition.",1.8783818483352661],["Behavioral Adaptation: Actions animals take to survive in their environments.
