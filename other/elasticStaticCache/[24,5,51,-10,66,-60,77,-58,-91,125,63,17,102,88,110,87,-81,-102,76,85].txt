suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.6239985823631287],["Username: Password: Post as &quot;Anonymous&quot;

bundles, covers on jars, or even doorways, so that they can't be tampered with which is useful if you are storing valuable goods that someone or some institution owns or controls access to so, like the central storage buildings, these stamp seals suggest private property, exchange, or communal storage both the shared storage and the stamp seals suggest an increasingly complex economy Halaf style pottery became very widespread (5500 BC - 4700 BC) the first really widespread cultural &quot;horizon&quot; Not just isolated fancy pieces, but 80-90% of the pottery assemblage at any site is virtually identical to that from any other site Ceramic paste studies (neutron activation) show decorated pots from a single clay source are found as much as 600 miles (about 1000 kilometers) apart that is, some pots moved at least 300 miles... indicates long-distance trade in ceramics implies some sort of increased communication probably mostly between elites in the larger towns lots of interaction across the region is also implied because house styles and other artifacts also very uniform Samarra culture (5500 BC- 4800 BC): first significant irrigation Farming gradually spread south towards the \"neck\" of Mesopotamia this may have been some combination of people actually moving into the area and a possible low density population of foragers who were already there and began to adopt agriculture subsistence was the same basic neolithic mix, but requiring irrigation Evidence of irrigation: the region in general is too dry for reliable farming without it they cultivated at least one crop that would not have produced at all in this region without irrigation: flax (linseed) for fiber used in linen cloth sites are found in the areas where natural flooding could be most easily channeled and drained sites are lined up along contour lines, implying that they lay along shared canals as we saw before, irrigation suggests intensification more investment in the land more permanent settlement maybe land ownership greater vulnerability to attack and need for defense maybe greater needs to coordinate work, set up conflict resolution institutions, etc. but this can all still happen in pretty small-scale societies, without necessarily having strong leadership or very complex social organization largest sites were only around 6 ha (site of Samarra) about three times the size of the main quad estimated about 1000 people many villages would have had a few hundred people the Samarra economy apparently had some complex features stamp seals possible maker's marks on pottery suggest craft specialization and exchange limited amounts of copper suggest long-distance exchange but houses were relatively uniform in size and elaboration suggesting little variation in social status Some Samarra sites had large, presumably shared buildings Tell es-Sawwan: large buildings (up to 17 rooms) that are interpreted as temples Some Samarra sites were fortified Tell

from Jeffrey L. Star, University of California at Santa Barbara, and Holly Dickinson, SUNY Buffalo A. INTRODUCTION need to have tools to transform spatial data of various types into digital format data input is a major bottleneck in application of GIS technology costs of input often consume 80% or more of project costs data input is labor intensive, tedious, error-prone there is a danger that construction of the database may become an end in itself and the project may not move on to analysis of the data collected essential to find ways to reduce costs, maximize accuracy need to automate the input process as much as possible, but: automated input often creates bigger editing problems later source documents (maps) may often have to be redrafted to meet rigid quality requirements of automated input because of the costs involved, much research has gone into devising better input methods - however, few reductions in cost have been realized sharing of digital data is one way around the input bottleneck more and more spatial data is becoming available in digital form data input to a GIS involves encoding both the locational and attribute data the locational data is encoded as coordinates on a particular cartesian coordinate system source maps may have different projections, scales several stages of data transformation may be needed to bring all data to a common coordinate system attribute data is often obtained and stored in tables Modes of data input keyboard entry for non-spatial attributes and occasionally locational data manual locating devices user directly manipulates a device whose location is recognized by the computer e.g. digitizing automated devices automatically extract spatial data from maps and photography e.g. scanning conversion directly from other digital sources voice input has been tried, particularly for controlling digitizer operations not very successful - machine needs to be recalibrated for each operator, after coffee breaks, etc. B. DIGITIZERS digitizers are the most common device for extracting spatial information from maps and photographs the map, photo, or other document is placed on the flat surface of the digitizing tablet Hardware the position of an indicator as it is moved over the surface of the digitizing tablet is detected by the computer and interpreted as pairs of x,y coordinates the indicator may be a pen-like stylus or a cursor (a small flat plate the size of a hockey puck with a cross-hair) frequently, there are control buttons on the cursor which permit control of the system without having to turn attention from the digitizing tablet to a computer terminal digitizing tablets can be purchased in sizes from 25x25 cm to 200x150 cm, at approximate costs from $500 to $5,000 early digitizers (ca. 1965) were backlit glass tables a magnetic field generated by the cursor was tracked mechanically by an arm located behind the table the arm's motion was encoded, coordinates computed and sent to a host processor some early low-cost systems had mechanically linked cursors - the free-cursor digitizer was initially much more expensive the first solid-state systems used a spark generated by the cursor and detected by linear microphones problems with errors generated by ambient noise contemporary tablets use a grid of wires embedded in the tablet to generate a magnetic field which is detected by the cursor accuracies are typically better than 0.1 mm this is better than the accuracy with which the average operator can position the cursor functions for transforming coordinates are sometimes built into the tablet and used to process data before it is sent to the host The digitizing operation the map is affixed to a digitizing table three or more control points (\"reference points\", \"tics\", etc.) are digitized for each map sheet these will be easily identified points (intersections of major streets, major peaks, points on coastline) the coordinates of these points will \nbe known in the coordinate system to be used in the final database, e.g. lat/long, State Plane Coordinates, military grid the control points are used by the system to calculate the necessary mathematical transformations to convert all coordinates to the final system the more control points, the better digitizing the map contents can be done in two different modes: in point mode, the operator identifies the points to be captured explicitly by pressing a button in stream mode points are captured at set time intervals (typically 10 per second) or on movement of the cursor by a fixed amount advantages and disadvantages: in point mode the operator selects points subjectively two point mode operators will not code a line in the same way stream mode generates large numbers of points, many of which may be redundant stream mode is more demanding on the user while point mode requires some judgement about how to represent the line most digitizing is currently done in point mode Problems with digitizing maps arise since most maps were not drafted for the purpose of digitizing paper maps are unstable: each time the map is removed from the digitizing table, the reference points must be re-entered when the map is affixed to the table again if the map has stretched or shrunk in the interim, the newly digitized points will be slightly off in their location when compared to previously digitized points errors occur on these maps, and these errors are entered into the GIS database as well the level of error in the GIS database is directly related to the error level of the source maps maps are meant to display information, and do not always accurately record locational information for example, when a railroad, stream and road all go through a narrow mountain pass, the pass may actually be depicted wider than its actual size to allow for the three symbols to be drafted in the pass discrepancies across map sheet boundaries can cause discrepancies in the total GIS database e.g. roads or streams that do not meet exactly when two map sheets are placed next to each other user error causes overshoots, undershoots (gaps) and spikes at intersection of lines diagram user fatigue and boredom for a complete discussion on the manual digitizing process, see Marble et al, 1984 Editing errors from digitizing some errors can be corrected automatically small gaps at line junctions overshoots and sudden spikes in lines error rates depend on the complexity of the map, are high for small scale, complex maps these topics are explored in greater detail in later Units Unit 13 looks at the process of editing digitized data Units 45 and 46 discuss digitizing error Digitizing costs a common rule of thumb in the industry is one digitized boundary per minute e.g. it would take 99/60 = 1.65 hours to digitize the boundaries of the 99 counties of Iowa C. SCANNERS Video scanner essentially television cameras, with appropriate interface electronics to create a computer-readable dataset available in either black and white or color extremely fast (scan times of under 1 second) relatively inexpensive ($500 - $10,000) produce a raster array of brightness (or color) values, which are then processed much like any other raster array typical data arrays from video scanners are of the order of 250 to 1000 pixels on a side typically have poor geometrical and radiometrical characteristics, including various kinds of spatial distortions and uneven sensitivity to brightness across the scanned field video scanners are difficult to use for map input because of problems with distortion and interpretation of features Electromechanical scanner unlike the video scanning systems, electromechanical systems are typically more expensive ($10,000 to 100,000) and slower, but can create better quality products one common class of scanners involves attaching the graphic to a drum as the drum rotates about its axis, a scanner head containing a light source and photodetector reads the reflectivity of the target graphic, and digitizing this signal, creates a single column of pixels from the graphic the scanner head moves along the axis of the drum to create the next column of pixels, and so on through the entire scan compare the action of a lathe in a machine shop this controls distortion by bringing the single light source and detector to position on a regular grid of locations on the graphic systems may have a scan spot size of as little as 25 micrometers, and be able to scan graphics of the order of 1 meter on a side an alternative mechanism involves an array of photodetectors which extract data from several rows of the raster simultaneously the detector moves across the document in a swath when all the columns have been scanned, the detector moves to a new swath of rows for an in-depth discussion scanning techniques, see Peuquet and Boyle (1984) Requirements for scanning documents must be clean (no smudges or extra markings) lines should be at least 0.1 mm wide complex line work provides greater chance of error in scanning text may be accidently scanned as line features contour lines cannot be broken with text automatic feature recognition is not easy (two contour lines vs. road symbols) diagram special symbols (e.g. marsh symbols) must be recognized and dealt with if good source documents are available, scanning can be an efficient time saving mode of data input D. CONVERSION FROM OTHER DIGITAL SOURCES involves transferring data from one system to another by means of a conversion program more and more data is becoming available in magnetic media USGS digital cartographic data (DLGs - Digital Line Graphs) digital elevation models (DEMs) TIGER and other census related data data from CAD/CAM systems (AutoCAD, DXF) data from other GIS these data generally are supplied on digital tapes that must be read into the computer however, CD-ROM is becoming increasingly popular for this purpose provides better standards CD-ROM hardware is much less expensive - CD-ROM drive $ \n1000, tape drive $14,000 Automated Surveying directly determines the actual horizontal and vertical positions of objects two kinds of measurements are made: distance and direction traditionally, distance measuring involved pacing, chains and tapes of various materials direction measurements were made with transits and theodolites modern surveyors have a number of automated tools to make distance and direction measurements easier electronic systems measure distance using the time of travel of beams of light or radio waves by measuring the round-trip time of travel, from the observing instrument to the object in question and back, we can use the relationship (d = v x t) to determine the distance an instrument based on timing the travel of a pulse of infrared light can measure distances on the order of 10 km with a standard deviation of +/- 15 mm the total station (cost about $30,000) captures distance and direction data in digital form the data is downloaded to a host computer at the end of each session for direct input to GIS and other programs Global Positioning System (GPS) a new tool for determining accurate positions on the surface of the earth computes positions from signals received from a series of satellites (NAVSTAR) as of April, 1990 there are 20 in orbit, by 1991 there should be the full set of 24 are currently 7 active but eventually will be 21 depends on precise information about the orbits of the satellites a radio receiver with appropriate electronics is connected to a small antenna, and depending on the method used, in one hour to less than 1 second, the system is able to determine its location in 3-",0.4381374716758728],["X1014305702-00173-36372</DOCNO> Idiom Definition Index C Wayne Magnuson: English Idioms Idiom Definition

will not pass ground water Confined aquifers--pressurized aquifers capped by impermeable rock Artesian wells--flowing wells supplied by pressure from confined aquifers Problems with Groundwater--water supply, contamination, salt-water incursion Caverns--dissolved limestone cavities that transport groundwater streams Sinkholes--surface depressions caused by the collapse of underground caverns Stalactites/stalagmites/columns--Dripstone formations that form in caves Chapter 12: The Work of Glaciers and Wind Glaciers--thick masses of ice that flow under their own weight Valley glaciers--long, linear glaciers that flow down mountain valleys Continental glaciers--large flat glaciers that flow outward from a center Parts of Glaciers Zone of accumulation--snow accumulates &amp; recrystallizes into glacial ice Equilibrium line--point of maximum flow, usually corresponds to snow line Zone of ablation--glacier melts and releases its sediment load Features left by Glaciation Erosional: cirques, horns, ar tes, U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, tarns, paternoster lakes, striations, fjords Depositional: till, moraines (lateral, medial, terminal, recessional, ground), drumlins, kames, eskers, kettle lakes, outwash plains, erratics, varves Icebergs--floating freshwater ice blocks calved from glaciers reaching the ocean Ice-marginal lakes--large lakes formed from ice dams or ice-weight depressions Pluvial lakes--large lakes that formed in glacial times but not close to glaciers Land bridges--continental connections that arise from a lowering of sea level Deserts and Eolian (Wind) processes Deserts--regions of dry climate due to falling air Exotic streams--rivers that arise in humid regions then flow across deserts Ephemeral streams--streams that only flow occasionally during flash floods Playa lakes--salty intermittent lakes that fill only during wet years or seasons Desertification--conversion of marginal land to desert by human activities Wind erosion--abrasion, deflation, blowouts, ventifacts, desert pavement Wind deposition--barchan dunes, transverse dunes, linear dunes, star dunes, parabolic dunes, loess Chapter 13: Waves and Coastal Currents Wave Characteristics Wave particle motion--circles in deep water, ellipses in shallow water Wave speed--longer waves travel faster, all waves slow down in shallow water Wave base--depth at which waves stop oscillating the water (half wavelength) Wave diffraction--waves spread out after passing through a narrow opening Wave refraction--waves bend when reaching shallow water at an angle Evolution of Ocean Waves Storms--generation of waves (wind energy converted to wave energy) Swell--free traveling waves (can travel thousands of miles without dissipation) Surf--the breaking of waves along a coast (geologic work by wave energy) Wave Action along Coasts Waves cut a platform and a cliff at sea level Waves transport beach sediment by longshore drift Waves refract to attack headlands and fill bays (making a straight coastline) Barrier islands form, shielding lagoons, in areas with large sediment volume Tsunamis (Seismic Sea Waves) Long and dangerous waves created by earthquakes or underwater landslides Can devastate coastal communities if they are not properly warned Ocean Tides (Gravity-induced waves) Bulges of water form toward and away from the earth &amp; move like giant waves The Moon/Sun interaction produces Spring Tides and Neap Tides The earth's tilt (declination) moves the bulges north and south of the equator Tidal bulges can't keep up with the earth's rotation (1000 MPH) because of their slow speed (450 MPH) and blocking by continents Ocean basins with a natural 12 or 24 hour resonance have high tidal ranges Large ocean basins have rotary tides (circle around a point) Chapter 14: Ocean Waters Ocean Water Origin and Composition Water--H 2 0, polar molecule causes surface tension and high heat capacity Water derived from volcanic volatiles and cometary collisions with Earth Ocean water well mixed, interacts with atmosphere, seafloor, and land Color blue or green because these wavelengths penetrate the deepest Dissolved gasses--more oxygen near surface, more carbon dioxide at depth Nutrients--depleted at surface (removed by organisms which then die &amp; sink) Salinity--typically about 35 , mostly chlorine (19.4 ) and sodium (10.8 ) Density--increases with decreasing temperature &amp; increasing salinity Thermocline--temperature profile caused by solar radiation and water density Thermocline creates the SOFAR channel which confines sound waves Surface (horizontal) Circulation (relatively fast) Driven by surface winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) Controlled by Coriolis Effect and continental barriers Gyres circulate clockwise in northern hemisphere, CCW in S. hemisphere Gulf Stream and similar currents are \"rivers in the ocean\" Eddies north of Gulf Stream Eddies south of Gulf Stream Spin clockwise Spin counterclockwise Warm water cores Cold water cores Stay at surface Sink deep Low in nutrients &amp; life High in nutrients &amp; life Deep (vertical) Circulation (very slow) Driven by differences in water density (due to temperature and salinity) Vertical circulation is often blocked by the thermocline Deep upwelling near poles, shallow upwelling along coasts and at equator Upwelled waters contain nutrients and have high biological productivity Mediterranean Sea water circulates horizontally due to its high salinity Chapter 15: Marine and Nearshore Environments Oceanic Zones Epicontinental Seas--shallow continental arms of the sea (i.e. Hudson Bay) Continental Shelves--shallow flooded edges of continents (i.e. North Sea) Shelf Break--edge of continent where shelf drops off toward deep ocean floor Continental Slope--steep incline, cut by numerous submarine canyons Continental Rise--area of deep-sea fans and turbidite \ndeposits from Slope Abyssal Plains--deep flat areas of the ocean floor covered with clays and oozes Trenches--deepest zones of the ocean, correspond to tectonic subduction zones Transgressions--rises in sea level that flood more of the continents Regressions--drops in sea level that expose formerly covered continental areas Coastal Zones of the United States (from north to south) Glacial Erosion--many fjords and islands with hard bedrock (coast of Maine) Glacial Deposition--peninsulas and islands made of glacial till (Cape Cod) Estuaries--drowned river valleys cut by glacial runoff (Chesapeake bay) Barrier islands &amp; lagoons--stable coasts south of glacially-effected areas Mangrove swamps--lagoons warm enough to support mangrove trees Features of Barrier Island/Lagoon Sequences Brackish water--sea water diluted by river runoff, lower than normal salinity Tidal channels--cuts through barrier islands with flood and ebb tide deltas Salt marshes--quiet coastal marshes with high biologic productivity Coral Reefs : complex shallow water communities supported by a framework Require warm water, strong sunlight, a hard substrate, no sediment input 1) Fringing reefs--initial reefs attached directly to volcanic oceanic island 2) Barrier reefs--reefs separated from an island by a lagoon due to subsidence 3) Atolls--isolated rings of reef from which a former island has submerged Chapter 16: Earth Resources Renewable Resources--part of geologic cycles, in ever-existing supply Non-renewable Resources--available in limited quantities, non-regenerating Water (Renewable) Renewable resource but in a limited supply in desert areas Resource can be destroyed by pollution and salt water incursion Desalination or other processing sometimes necessary to make water useful Raw Materials (Non-renewable) Geologic Concentration Processes: Hydrothermal precipitation--Copper, gold, lead, galena, sphalerite Igneous cooling--feldspar, quartz, lithium, diamonds (from pegmatites) Metamorphism--garnet, talc Evaporation--salt, gypsum, borax Soil leaching--aluminum (from bauxite) Placer sorting--gold, silver, platinum, diamonds Precambrian anoxic environments--iron (from Banded Iron Formations) Metallic

Martin Wignall by Mark R. Wilkins Martin Wignall, normally a man of great inner strength, known among his neighborhood and his town as one of those people whose mere presence brings peace to those struggling with conflict and whose insights were universally regarded as a blessing to those given the gift of hearing them, known as a man always well-dressed and forever in perfect form, nails manicured, hair just so, conservative wire-rimmed eyeglasses always exactly in place and never prone to slip down his nose, known as the father of eight perfect little girls all ten years old and themselves always precisely poised, known as a man whose only ignominious moment had been at the age of twenty-three when, seized by a terrible impure fit of jealousy completely unlike him, he had struck with a tremendous 1948 Ford pickup truck and repeatedly backed over again and again his best friend Phil Kardass who in a moment of passion had defiled the fidelity of Martin's one true love, a strange, quiet young lady named June, June for whom the flowers would sing and whose tears over the premature death of Phil would stain the hitherto perfect pattern of Martin's soul for all eternity, Martin, known as a man who managed to fight off with remarkable persistence the unfortunately periodic urge to fondle his daughters, only slipping his hands where they didn't belong on the unusual day when his inner strength was not exactly so great as perhaps it should have been had his steeled resistance to temptation been godlike rather than merely human, though occasionally, just between you and me, those few unusual days on which he would touch his daughters would sometimes feature in Martin's behavior the extremes of human perversity to an extent that the general knowledge of his behavior would perhaps not have been quite so flattering had the story gotten out among his peers, a group of people whose tolerance of fathers fondling their little girls was, shall we say, low, lower in fact than in many small towns which already share a much higher ethical and moral standard than, say, Los Angeles, in which I dare say you could find a neighborhood in which it probably is considered, heaven forbid, almost normal to cop a feel with one's daughter once in a while, not that I'm suggesting that you move there or anything should you be inclined to such things, and certainly not that I'm suggesting that such neighborhoods should not be burned to the ground as decent men would were they marked clearly in flaming red letters on the street maps, was much surprised to find himself called upon by society as he had been, as a man of such character would have to be, especially growing up in such a town as he did in which children, except his own young girls, of course, who did not experience the benefit of their parents assiduously protecting their innocence by declining to fondle \nthem every single time the temptation arose rather than only the vast majority of the time, were sheltered from the knowledge of the big, wide adult world out there, the world which many adults would love to forget and be children again if only they did not know that they would be assaulted by that adult world in their nightmares even if spared the day-to-day exposure to horror and perversity which marks adulthood, fearing even the walk to the parking lot, as sadly many adults of today do, fearing the occasional black man who walks down the street, although God knows there are a few black men who are alright and it is the responsibility of every Christian to give the odd black man the benefit of the doubt, even if it is most likely that the black man is unemployed, living on the handouts provided by those damned bleeding- heart liberals whose high-minded ideals are bleeding our own hearts dry, or worse, that the black man is a murderer who has yet to be caught, or perhaps a murderer at heart who has yet to murder, and perhaps should be dispatched immediately to spare his victim the pain of acting out the performance which will make the black man fulfill his destiny, even though the liberal courts could not support such a thing, even if Martin Wignall, in the midst of fondling his daughters, would, yes, Martin was surprised enough that it took him uncomfortable minutes to find his bags, minutes which would have been much more difficult to spare, had he known of the surveillance, the call on the radio of the police car, the plump, balding man setting aside his jelly doughnut carefully so as not to stain his bright blue uniform shirt, his shiny badge which he loved so much, his stylish yet classic hat which sat on the seat beside him, or his beautiful, yet more classic, Beretta 9mm pistol which would come unusually handy in a very short while, to the plump man's great surprise, or had Martin even known of the call his wife had made a week before, crying in the dark, hoping that her husband would not awaken to find her out of bed, but since he knew none of these things Martin remained willing to look for the bags despite his surprise at the Lieutenant's phone call, and though the car pulled up as he started to throw his clothing, half of it dirty, into the bags, since the plump man did not run the siren Martin did not see the car and continued at a measured, methodical pace, to pack, the kind of pace at which you see paramedics work to rescue a victim, a kind of controlled rush which allows them to calmly take all the necessary steps without going so fast that they will skip the essential, for the manner in which society had expressed its needs to Martin was in the form of the Lieutenant's phone call, which stated that he was to give himself up peacefully and that a car would be dispatched to fetch him some thirty minutes hence, when in fact the car was dispatched much sooner with instructions to wait outside Martin's door to prevent his attempt to flee, as is sometimes done when kind police lieutenants wish to spare their apprehendee the embarrassment of having to prepare their personal effects with an officer watching, but usually only of course when the police lieutenant does not know about such ignominious moments as Martin's backing over Phil again and again and again to drive the image in his head of Phil and June pursuing their own ignominious moment of human joy away, as the police lieutenant presiding in Martin's town on the day of his attempted apprehension did not, \"attempted,\" I say, because as Martin heard the crack of a twig outside and peered out the window he realized the trap which had been set for him and searched for his own beloved 9mm Beretta, a tool which for moments of desperation many of those who fondle their eight daughters all the same age might very well be advised to hide away, as did Martin, posessed of the gift of foresight, but when he found the pistol he discovered it to be bereft of cartridges, a sad comment on the state of Martin's preparation considering how truly inexpensive a box of the things can be if you look in the right place, so Martin was left with no other option than to attempt to sneak out the back, an attempt in which Martin was thwarted by the simple and depressing fact that he had welded the back door shut to keep unwanted visitors away, especially during private trysts with his daughters, and having had his one option taken from him he searched his head for the option which really was no option at all, to seize his wife and hold the pistol to her head as he walked down the front steps, comically trying to carry his bags over his shoulders, a course of action which left his emotionally destroyed wife in a foggy state of psychological disrepair, as the frozen image of the bag over Martin's shoulder swinging beneath her eyes recalled to her the romantic trip, taken in younger, more carefree days, the trip on which she and Martin had fallen in love all over again for the first time since her true love Phil had been run over again and again and again by Martin's 1948 Ford pickup, and on which six of the eight daughters had been conceived, the other two daughters having been the product of two minor infidelities which were such small trifles as not to have formed a real mark on Martin's record, for even good Christians enjoy a little trifle with someone on the side, if you know what I mean, and \neven so June had forgiven Martin because on the trip she'd fallen so much in love again, and besides, it's hard to run out on the man whose virile tendencies have just been the cause of sextuplets growing within you, especially when you yourself have no real means by which to support yourself, let alone six children, but the warm memory of the trip floating through June's mind was not enough to blot out the harsh sound of a gunshot which echoed through the air or the warm feeling of blood on her shoulder from the awful gaping wound in Martin's head, for as all good Christians know an unloaded Beretta with no clip has a big hole in the handle and it can be very hard, in the haste of a difficult emotional situation, to remember to protect such a detail from an attentive police officer such as the plump man was, especially if the sugar with which the jelly doughnut was laced had heightened the officer's otherwise adrenaline-pumped senses of awareness to the point at which he would see that there were no danger to killing Martin even if there were in fact such danger, but fortunately there was not, and before Martin had even dropped to the ground unconscious the officer had shaken off his panic with the ease of the righteous killer and had reached for the jelly doughnut, which yielded up to him with just the right amount of resistance another chewy, sweet, succulent bite, ripe with the flavor of cherry, a flavor so perfect as to even overwhelm the plump man's flush of success.",0.40661174058914185]]
