Explanations for Transpiration: Grew - thought that xylem (vessels &amp; tracheids) pumped the water along through the plant Malpighi - suggested that capillary action moved the water up through the plant Hales - discovered root pressure, which is noticeable when plants are pruned and water exits through the cut ends, this is due to root pressure by osmosis and other forces identified a pulling force due to evaporation of water through leaves and stems Today's Explanation: Cohesion-Tension Theory - H2O molecules are polar and due to these negatively and positively charged ends, H2O molecules are able to hydrogen bond (or cohere) to one another and adhere to capillary walls permitting an amount of tension as water transpires, a &quot;pull&quot; or tension is formed on water columns, drawing from one water molecule to another throughout the xylem cells Translocation - movement of food substances in solution (water) by the phloem Pressure flow hypothesis - the theory that food substances in solution in plants flow along concentration gradients between the sources of the food and sinks (places where food is utilized) Phloem loading - the process of sugar entering the phloem

clump together due to activities of soil organisms, freezing and thawing too much water leaches nutrients (mostly in course soils) Water in the Soil Hygroscopic Water - Gravitational Water - if the
