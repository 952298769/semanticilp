There are a number of techniques used to try and control this process.… The introduction of plants is used quite often for bringing soil erosion under control. The roots that they form in the soil act to bind or hold the soil together preventing it from being washed or blown away. Also vegetation cover acts to decrease the rate which rainfall reaches the ground surface helping to reduce run off and in turn reduce the rate of soil erosion by this moving water. Another method to prevent soil erosion is the use of geosynthetic mats. These are man made sheets or mats composed of various materials that are pegged into place on the surface in localised areas that are prone to erosion (for example footpaths in national parks that receive significant numbers of hikers). The lateral movement of sand along a beach (and ultimately along an entire coast line) due to prevailing currents / wind directions can cause significant losses of material. This process is natural and is known as longshore drift. In some areas, to prevent or reduce the impact of longshore drift, groynes (vertical walls of rock fill or even timber) are constructed perpendicular to the long axis of the beach which help prevent longshore drift from removing the sand. Another coastal protection measure that helps to reduce eriosion and weathering is the use of rock fill (large boulder sized pieces of rock greater than 25.6 cm in diameter) that are placed at the base of cliffs composed of soft materials. These act as breakwaters and dissipate wave energy before it reaches the cliff so preventing or significantly reducing the potential for weathering and erosion.

Broadly, sedimentary rock is classified as being clastic, organic, or chemical. Following are the three types and how they are formed. <br /><br /><b>Clastic</b> sedimentary rock: <br /> The majority of sedimentary rock on Earth is formed from particles of pre-existing rocks. This route begins with the weathering and erosion of sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rocks. Through these processes, larger rock is broken up into smaller particles which are transported by moving water, ice, gravity or wind, and deposited at the bottom of a lake, a river delta, an ocean, or similar location where further movement is restricted or slowed down. The rock particles can range in size from boulders to clay particles less than .002 mm in diameter. If these rock particles are covered by additional particles, eventually the weight from above will start the process of lithification. Lithification is the compaction and cementing together of sediment particles which form rock. Compaction squeezes out the fluids and space that exist between the particles, and cementation results when minerals form from the migrating solution. Once cementation occurs, the new sedimentary rock has been formed. Rocks formed in this manner include sandstone, shale, mudstone, breccia, and conglomerate. <br /><br /><b>Organic</b> sedimentary rock: <br /> Chalk and other fossiliferous limestones are composed of the skeletons of marine organisms. Coal is composed of vegetation that originated and was deposited in swampy and marshy waterlogged soils which prevented their full decay after their death. As their remains piled up and were covered by more and more deposits, they were compacted and cemented in the same manner as clastic rock. <br /><br /><b>Chemical</b> sedimentary rock: <br /> Sedimentary rock can also form when minerals in a body of water have so saturated the water that they precipitate out, like a cloud that is so full of moisture that it pours out rain. Some limestones are formed in this manner as the mineral calcite precipitates out of a saturated solution and undergoes the process of compaction and cementation. The supersaturated solutions can also be caused by evaporation of a body of water high in mineral solution content. As the water evaporates, the mineral percentage of the remaining solution becomes higher and higher, until the mineral crystallizes. Rocks such as rock salt and rock gypsum are formed in this manner. <br /><b><br /></b><br>It is formed by the sedimentation of material at the Earth's surface and also in the bodies of water.",1.3723558187484741],["Proficiency Standards By the End of Grade Two Students will be able to: Keep daily records of temperature (hot, warm, cool, cold) and precipitation (some, none, lots) through a period of time and organize the information in a chart or graph Identify the important attributes of different landscapes (e.g., beaches, mountains, deserts) Describe a variety of natural and man-made changes in the earth's surface that they have observed (water level in streams and rivers, tidal changes, wind blown sand or soil, work of earth-moving machinery) Sort and categorize rocks, minerals and other earth materials using one or more characteristics By the End of Grade Four Students will be able to: Use maps and globes to explain that most of the earth's surface is covered by water Identify/give examples of geological processes that have shaped New Hampshire's landscape over long periods of time Relate observed weather conditions to different climates and seasons Investigate different stages in the water cycle (melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation) By the End of Grade Six Students will be able to: Analyze rocks to obtain evidence of weathering and erosion Identify common geographic features of New Hampshire landscapes, e.g., mountains, lakes Describe basic facts about major features of the Earth's surface and natural changes in the features, e.g., volcanoes, earthquakes, glaciers Identify/give examples of geological processes that have shaped New Hampshire's landscape over long periods of time, e.g., volcanoes, glaciers, weathering Observe, describe and record weather conditions such as clouds, temperature, air pressure, and precipitation Identify events in nature that have repeating patterns or cycles, e.g., weather patterns, water cycle, rock cycle Identify common rocks and minerals using their physical properties Construct models that demonstrate the effects of water, ice, wind, and waves on the Earth's land surfaces, e.g., stream tables, wave tanks Compare and contrast the various types of common clouds Relate observed weather conditions to different climates and seasonal changes 4c.

The size of eroded materials a stream can carry depends on the speed of the stream, and the turbulence or roughness of the water; a fast turbulent stream can carry large rocks, while a slow gently flowing stream carries only particles of sand and clay.",1.3225020170211792],["Erosion begins with a process called weathering; in this process, environmental factors break rock and soil into smaller pieces, and loosen them from the earth's surface.",1.3199440240859985],["Erosion is defined as the removal of soil , sediment , regolith , and rock fragments from the landscape. Most landscapes show obvious evidence of erosion. Erosion is responsible for the creation of hills and valleys. It removes sediments from areas that were once glaciated, shapes the shorelines of lakes and coastlines, and transports material downslope from elevated sites. In order for erosion to occur three processes must take place: detachment , entrainment and transport . Erosion also requires a medium to move material. Wind, water, and ice are the mediums primarily responsible for erosion. Finally, the process of erosion stops when the transported particles fall out of the transporting medium and settle on a surface. This process is called deposition . Figure 10w-1 illustrates an area of Death Valley, California where the effects of erosion and deposition can be easily seen.",1.3192204236984253],["surface processes such as erosion by streams, wind and glaciers, and the folding and faulting of solid rock;",1.318200707435608],["surface processes such as erosion by streams, wind and glaciers, and the folding and faulting of solid rock;",1.318200707435608],["Erosion in the context of soil and watershed conservation is the detachment and movement of soil particles by natural forces, primarily water and wind. More broadly, erosion is the process of wearing away rocks, geologic, and soil material via water, wind, or ice (e.g., glaciers).

They are under tremendous pressure because of the overlying rock material. When erosion removes the overlying rock material, these intrusive rocks are exposed and the pressure on them is released. The outer parts of the rocks then tend to expand. The expansion sets up stresses which cause fractures parallel to the rock surface to form. Over time, sheets of rock break away from the exposed rocks along the fractures, a process known as exfoliation . Exfoliation due to pressure release is also known as \"sheeting\".",1.314113974571228],["Once the pieces are separated from the rocks, erosion is the process that moves those pieces.",1.3133811950683594],["Rocks at the Earth's surface Rocks open to attack by the weather Examples Any type of rock weathering Attack by weather to loosen, but not remove, solid rock Examples freeze/thaw heating/cooling acid rain attack Weathered rocks/soil Loosened rock material erosion/ transportation Removal of rock material as sediment Examples by water wind ice gravity Mobile sediment Sediments being transported by water, wind, ice or gravity deposition Sediments laid down Examples by slowing water currents slowing wind currents melting ice Sedimentary sequences Layers of sediment compaction/ cementation Compression by layers above/natural cement crystallised between the grains Examples compressed muds cemented sands Sedimentary rocks Rock formed from mineral.",1.3099372386932373],["Erosion wearing away of the earth's surface, by wind, flowing water, or glaciers.",1.309706211090088],["Erosion is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water.",1.309706211090088],["(Erosion is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water.)",1.309706211090088],["Erosion wearing away of the earth's surface, by wind, flowing water, or glaciers.",1.309706211090088]]
