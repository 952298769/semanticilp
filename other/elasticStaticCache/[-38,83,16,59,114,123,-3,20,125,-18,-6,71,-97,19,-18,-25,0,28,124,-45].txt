bulbs, and parts of plants grow plants from seed and identify plant structures ( roots, stems, leaves) and their functions describe methods by which seeds travel investigate and understand the life cycle of plants understand that plants are a natural resource and that they are important to all life Students: investigate and understand that animals have life needs and specific physical characteristics identify the characteristics of animals including whether they are wild or tame or live in water homes or land homes identify the needs of animals including air, food, water, and a suitable place to live identify that animals have physical characteristics such as body coverings (scales, skin, hair, feathers), body shapes, different number of appendages, and body movements observe and record observations of earthworms identify the basic body parts of an earthworm and the stages of the earthworm s life cycle including egg, hatchling, and adult investigate through \nexperimentation, observation, and data records an earthworm s reaction to different types of soil and light create an appropriate habitat for an earthworm using knowledge from investigations Students: investigate and understand that natural resources are limited identify the following as natural resources: plants and animals, water, air, land, minerals, forests, and soils describe how reducing, reusing, and recycling wastes can help save natural resources Physical Science Students: investigate and understand how different materials interact with water observe and describe the
