rocks, soils, liquid water, and the gases of the atmosphere Knows that water can be a liquid or a solid and can be made to change from one form to the other, but the amount of water stays the same Knows that short-term weather conditions (e.g., temperature, rain, snow) can change daily, and weather patterns change over the seasons Level II: Upper Elementary (Grades 3-5) Knows that water can change from one state to another (solid, liquid, gas) through various processes (e.g., freezing, condensation, precipitation, evaporation) Knows the major differences between fresh and ocean waters Knows that clouds and fog are made of tiny droplets of water Knows that air is a substance that surrounds us, takes up space, and moves around us as wind Knows that night and day are caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis Knows that the Sun provides the light and heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the Earth Level III: Middle School/Jr. High (Grades 6-8) Knows that the Earth is the only body in our solar system that appears able to support life Knows that the Earth is comprised of layers including a core, mantle, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere Knows the composition and structure of the Earth's atmosphere (e.g., temperature and pressure in different layers of the atmosphere, circulation of air masses) Knows ways in which clouds affect weather and climate (e.g., precipitation, reflection of light from the Sun, retention of heat energy emitted from the Earth's surface) Knows how the tilt of the Earth's axis and the Earth's revolution around the Sun affect seasons and weather patterns (i.e., heat falls more intensely on one part or another of the Earth's surface during its revolution around the Sun) Knows factors that can impact the Earth's climate (e.g., changes in the composition of the atmosphere;",0.9022426605224609],["The position of sunrise changes over the course of the year because the earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees and that tilt
