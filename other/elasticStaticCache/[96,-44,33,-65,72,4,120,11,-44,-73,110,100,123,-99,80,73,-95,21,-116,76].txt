Expectations 2 Growth & Changes in Animals Identify and describe the major physical characteristics of different types of animals Identify and describe behavioural characteristics that enable animals to survive Compare ways in which animals eat their food, move and use their environment to meet their needs Describe ways in which animals respond and adapt to their environment Identify basic needs of all living things 4 Habitats and Communities Identify various factors that affect plants and animals in a specific habitat Classify organisms according to their role in the food chain Describe structural adaptations of animals that demonstrate a response of the living things to their environment Classify plants and animals that they have observed in local habitats according to similarities and differences Recognize that animals and plants live in specific habitats because they are dependent on those habitats and have adapted to them Describe ways in which humans can affect the natural world Show the effects on plants and animals of the loss of their natural habitat 6 Diversity of Living Things Demonstrate an understanding of the interrelationships among living things Compare the characteristics of different kinds of arthropods Describe microscopic living things using appropriate tools to assist them with their observations Use appropriate vocabulary, including correct science and technology terminology, in describing their investigations and observations Identify inherited characteristics and learned or behavioural characteristics Describe specific characteristics or adaptations that enable each group of vertebrates to live in its particular habitat (e.g., fish in water), and explain the importance of maintaining that habitat for the survival of the species 7 Interactions Within Ecosystems Identify living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) elements in an ecosystem Identify populations of organisms within an ecosystem and the factors that contribute to their survival in that ecosystem Formulate questions about and identify the needs of various living things in an ecosystem and explore possible answers to these questions and ways of meeting these needs
