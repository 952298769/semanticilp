phytoplankton (photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria) are the major primary producers which produce organic matter (through photosynthesis) which is transferred to higher trophic levels with 75% of the organic matter going into the grazer food chain (to herbivores and carnivores) and 25% of the organic matter going into the decomposer food chain microorganisms are the major primary producers microorganisms are also part of the grazer food chain (including heterotrophic algae, protozoans (= microbial loop)) microorganisms such as bacteria dominate decomposer food chain -

essential trace element for all organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) - simple cycle involving oxidation-reduction reactions (similar to the iron cycle) - cycled by microorganisms between the oxidized manganic (Mn 4+ ) form and the reduced manganous (Mn 2+ ) form - soil and aquatic bacteria are major microorganisms responsible for redox cycle with manganese - reaction pathways in microorganisms - have not studied (ix) CALCIUM CYCLE (see p. 446-447 in Atlas and Bartha (1998)) - biologically important di-valent cation - required for numerous enzymes and for stabilization of cell wall structures - in geochemical cycles - biological precipitation and dissolution of Ca as bicarbonates (HCO 3 ) and carbonates (CO 3 ) - is very important - metabolic activities - which alter pH also affect Ca solubility - carbonate precipitation is involved in the formation of the exoskeleton of various microorganisms (e.g. coccolithophorids, charophytes, foraminiferans), invertebrates (e.g. corals) and vertebrates (e.g. in bone and teeth formation) - Ca deposits are often biogenic e.g. White Cliffs of Dover resulted from deposits of foraminiferan protozoans large Ca deposits associated with coral reefs (x) SILICON CYCLE (see p. 447 in Atlas and Bartha (1998)) - second most abundant element on Earth - occurs as silicon dioxide and silicates - biological role is restricted to structural purposes (e.g. exoskeleton of diatoms, radiolaria and silicoflagellates) - fungi, cyanobacteria and lichens - able to dissolve siliceous rocks (during process of soil formation - see Lecture # 7 for more details) - diatoms - algae with cell walls made of silica (= glass) - silica shells (= frustules) of diatoms are not decomposed and so remain for long periods of time - can identify diatom species from shape and markings on frustules - diatom occurrence used as an environmental indicator of pH, nutrients, climate and can be used to suggest conditions in the environment at the time the diatoms were alive - large deposits of diatom shells = diatomaceous earth - used for a variety of industrial and domestic purposes (e.g. as abrasives in tooth-pastes, and industrial processes) - act to remove silica from the environment when diatom shells settle the lake and ocean sediments -
