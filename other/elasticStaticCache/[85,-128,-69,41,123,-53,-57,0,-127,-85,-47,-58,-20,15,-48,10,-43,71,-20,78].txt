energy is referred to as bioenergetics , a specialized subset of thermodynamics pertaining to living things we'll start our discussion of bioenergetics with some terminology, once you understand what is meant by \nthe different terms the manipulations become quite simple as a caveat, many of the terms that I will be using have common definitions that can lead you astray, so try to think only in terms of the strict thermodynamic definitions when you approach this first of all, we start by restricting our examiniation to a system , this system could be anything from one cell, to a beaker full of something, a rat, all the way up to the entire universe each system has a defined internal energy denoted E this term represents all of the energy, from all forms, contained in the system, including kinetic energy, rotational and vibrational energy, energy stored in chemical bonds (this is obviously a very important one for metabolic discussions) the energy is a function of the state of the system, meaning that it depend on pressure, volume and temperature OK, so lets start to look at something a little more concrete, unless a system is isolated, which no biological ones are, then it can exchange energy with its environment, changing its internal energy this change is called delta E the internal energy of a system is said to change by gain or loss of heat, abbreviated q , and work, w , done by or on the system work is rather broadly defined a couple of comments about heat, a positive value of q denotes heat absorbed by the system, and the opposite is true for work, a positive value of w indicates that work is done by the system on the surroundings, and the opposite applies this all leads us to the first law of thermodynamics, energy is neither created nor destroyed this law is expressed by the equation: delta E = q - w this equation says that the change in energy comes from heat or work a note on the signs here, since a positive q means absorption of energy, or increased energy it is clear why it should be positive here on the other hand, work, when positive, means that the work is done by the system on the surrounding, or energy has been used to do work, so it is negative here 2.",1.7056424617767334],["By studying these, students are helped to discover how all living things depend on each other.",1.697300910949707]]
