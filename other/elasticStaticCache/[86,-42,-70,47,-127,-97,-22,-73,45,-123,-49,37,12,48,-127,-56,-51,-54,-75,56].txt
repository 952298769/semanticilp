They tend to overlook less obvious, but equally important features, for example, the beach. However, deposition is a lot more complex than this and it is important to develop a structure that puts the emphasis on place and scale. The starting point to discussing depositional features is with swash and drift aligned beaches. Remember, a swash aligned beach brings in waves parallel to the shore and as result, they build up beaches. Swash aligned beaches are more influenced by constructive wave patterns, which are also important for building up large beaches. In contrast, drift aligned coasts bring in waves at an angle to the shoreline and so therefore, the waves tend to transport sediment down the coast, keeping beaches relatively narrow. It is drift aligned beaches that are mainly associated with spits, bars and tombolos. Swash beaches are more associated with large beach profiles, with dunes, a variety of berms and beach drainage features.",1.182636022567749],["In addition to being pulled up by the wind, sediments can also move through a process known as saltation, when they actually bounce up the beach out of the reach of the waves. The processes of deposition and saltation can be accelerated by storms and other severe weather, causing a beach to grow or shrink depending on which direction the sediment is moved in. Storms often lead to the deposition of large amounts of sediment, which may slowly erode away in the months following the storm; in other cases, entirely new beaches form in response to dramatic weather.",1.0897644758224487],["The land is subject to erosion and deposition by this process, which occurred repeatedly during the Quaternary;
