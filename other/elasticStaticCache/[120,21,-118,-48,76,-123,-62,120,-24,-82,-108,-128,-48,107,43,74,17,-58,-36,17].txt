[["At low pH, hemoglobin releases O2 more readily CO2 in tissues reacts with water to make carbonic acid (H2CO3) Carbonic acid breaks down to H+ and carbonate ion H+ lowers pH, so fluid is more acidic in tissues Muscles at work release lactic acid, which also lowers pH, makes O2 leave hemoglobin CO2 can also attach to hemoglobin, in different site that O2 In tissues, more CO2 will react with hemoglobin CO2 will displace O2 bound to hemoglobin CO2 travels in blood 10% dissolved in plasma 20% with hemoglobin 70% as bicarbonate ions carbonic anhydrase enzyme in red blood cells catalyzes reaction to make carbonic acid from CO2 and H2O Chloride shift means the negative bicarb ions move out from RBC into plasma, and Cl- ions move from plasma into RBC in tissues In lungs, bicarb transfers back to CO2 and leaves body.",1.0539456605911255],["Remember that in acid the leaving group is not 'OH' but rather H2O (it protonates before it leaves).",1.0013606548309326],["Before and during volcanic eruptions, volatiles such as CO2 and H2O partially leave the melt through a process known as exsolution.",0.9760134220123291]]
