Schist - significant change Foliation of micaceous minerals (muscovite and/or biotite) Other minerals begin to form based on composition of original rock and new conditions Use additional minerals as modifier of name EX: Hornblende schist, quartz schist, etc. Add more HEAT and PRESSURE and it metamorphoses to... Gneiss - high grade metamorphic rock Color banding of light and dark minerals Add more HEAT and PRESSURE and it metamorphoses to...
