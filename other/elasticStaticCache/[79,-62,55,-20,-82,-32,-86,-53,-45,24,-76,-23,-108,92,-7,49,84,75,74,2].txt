in cropping systems.  When broadcast applications of soil-applied herbicides were widely used and followed by one or more cultivations in row crops, pigweeds of any type only occasionally escaped control and developed into a real problem for the grower.  However, with the reduction in usage of soil-applied and incorporated herbicides designated to control grasses and small-seeded weeds, pigweeds escaped control more often.  Sole reliance on postemergence treatments was often not as effective as preemergence or preplant incorporated herbicides for pigweed control.  One reason for this is that pigweeds can emerge from March to September in Tennessee.  Postemergence treatments that lack residual will only control those emerged pigweeds.  Cultivation which had always been a good backup procedure for controlling pigweeds ,has all but ceased and the move toward conservation tillage created a more favorable environment for germination and growth of pigweed species in cropping systems.  Moreover, planting dates for row crops, particularly corn, have been pushed up much earlier in the spring.  Earlier planting dates have helped increase yields but have also extended the amount of time weed control management must be active.  This is primarily due to slower shading by crops under typically cooler growing conditions. ",1.1738555431365967],["Aqueous suspension of
