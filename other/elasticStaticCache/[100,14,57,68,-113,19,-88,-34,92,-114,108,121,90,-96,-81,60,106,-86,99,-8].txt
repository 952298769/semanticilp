Stream must be directed into shaft Shaft must be ventilated Either open shafts, walls, partitions, ceilings, floors, or whatever, or let fire destroy building completely Every effort should be made to minimize damage to building and contents Openings must be large enough for inspection, hose manipulation, ventilation, and to admit sufficient water to extinguish fire Ventilation and search for fire in concealed space companion operations Vertical fire spread Fire travels vertically inside walls and partitions and through pipe shafts, dumbwaiters, air shafts, and similar pathways Many one- and two-family dwellings contain shafts that carry water, gas and electric line or sewer system vent pipes Newer dwellings and apartment houses have central heating vents Vertical channels normally located toward rear of commercial buildings, stores, and shopping centers In apartment buildings, they follow pattern of layouts and most often found near kitchens and bathrooms, each shaft serving several apartments In some modern structures, shafts located in single central core Vent pipes and kitchen vents on roof good indicators of where shafts will be found Vertical concealed spaces often created when interior of building is finished Indications If there is working fire, fire fighters should assume that flames entered concealed space Look for smoke and flames issuing \nfrom walls Blistering, discoloration, or streaking of paint or other wall coverings indicate presence of fire or heat Wall hot to touch Detection of fire by smell Fire may actually crack, hiss, and pop loudly Checking walls Search for vertical spread should begin directly over fire on floor above fire floor Baseboard area should be felt for heat and examined for black streaks on walls If fire extending up within wall, line should be called for before opening wall Wall showing any sign of fire must be opened to allow stream to be directed onto fire Initial opening should be small and waist high Wall opening should not be enlarged unless charged handline available Once line in position, opening should be enlarged until extent of fire determined and knocked down When fire extends above opening, area above must be checked Checking vertical shafts Check all rooms that could contain utility shafts or pipes In apartments, kitchens usually locate one above the other Built-in cabinets below kitchen sink usually constructed with enclosed space between floor and bottom shelf Fire in space will travel to wall and higher stories Fire entering space from below will travel horizontally through space Exhaust ducts develop heavy internal coating of grease which, if ignited, burns with very hot flame that can heat duct If fire involves grease duct, entire length should be checked Ductwork for forced-air systems become matted with lint and dust which can ignite and quickly spread fire Check air intake and outlet registers for smoke and walls around ductwork for heat In some air conditioning systems, space between studs used as return ducts Pipe shafts might be completely concealed within walls or located behind doors and louvers Concealed shafts are hard to find When shafts found, they should be checked for signs of fire travel When intense fire roaring up shaft, floor and ceiling must be checked where they abut shaft If floor warm or ceiling shows signs of fire, area must be opened and stream directed in Checking stairways Fire can start in spaces under stairways Stairways and spaces under them must be checked if near fire Stairs must be kept intact and eliminated as source of fire extension Checking doors and windows Often space between door or window frame and adjacent studs Fire will quickly extend up around the door or window Areas around doors and windows should be carefully checked if in contact with fire or if fire has burned into doors and windows on floor below Horizontal fire spread Although greatest tendency is fire to travel vertically, it also travels horizontally Fire spreads up to ceiling until blocked by ceiling and floor, then burns into ceiling and walls If vertical and horizontal channels, fire will spread through both Fire travels horizontally through spaces between ceilings and floors, over false or hanging ceilings, through cocklofts, through and along ductwork and utility conduits, through conveyor tunnels, and through similar channels Fire can travel through concealed horizontal channels in walls, floors, and ceilings Fire can move horizontally between attached buildings or occupancies through ducts, ceiling spaces,and walls All horizontal channels must be checked for signs of extending fire Indications Few external signs unless fire has reached and involved exterior walls Inside, signs of horizonal fire spread are same as signs of vertical spread Check floors and ceilings for smoke, fire, hot spots, blistering paint, black heat streaks, and sound and smell of fire Checking ceilings When fire has control of an area, ceilings of adjoining units should be opened Most ceilings easily opened with pike pole If fire found, call for line, expose full extent of fire, and knock down If possible, cover furniture and stock High ceilings and thick materials may require going to floor above Ceilings of tile are easy to open Strong draft of fire can lift tiles off rails Where ceiling tiles encountered, check adjoining areas for fire and smoke In older buildings, there may be more than one ceiling with fire not visible above lower ceiling Hanging ceilings may be over sales area but not stock area Light goods and empty cartons may be stored above hanging ceilings Checking attached structures Cocklofts or attics of structures attached to fire structure must be checked for lateral fire spread Where doubt, suspected areas should be checked through ceiling openings Basements of structures attached to fire structure must be checked quickly Party walls support joists for both buildings and often opening in wall where joists overlap Large holes often made for plumbing or electric systems Size-Up (1-1-2) Fire building If no signs of fire, building can be checked quickly to determine easiest way to force entry When fire has gained headway and threatens escape paths or trapped victims, entry must be forced immediately without concern for damage When finding smoldering fire, building must be ventilated before making entry Once inside building, entry may have to be made to individual units Might have to force doors for later fire fighting Exposed buildings For structures attached to fire building, crews should force entry into buildings on each side of fire building May have to force entry into exposed structures taller than fire building Object of forced entry into exposed buildings to provide access ahead of time Check to be sure that access provided to all parts of building Should not force entry into exposures when force not required Always check entry door before forced since may not be locked Introduction to Overhaul (1-1-3) Main purpose of overhaul to make certain no trace of fire remains to rekindle Second purpose is to leave structure in as safe a condition as possible Overhaul is toughest assignment Requires knowledge of fire travel and building construction Requires expertise in use of overhaul tools Requires stamina and muscle for prolonged periods of hard work Tired crews sometimes try to work too quickly and tend to take chances in effort to get job finished Overhaul begins after emergency over with \nno reason to rush or take chances Pre-Inspection Fire area must be checked thoroughly before sending people into building for overhaul Building might be strained or damaged by weight of water Might be holes in floor or roof Stairways might be hazardous Portion of building might be unsafe to enter Other dangerous conditions could exist Bound to be accidents or injuries unless building is inspected and unsafe areas marked Extent of pre-inspection and overhaul will depend on size of fire Purpose of inspection to make sure area is safe When damage at night fire has been extensive and entire area cannot be lighted, overhaul operation should be delayed until daylight Watch lines should be established to extinguish any fire that might rekindle Procedure for Checking for Rekindle (1-1-4) Indications of rekindling Look for flames, smoke, heat, stronger than normal odor, and areas obviously touched by flames Look for vertical black streaks near baseboards and blistering and discoloration on walls Concealed horizontal and vertical spaces should be checked Portable lights great help in examining concealed spaces or areas that may have to be opened Ceiling, floor, wall or shaft showing signs of fire damage should be checked further If flames, embers, or smoke show when space opened, area should be wet down and further opened Areas of possible rekindling Walls and ceilings If in contact with fire and heat, must be opened and checked If partially opened during fire, open further to find full extent of fire Important to open ceiling space because any fire there will be guided to wall spaces and then up through building Ceiling spaces should be checked with extra care so damage will be minimized - protect building contents Check to see if sparkshave been carried up interior walls or partitions Above fire Remove baseboards for positive check for fire travel through walls and partitions Older walls more susceptible to hidden fire than newer walls Both sides of insulation must be checked When crews find that fire has penetrated ceiling space, must assume fire spread into floor above If part of floor must be removed, take it up until clean areas shows extent of fire In general, cutting during overhaul should be done with power saws Shafts When crews suspect or find fire spread into vertical shafts, they must be opened and checked Shaft openings might have to be enlarged to allow streams to be manipulated properly Check top and bottom of shaft for fire and sparks Shafts opened for venting or fire control must be thoroughly checked Anything in contact with shafts must be thoroughly inspected Cabinets and compartments - if cabinets have been subjected to fire or intense heat, they must be thoroughly checked Window and door facings When fire has involved window or door facing, crews should remove facings and check concealed recesses If extension found, walls or partitions must be opened to end fire travel Wainscoting handled as door facing Basement areas When fire directly involved basement or cellar, area must be checked completely Even if not involved, check for fire that might have fallen from upper levels Party walls must be examined carefully - both sides with special attention to point where joists overlap or abut Chemicals and other hazards Fire fighters should know which chemicals and flammable liquids are kept in storage areas Care must be exercised during firefighting operations for leaking flammables igniting During overhaul, attention must be paid to labels on containers and to signs posted Protective clothing (including SCBA) essential in overhaul
