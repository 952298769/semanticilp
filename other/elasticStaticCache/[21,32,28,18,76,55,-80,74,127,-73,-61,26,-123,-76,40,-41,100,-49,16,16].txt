To find the volume of an irregular shaped object: 1. Fill a container (a graduated cylinder) with enough water to submerge the object 2. Measure the volume of the water 3. Place the object in the water 4. Measure the increase of the volume of the water by subtracting the original volume of water by the new volume of water. 5. The increase in volume is the volume of the object.
