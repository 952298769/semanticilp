combinations every generation so selection has a wide variety of combinations to act on not necessarily limited to the combinations that the parents had next time, we will see that a simple extension of this model also explains two other features of inheritance that are required for Darwin's theory to work: how variation is maintained for \"continuous\" traits, like body size and how some offspring can have characteristics more extreme than their parents like a 6 foot tall son of two parents who were both only 5 foot 8 inches tall and finally, next time we will also see how Mendel's
