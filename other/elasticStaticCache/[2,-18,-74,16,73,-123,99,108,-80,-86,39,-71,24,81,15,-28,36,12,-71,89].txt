For example, mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus) migrate from intermediate elevations in summer to high elevations in winter ( Poole et al. 2000 ). An unusual pattern of seasonal migration along altitudinal gradients was recently observed among golden takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), which are endemic to the Qinling Mountains of China ( Zeng et al. 2008 ). They live mostly in groups larger than 10 individuals, but occasionally solitary animals can be observed in the field ( Zeng et al. 1998 , 2002 ). They forage on >160 species of plants, including mosses, ferns, herbs, shrubs, and trees ( Zeng et al. 2001 ). Their rutting season occurs in summer from June to August, and their calves are born in winter in February and March ( Wang et al. 2005 , 2006 ). Golden takin migrate to different elevations 4 times a year, remaining at high elevations (2,200–2,800 m) in summer, at intermediate elevations (1,900–2,400 m) in winter, and at low elevations (1,400–1,900 m) for short periods in both spring and autumn ( Zeng et al. 2008 ).

Spring migration begins as early as mid-February and is typically completed by June [ 58 , 69 , 80 ]. Early spring thaws allow caribou to migrate to calving grounds early, while late-melting snow packs can delay migrations for a full month [ 103 ]. All adult males as well as females that have not successfully bred begin the spring migration in June, often when pregnant females and their yearlings have already reached the calving grounds [ 69 ]. A sudden decrease in caribou movements occurs during calving [ 39 ]. Winter migrations commence by late September or October. Breeding in migratory herds occurs early into the winter migration [ 103 ]. Caribou often follow the same migration routes year after year [ 58 ]. For herds summering in northern tundra, forested wintering grounds are up to 800 miles (1,300 km) away.
