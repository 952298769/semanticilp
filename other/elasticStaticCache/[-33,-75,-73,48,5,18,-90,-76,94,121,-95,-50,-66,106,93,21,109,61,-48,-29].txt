I just bought my son some fancy guppies, he had a Betta, but he grew really bad fungus in just 24 hours and died. This isn't the first time this has happened to the kids with Bettas, so I figured I would try a different kind of fish. Guppies were my next choice because they are equally as colorful, you can keep more than one, and the kids would get to see their babies.     Anyhow, this one male, I believe to be a red neon guppy after searching all over the place trying to find a picture that was similar, although his tail is variegated, not solid red, does NOT have a top fin on his back. He has a chunk out of his tail as well, (the guppies were in a tank with BARBS of all fish, He is swimming around fine, eating like a pig, like he has NEVER  been fed in his life, but has no top fin. Was it bitten completely off? Is this a genetic mutation? Will it grow back? His back is completely smooth, there is NO evidence of a fin ever being there. But the other guppies, we have 2 trios (4 all together) in 2 separate tanks (I have 3 kids and one on the way) and ALL of the other guppies have fins on their back. This male is very pretty and once his tail grows back, will be stunning, I was just wondering about the back fin. He looks odd without it compared to the other guppies. Also, one of the females I noticed today (it's been  2 days since we got the fish) has a small whitish speck on her tail where it was also bitten. She was in a tank with all of the other fish, as she is with 3 other females and 2 males right now. Nobody else has any  specks.  It seems to definitely be related to the fact that her tail was  bitten and has formed some sort of scarring/parasite right there. Should I treat?  I have a medicine called Quick Cure that is for protozoan and parasite infestations.  Ingredients are Formalin and malachite green. She doesn't seem distressed at all, but I don't want it getting out of hand and spreading to the other fish. Especially since most if not all of them do have slight tears in their tails from the constant tiger barb harassment. Thanks so much for your time, you have the best site for questions and information regarding all aspects of fish keeping. Thanks so much for your time. Cheers. Jennifer in Maryland, USA <Hi Jennifer, Don here. The missing fin sounds genetic since you see no scar. If so, it will not grow back. But as long as he's healthy he'll be fine without it. Torn, bitten fins will grow back unless they are lost all the way down to the skin. The white spot may be dead, or growing, tissue. However if you see more, salt-like spots then your fish have Ick, a parasite that can kill. The med you have will clear it, but is very harsh. I would not use it unless we are sure it's Ick. I prefer to use salt to clear Ick. A little salt will also help the fins regrow. The Betta problems you had sounds like pH shock. If the pH of their old water is off more than a few tenths from their new home you need to add tank water to the bag slowly over an hour or two to allow him to adjust>  ",0.7146521210670471],["00:00:32:08NICK HARDCASTLE:Boo! (Laughs) Did I scare you? A garden in the dark. How very mysterious! This is a mushroom farm, and this is how they're grown - in the dark. But don't all plants need light to survive? Well, that's just it - mushrooms aren't plants. They're part of a whole separate kingdom of living things known as fungi. Kind of like myself, you know? A bit of a fun guy. Anyway, unlike green plants, mushies can't draw energy from sunlight to make their own food. No, they grow in the dark, feeding on rotting organic matter like the compost in this bag here. Yes, fungi are very strange and weird things, but it's not just mushies. It's those strange-looking toadstools you sometimes come across. Bracket fungi grow on trees or dead logs in the rainforest. Truffles grow underground on trees. They're sniffed out by specially trained dogs and are one of the most expensive foods in the world. Icky and itchy little skin infections are fungi, as are all those weird, hairy-looking moulds that grow bread and food scraps. And the most useful of all is a mould called penicillin, which is used as a lifesaving medicine and can kill harmful germs. In a mushroom farm, everything needs to be kept super clean, as mushrooms are spread by tiny spores. These bags of sawdust compost are cleaned by super-hot steam. Mushroom spores are added in a special clean room. The growing sheds are kept dark and steamy warm. After a few weeks, the first growth, or flush, is picked. More are harvested from the same bag in another week, and this goes on until the nutrients in the compost bag are exhausted. Have a look at this beautiful honey-brown mushroom. Great set of gills here. And there's no roots, no leaves, no flowers. In fact, it's not really like a plant at all. And the mushroom itself isn't even the fungi. The mushroom is the fruit of the fungi, which actually takes the shape of little tiny tubes underneath the ground here feeding on this organic matter to produce the mushroom, which is 90% water. I did an experiment where we chopped off the stalk of the mushroom and put the cap down on white paper, covering it with a bowl and leaving it overnight. It produces these great patterns. You can see the spores that come out of these gills. You should give it a go. The white mushroom is the most widely grown in the world. These are shiitake, or forest mushrooms from Japan. Oyster mushrooms come in a whole range of forms and colours. The shades are altered by the amount of light they're grown in. The black oyster mushroom feels almost like velvet. Mushrooms are weird-looking things, but they make great eating. However, you should never pick mushrooms in the wild, whether they're in your front yard or in the bush, because some can be poisonous, even deadly. So just stick to your grocery store. Goodnight, little fella. Of course, there is an alternative to buying your mushrooms from the grocery store, and that is to grow your own.

Pick them gently with a bit of a twist. More will grow as you pick them. When they stop growing, use the compost on your garden. Worms love it. Now we have to find the perfect spot for our mushroom farm.
