poison glands provide protection from predators, dessication, mechanical damage paired fins are replaced by paired limbs (arms and legs) with digits (fingers and toes) body form varies among groups: salamanders have long, slender body with distinct neck, tail frogs have compact bodies with reduced trunks, long legs modified for jumping, no tails in adults caecilians have long, slender bodies
