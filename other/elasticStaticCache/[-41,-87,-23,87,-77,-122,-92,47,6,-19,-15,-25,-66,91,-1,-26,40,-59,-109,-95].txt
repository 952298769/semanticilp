[["THE ORGANISM: There are several Schistosoma species which affect humans; all have the same basic lifestyle. Eggs hatch if they reach water, and a swimming larva finds and penetrates certain species of snails (each species of Schistosome has a particular snail species that it uses). A couple of reproductive phases occur in the snail, and eventually another swimming stage emerges. This larva actively seeks out exposed skin and penetrates it, entering the bloodstream and migrating to the liver, where it matures into an adult flatworm. The adults move into veins on the linings of the intestines and bladder (different species have different preferences), where they mate and the females produce eggs. In most species, these eggs have spines so that they can tear out of the small blood vessels into the intestine or bladder, where they can be carried out of the body.",1.1613065004348755],["REMARKS In addition to the fact that smaller and not-so-glamorous forms of life are just as important as larger, more attractive species, an important point to bring out in the whole-class discussion of this activity is the importance of plant life, i.e., that all living things depend on plants for food, shelter, and many other products.",1.1147065162658691],["Activities such as eating, seeking shelter and migration alone account for a great number of patches.",1.1040325164794922],["Today we repeat our invitation to all Mexican men and women to form brigades of publicity and to promote the carrying out of this democratic mobilization, which seeks only two things: the recognition of indigenous rights and peace in Mexico.",1.0758172273635864],["Alternately, when the environment changes, species can migrate to suitable climes or seek out microenvironments to which they are adapted.",1.0410447120666504],["Alternately, when the environment changes, species can migrate to suitable climes or seek out microenvironments to which they are adapted.",1.0410447120666504],["Alternately, when the environment changes, species can migrate to suitable climes or seek out microenvironments to which they are adapted.",1.0410447120666504],["Salamanders live in rivers, swamps, forests and caves.
