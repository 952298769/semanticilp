The rest of the soil (or clay particles) may take the next couple of days to a week to settle depending on the amount of clay in the sample. But because you know that each sample started with 1 inch you can determine the amount of clay because you know the amount of organic matter that is floating on top (this may be difficult to measure), sand, and silt.9. Convert the measurements into percentages. Students may need help with this. If you used 1 inch of soil and the first layer measured 1/2 an inch, that would be equal to 50% sand, a 1/4 inch measured in the second layer would be 25% silt, and the remainder would be 25% clay, to make 100%. If the sample has 5% organic mater, you may only have 20% clay. If you started with 4 inches of soil and 2 inches settled out as sand, 50% of that sample would be sand, 1-inch of silt would be 25%, 1-inch of clay would be evaluated as 25% clay.10. Determine the soil type by using the Texture Triangle transparency.Discussion1. Why do the larger particles settle out first?2. What is the stuff floating in the jar?3. How does each persons sample compare?Activity 2 - Soil Textures By FeelClassroom management note for Activity 2: Divide the class into groups of four. Inviteeach group, one at a time, back to the table where the soil samples are set up in the bowlson newspaper. Cover the entire surface with newspaper. Place a bucket of water on thetable for rinsing hands between texturing samples. Have paper towels available for the finalrinse and dry. The bucket of water should be placed in the middle of the table so muddyhands will not have a chance of being hung out over the floor. Before students rinse theirhands, as much of the sample as possible should be returned to the sample bowl. Handsmust be rinsed between samples so as not to confuse the sampler, and mix up the samplefor the following students. While each group is working at the texture sampling area,provide the other students with some other type of “at your desk” activity. You may want tohave them work on a crossword or word search puzzle provided in the back of this guide.The teacher should try to remain with the texturing group as much as possible to guidethem through the activity and clarify questions the students may have.1. Place at least three different soil types into four bowls. (a sand, silt, and clay, loam).2. Introduce the soil “Textural Triangle.” Show the students there are different names for different types of soil. It will be the task of your students to determine the texture of the supplied soil samples.Utah Agriculture in the Classroom20",1.257015585899353],["As a basis for understanding this concept: a.

decomposing plant and animal remains.  A \"loam soil\" is a mix of sand, silt, and clay that optimizes agricultural productivity.  The texture of a soil determines much about the water retention properties.  A \"coarse soil\", mostly sand & gravel, has large pore spaces and allows water to easily run through it beyond the reach of roots.  These soils tend to be drought-prone.  Additionally, sand and gravel have relatively little surface area for the particle volume, reducing the potential for nutrient weathering.  A \"fine soil\" has large components of silt and clay, making it \"muddy\" when wet.  Pore spaces are smaller and hold more water.  However, when clay soils begin to dry, they may still hold large quantities of water, but due to the small particle size and adhesive & cohesive properties of water, most of it will be unavailable for root uptake. ",0.9905970096588135],["This is supported by the texture, which is clay and only clay.",0.97400963306427],["When the
