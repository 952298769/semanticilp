[["Outcomes: Upon completion of the course the student should: know the anatomy of all the organ systems of a typical bird and how these organ systems function understand what avian anatomical modifications are adaptations to flight understand the mechanisms of flight and specializations for other kinds of locomotion (walking, swimming) understand thermoregulation in birds understand photoperiodism, migration, and orientation in birds know the difference between ultimate and proximate factors in establishing timing of migration, breeding, etc understand basic bird behavior, including that related to feeding, breeding, and social interactions understand avian breeding biology from initiation of territoriality (in the species which exhibit it) through pair formation and raising of young get a basic understanding of population regulation of birds know bird topography, general avian feather tract patterns, feather types, feather structure, and how feather colors are determined know the avian skeleton, and its compnent parts, and know what skeletal modifications are adaptations for flight know the anatomy of the pigeon and what departures from the general vertebrate pattern are peculiar to birds and which ones are adaptive to a flying vertebrate be able to identify study skins of about 200 Pennsylvania bird species know sex, age, and seasonal differences in plumage where these exist know the higher taxonomic categories to which the specimens belong and understand what these reveal about the relationships between the birds and their relationships to other animals be able to identify by sight many of the bird species present in western Pennsylvania know how to identify some western Pennsylvania species by call or song learn the habitat requirements and behavioral patterns of many western Pennsylvania species learn to observe birds carefully, accurately, and in detail (as evidence of this ability the student will keep a field notebook and hand in field notes) the student will select a topic on some aspect of avian biology, carry out a field project, and write a scientific report on the project using the correct methods for writing scientific papers.",1.7089524269104004],["Describe in general its structure and function.",1.6258383989334106],["Describe in general its structure and function.",1.6258383989334106],["A general reform was proposed of its internal functioning structure.",1.3935757875442505],["What is the general role of the crop in birds, and how is its structure related to diet?",1.3901954889297485],["In general, EPoX EP-7KXA is an ordinary working product, aimed at nothing exalted, which fulfils its functions 100% correctly.",1.3460129499435425],["This is to mark putative homologues, or in general, to put different emphasis on a pair, which may be correct and another which clearly is not correct.",1.3172003030776978],["In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of stanzas of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical with the stanza in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character.",1.2681057453155518],["X1013064493-00102-28351</DOCNO> The Bag Structure and its Associated Functions Next: Sets and their Manipulation Functions Up: ASSIST : A General Purpose Facility for REDUCE Previous: Manipulation of the List Structure The Bag Structure and its Associated Functions The LIST structure of REDUCE is very convenient to manipulate groups of objects which are, a priori, unknown.",1.2571156024932861],["The father of general semantics, Alford Korzybski stated, &quot;A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness&quot;.",1.2535169124603271],["In general, using cons to construct lists will result in an interlinked structure of pairs in which many individual pairs are shared by many different structures.",1.2508115768432617],["We present general techniques for constructing simple to program self-testing/correcting pairs for a variety of numerical functions.",1.2342451810836792],["We present general techniques for constructing simple to program self-testing/correcting pairs for a variety of numerical functions.",1.2342451810836792],["SALIVARY GLANDS A.
