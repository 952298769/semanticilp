the release of this energy may cause the ground to shake or tremble during an earthquake 3 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES 1) tectonic forces slowly deform the crust along faults or folds, the rocks bend and store elastic energy 2) frictional forces holding the blocks together are often overcome by slippage along the fault 3) slippage allows the rock to elastically return to its original shape producing vibrations earthquakes 4 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR EARTHQUAKES 1) movement of crustal blocks (plate boundaries) - the earth is divided into plates that move and interact at plate boundaries - Plate boundaries are the places where most earthquake occur 2) igneous activities (explosive volcanism) 3) nuclear explosions 5 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Sequence of Earthquake Generation 1) Foreshocks (small earthquakes that precede the main quake) 2) Main earthquake 3) Aftershocks (small earthquakes that follow the main quake) 6 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Seismology: The study of earthquake waves Seismograph: Device used to detect and record seismic waves Consists of: 1) seismometer - instrument for detecting seismic waves 2) seismogram - the record of seismic waves 7 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Seismograph Principle of operation - based on the inertia of a suspended mass. Mode of operation 1) horizontal mode - records horizontal vibrations (E-W and N-S directions) 2) vertical mode - records vertical (up and down motions) 8 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Types of Seismic Waves 1) Body Waves - compressional (pressure) waves (P waves) - shear waves (S waves) 2) Surface Waves - Rayleigh Waves (L waves) All seismic waves are determined from the seismic record (seismogram) 9 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE Locating the Earthquake Source Focus - the point at which seismic wave originate (point of initial movement of a fault) Epicenter - location on the surface directly above the earthquake focus 10 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Locating the Distance to the Earthquake Epicenter - based on the difference in arrival time between the P and S waves - difference in arrival time is determined from a plot of time versus distance (travel time graph) - based on earthquake wave velocities difference in arrival time = distance to epicenter 11 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Locating the Earthquake Epicenter - requirement: 3 or more seismic stations 1) determine the distance of the epicenter from travel time graphs 2) to determine location of epicenter, draw circles with a radii = distances to epicenter 3) the intersection of the circles is the location of the source (epicenter) 12 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES Earthquake Belts 1) 95% of earthquake energy is released along plate margins (Circum-Pacific Belt, the Mediterranean-Himalayan Belt, the Mid-Ocean Ridges) 2) Intra-Plate earthquake energy is released along faults (New Madrid Fault - Missouri (1811-12), Charleston, South Carolina (1886) 13 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DEPTHS Evidence from seismic records indicate that earthquakes originate from depths of 5 to 700 km I- shallow focus earthquakes - depth of &lt; 70 km - Richter magnitude 8.6 - common along all plate boundaries 14 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DEPTHS II- intermediate focus earthquakes - depth of 70 - 300 km - Richter magnitude 7.5 III- deep focus earthquakes - depth of 300 - 700 km - Richter magnitude 6.9 - common along convergent boundaries [circum pacific belt (landward of deep ocean

Intensity A measure of the effect of an earthquake at a location The measured intensity depends on: 1) the total amount of energy released 2) the distance from the epicenter 3) nature of the surface material 4) the building design 18 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE INTENSITY Mercalli Scale - this scale rates earthquake intensity by determining the amount of damage to structures Problems - with today's modern structural design, it would be hard to use this scale 19 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE Earthquake Magnitude - measures the strength of an earthquake (the amount of energy released) 20 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE Earthquake Magnitude Richter Scale - magnitude of an earthquake is determined from measurement of the amplitude of the surface waves - the Richter Scale is Logarithmic to accommodate a wide variation in earthquake magnitudes 21 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES MEASURING EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE The Richter Scale 1) there is a tenfold increase in wave amplitude corresponding to an increase of one unit on the magnitude scale e.g. 4.5 - 5.5 implies 5.5 has 10 times 4.5 amplitude 2) there is a 32-fold increase in the amount of energy released for each unit increase in the magnitude scale e.g. 6.0 - 7.0 implies 7.0 has 32 times more energy 22 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The nature of earthquake destruction depends on: 1) magnitude of the earthquake 2) rock type 3) proximity to population centers 23 CHAPTER 16 EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE DESTRUCTION The amount of structural damage attributable to vibration from earthquakes depend on: 1) the intensity and duration of the vibrations (e.g. Anchorage vs San Francisco) 2) the nature of the material upon which the structures rests -
