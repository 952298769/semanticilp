australopithecines or early Homo could hunt effectively it would seem that a slow, weak primate with small canines would not be an effective hunter without significant intelligence, tools, and language to coordinate a group hunt but now we know that chimps regularly hunt in groups, without weapons, language, or big brains so maybe australopithecines and/or early Homo could, too it also used to be thought that australopithecines or early Homo might have gotten meat (and left crude tools lying around among the bones) by scavenging carcasses left by other predators but now we know that chimps eat meat, but almost never scavenge... so maybe australopithecines and early Homo didn't either of course, these chimp analogies are not conclusive, since our ancestors were different from chimps australopithecines and early Homo did not have the large canines of chimps so they were even less physically equipped to hunt australopithecines and early Homo were efficient bipeds, where chimps waste a lot of energy moving on the ground so they could follow game for long distances, maybe even walk wounded animals to death in that sense they were better equipped to hunt than are chimps australopithecines may have been a little smarter... so maybe this would compensate for the wimpy canines, permitting hunting or maybe their intelligence and efficient terrestrial locomotion would have helped them find and defend carcasses to scavenge more effectively than chimps could, making scavenging a more viable option for them archaeological evidence might indicate hunting, or lack of it starting around 2.5 mya, some creature made and used simple stone tools by 2.4 mya, there are places (\"sites\") where Oldowan style flaked stone tools are found together with fossilized animal bones some sites have remains of a single large animal, others are mixes of several species hippos, elephants, giraffe, etc. but especially antelopes, gazelles, sheep, goats, wild cattle with flakes, cores, and hammerstones hammerstones are rocks that are struck against other stones to knock flakes off of them often made of stone that had to have been brought from kilometers away initially, there were doubts about whether these sites \nreally resulted from hominid activity maybe the bone and the artifacts were not originally associated, but were rolled along by water and were deposited together, or some similar natural process maybe hominids came by and dropped the tools after the animals had died and the meat was long since gone but many of these doubts have been put to rest by careful studies the soil of the sites was not deposited by moving water at many sites, the bones show characteristic cutmarks from stone tools, proving that hominids cut sinews or meat off the bones using stone tools the cutmarks can be clearly distinguished from the scratches caused by carnivore teeth or other natural causes conclusions these \"sites\" really are the traces of activities of early hominids the early hominids really did eat meat and they made and used stone tools to cut up carcasses but we don't know if this was common or a rare event the next question: did the hominids hunt the animals, or
