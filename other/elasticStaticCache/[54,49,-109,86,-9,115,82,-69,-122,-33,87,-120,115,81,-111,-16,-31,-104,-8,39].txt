Chemical weathering is the breakdown of a substance by decomposition resulting in the formation of new mineral matter--water and acids especially carbonic acid (H2CO3) are important agents in this type of weathering Kinds of chemical weathering hydrolysis--is the chemical reaction of water with the substance in which the (OH) in water (HOH) becomes part of the new formed substance-- often silicate minerals will weather this way to form clays solution (leaching)--is the dissolving of substances by acid in waters usually leaving residual nonsolubilized materials--carbonate minerals are especially affected by leaching oxidation--is the reaction of a substance with oxygen causing a rust to form--manganese (Mn) and especially iron (Fe) minerals are affected although there are individual chemical and physical weathering types often combinations of these can affect the total weathering of a substance III.",1.491644024848938],["Example: Rusting of iron: Iron + air (oxygen) = iron oxide Review chapter 1 Physical changes A physical change involves a change in one or more physical properties, but no change in composition (nature) of the matter.",1.2961621284484863],["X1011569478-00264-67640</DOCNO> Physical and Chemical Changes Quiz 1 (Grade 4) 1001 Periodic Table Quiz Questions Quiz about the differences between physical and chemical changes Home | Grade 4 Quizzes Physical and Chemical Changes Quiz 1 1) Pick an example of a physical change below: iron that rusts sugar that dissolves in water 2) Pick an example of a chemical change below: sand mixed with water iron that gets magnetized a silver spoon tarnishes water that condenses 3) A physical change means that no new substance is formed True False 4) Breaking water up by separating it into oxygen and hydrogen is an example of a ......",1.2307883501052856],["F Rusting is a physical change.",1.2138824462890625]]
