mitochondria Generates ATP Electrons (accompanied by protons) donated to oxygen gas to form water Carbon atoms cleaved, released as carbon dioxide Process Consumes Oxygen and Generate Carbon Dioxide and Water Called metabolic water to emphasize its source Provides sole source of water for some desert vertebrates Diluted into body internal water in other organisms Carbon dioxide can lower pH of body fluid and must be eliminated External respiration: uptake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide THE COMPOSITION OF AIR Composition and Properties of Air All oxygen in the air is a result of photosynthesis Dry air = 78.09% N2 + 20.95% O2 + 0.93% (argon + inert gases) + 0.03 CO2 Amount of air present decreases at high altitudes fig 46.1 At sea level, air pressure measures 760 mm of mercury fig 46.2 Equals the barometric pressure of air Equivalent to one atmosphere of pressure Each gas within the air exerts a partial pressure = 760 x % gas Nitrogen + inert gases = 760 x 79.02% = 600.6 mm Hg Oxygen = 760 x 20.95% = 159.2 mm Hg Carbon dioxide = 760 x 0.03% = 0.2 mm Hg Less air, therefore less oxygen present at high altitudes Barometric pressure above 6000 meters = 380 mm Hg Partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)= 380 x 20.95% = 80 mm Hg Only half the oxygen is available compared to sea level The Diffusion of Gases Across Cell Membranes Cell membranes of terrestrial organisms \nfreely permeable to oxygen Cell membranes cannot exist without a surrounding layer of water Oxygen concentration in cytoplasm lower than liquid surrounding cells Net diffusion of oxygen from environment into cells Net diffusion of carbon dioxide in opposite direction Gases redistributed by circulatory system Fick's Law of Diffusion Diffusion of oxygen into the epithelial aqueous layer is passive Driven by the difference in oxygen concentration between the interior of the organism and the external environment Mathematical relationship called Fick`s Law of Diffusion R = D x A x &Delta;p / d R = rate of diffusion D = diffusion constant A = area over which diffusion takes place &Delta;p = difference in partial pressures on each side d = distance across which diffusion takes place Evolutionary changes optimize R by favoring certain parameters fig 46.3 Increase surface area Decrease distance d Increase concentration difference &Delta;p THE EVOLUTION OF EXTERNAL RESPIRATION fig 46.5 Simple Diffusion Oxygen diffuses too slowly to be efficient over more than 0.5 mm Severely limits size of organisms Protists are small enough to utilize simple diffusion fig 46.3 As size increases, surface area-to volume ratio decreases Surface area proportional to radius squared (r2) Volume proportional to radius cubed (r 3) Surface area-to-volume ratio proportional to r2/r3 or 1/r As the radius increases the ratio decreases Metabolism may be slowed down to compensate Increase in size must be accompanied by facilitation of diffusion of oxygen into organism Creating a Water Current Most primitive phyla possess no special respiratory organs Can obtain oxygen via diffusion by increasing &Delta;p in Fick`s equation Increase difference in O2 concentration by creating a water current Constantly replace water over diffusion surface &Delta;p does not decrease as diffusion proceeds Keep exterior O2 concentration high Results in higher realized value of R, rate of diffusion Increasing the Diffusion Surface Area More advanced invertebrates and vertebrates possess respiratory organs Increase surface area over which diffusion occurs Provides contact between external environment and internal circulating fluids Increase A and decreasing d Aquatic organs (gills) project from body into water Simple gills like papulae of echinoderms fig 46.3c Convoluted gills of fish fig 46.3e Increase in diffusion surface area enables aquatic organisms to extract more oxygen Enclosing the Gills Disadvantage of external gills Difficult to constantly circulate water past diffusion surface Neotenic amphibian larvae physically move gill through water fig 46.4 Inefficient, highly branched gills offer resistance against movement Special branchial chambers in other organisms pump water past gills Internal mantle cavity of mollusks opens to outside, contains gills Contraction of muscular walls draws water in and expels it Crustacean cavity lies between body and hard exoskeleton Movement of limbs draws water through branchial chamber THE FISH GILL AS AN AQUATIC RESPIRATORY MACHINE Most Successful Branchial Chamber Evolved in Bony Fishes Water passes through mouth into two opercular cavities Gills are located between mouth and entrance to cavity Water then passes out of body after passing over gills and through cavity One-way flow of water over gills Maintains high concentration of oxygen outside gills Continuously swimming fish have nearly immovable gill covers Water constantly forced over gills as fish swim Process is a form of ram ventilation Most bony fish have flexible gill covers fig 46.5 Inhales water into mouth Exhales water over gills and through opercular cavities Effects of Gill Construction on Parameters of Diffusion Structure of gills fig 46.6 Each gill composed of two rows of gill filaments that project into flow of water Filaments divided into thin, disk-like lamellae that lie parallel to water flow Direction of blood circulation runs opposite that of water flow Countercurrent flow maximizes &Delta;p between water and blood Advantage of countercurrent exchange fig 46.7a Least oxygenated blood meets least oxygenated water at back of gill Most oxygenated blood meets most oxygenated water at front of gill Diffusion occurs along entire length of gill If water and blood flowed in the same direction Oxygen-free blood would meet highly oxygenated water Diffusion would initially be high fig 46.7b Oxygenated blood would meet less oxygenated water at back of gill Diffusion would cease, only front part of gill would be functional Fish gills are up to 85% efficient FROM AQUATIC TO ATMOSPHERIC BREATHING More Oxygen Present in Air Than in Water Water = 5-10 ml O2 per 1 liter water Air = 210 ml of O2 per 1 liter air Many aquatic animals use air as their oxygen source Gills Not Adaptable for Terrestrial Use Air is less buoyant than water Lamellae lack structural support, collapse without water buoyancy Collapse reduces diffusion surface area Internal air passages remain open due to structural support Water diffuses into air through evaporation Terrestrial organisms constantly lose water to atmosphere Gills provide an enormous surface area for water loss Evolved two main kinds of terrestrial respiratory organs Both systems sacrifice efficiency to reduce water loss Tracheae of insects fig 46.3d Extensive series of air-filled passages within body Oxygen diffuses directly from trachea to cells, no circulatory intervention Openings close when CO2 levels are below certain point to limit water loss Lungs of terrestrial vertebrates Air enters and exits through one tube, minimizes evaporation Two-way flow of air replaces one-way flow Diffusion surfaces not exposed to pure fresh air &Delta;p is far from maximal, lungs are less efficient than gills Amphibians Low efficiency of lungs offset by high concentration of oxygen Efficiency not a critical problem to early land vertebrates Structure of the amphibian respiratory system fig 46.8 Lung is a simple convoluted sac Connected by trachea (windpipe) to rear of oral cavity (mouth) Opening controlled by glottis, sinuses connect oral cavity to nose Much oxygen obtained by diffusion across moist skin, cutaneous respiration Reptiles More active, greater metabolic need for oxygen Cannot obtain oxygen through watertight skin surface Changes within the reptile respiratory system Lungs possess small air chambers fig 46.8b \nLarger surface area for diffusion Mammals Metabolic demands even greater due to maintaining constant body temperature Lungs more highly branched with more alveoli clusters fig 46.8c Each alveoli cluster connected to main air passageway by short bronchiole All gas exchange occurs across walls of alveoli fig 46.3f Branching and alveoli vastly increase total surface area Humans have 300 million alveoli in two lungs Area about 42 times the surface area of body Active mammals do not have greater lung mass Have smaller, more numerous alveoli Thinner epithelial layer separates alveoli from blood Birds Metabolism of flying necessitates a more efficient respiratory system Avian lung works like a two-cycle pump fig 46.9 With inhalation air passes into posterior air sacs With exhalation air flows into lung With next inhalation, that air passes from lung to anterior air sacs Air flows out of the body with next exhalation Air flow is unidirectional from posterior to anterior Birds have no \"dead volume\" of air remaining in lungs as do mammals Air at the diffusing surface of the lung is fully oxygenated Direction of air flow is different from the flow of blood fig 46.10 Flow of air and blood are at 90% angles to one another Called cross-current flow Less efficient than fish, more efficient than mammals Birds can survive in much higher altitudes than mammals Birds increase &Delta;p value in Fick`s equation THE STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS OF THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Structure of the Respiratory Tree Air normally enters through nostrils Lined with hairs to filter out dust Extensive array of cilia further cleans and moistens air fig 46.11 Air passes through glottis Slit in larynx (voice box) Enters trachea, branches into two bronchi one for each lung fig 46.12 Bronchi further branch into smaller tubes, narrowest called bronchioles Trachea and bronchi reinforced with cartilaginous rings Bronchioles have only smooth muscle in walls Smooth muscle lining adjusts size of passageway Contraction stimulated by parasympathetic division of the nervous system Decrease in diameter by half increases resistance sixteen fold Sympathetic division relaxes smooth muscle, causes bronchodilation, decreases resistance Bronchodilation also caused by epinephrine Drug used to treat symptoms of asthma triggered by release of histamine The Structure of the Lung Terminal bronchioles deliver air to respiratory bronchioles Contain alveoli where gas exchange occurs Alveoli are outpouchings surrounded by capillaries Lines by epithelium only one cell layer thick Outside of lungs covered by visceral pleural membrane Inner wall of thoracic cavity lined by parietal pleural membrane Space between membranes called the pleural cavity Normally small and filled with fluid Fluid links membranes together like water film holds two sheets of cellophane together Lungs held tight to thoracic cavity Each lung has own pleural cavity, if one punctured other lung functional Air Flow in the Lung Human lung functions as one-cycle pump During inhalation or inspiration Rib external intercostal muscles contract raising the ribs fig 46.13 Diaphragm contracts, lowers and flattens Increases volume of thorax Due to coupling of pleural membranes, volume of lungs also increases Pressure of air in lungs decreases, air drawn into lungs fig 46.14 During exhalation or expiration Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax Structures of thorax return to previous condition Volume of thorax and lungs decreases Increases pressure of air in lungs, air forced out Extra air can be forced out of lungs Contraction of internal intercostal muscles lowers ribs Diaphragm pushed further up into thoracic cavity fig 46.13b Air volumes of human lungs Tidal volume: volume inspired and expired in a single breath About 500 ml of air Anatomical dead space: 150 ml within air passages Can be increased to 3000 ml during exercise Diffusion surface of lungs exposed to mixture of fresh and oxygen-depleted air Functional residual capacity (FRC): volume in lung after normal resting expiration Residual volume: volume in lung after maximal expiration Vital capacity: amount of air expired after forceful, maximum inspiration Emphysema reduces vital capacity Alveoli destroyed by cigarette smoking Respiratory rate: number of breaths per unit time Minute respiratory volume (MRV) Equals tidal volume x respiratory rate per minute Air entering and leaving lung per minute Normally 5 liters/minute, can be as high as 130 liters/minute Conditions associated with abnormal P CO2 Hyperventilation MRV extremely high CO2 removed from blood by ventilation faster than its produced by tissues Hypoventilation MRV unusually low Elevated P CO2 level Hyperpnea High MRV, high metabolic rate Normal blood P CO2 level GAS TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE Association of Respiratory and Circulatory Systems Transport of oxygen extremely slow if only by diffusion Transported through circulatory system via carrier Blood plasma holds maximum of 3 ml O2/liter Whole blood is able to carry 200 ml O2/liter Hemoglobin: oxygen carrier protein within the blood of most animals Four polypeptide subunit protein Each subunit combines with iron containing heme group fig 46.15 Hemoglobin picks up oxygen in lungs Bright red color when bound with oxygen Called oxyhemoglobin Hemoglobin releases oxygen at tissues Called deoxyhemoglobin Dark red color, looks blue under skin Hemoglobin widely distributed oxygen carrier protein throughout animal kingdom Hemocyanin: second carrier protein found in many invertebrates Uses copper instead of iron Does not occur within blood cells, exists free in hemolymph Oxygen Transport At P O2 of 100 mm Hg, 97% bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells Percent saturation in arterial blood is 97% at sea level Extracellular fluid surrounding tissues has lower P O2 Oxygen diffuses from capillaries into tissues P O2 of venous blood is 40 mm hg, percent saturation is 75% Graphical representation is an oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve fig 46.16a At rest, 22% (97-75) of the oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen to tissues One fifth of oxygen unloaded in tissues, four-fifths in blood as reserve Blood can additionally supply oxygen needs at exercise If venous blood P O2 is 20 mm Hg, saturation is 35% fig 46.16b Amount unloaded now 62% (97-35) Blood contains reserves for 4-5 \nminutes without breathing Presence of CO2 at metabolizing tissues Combines with water to form carbonic acid, lowers pH of blood Occurs in red blood cells, hemoglobin has less affinity for oxygen Hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily Dissociation curve shifted to right, called Bohr effect fig 46.17 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (DPG) also shifts curve to right fig 46.17 Also augments unloading of oxygen Production inhibited by oxyhemoglobin Anything that reduces oxyhemoglobin causes production of DPG Example: high altitudes Low P O2 of air lowers level of oxyhemoglobin Immediately causes rapid fatigue Red cells produce DPG after a few days, shifts curve to right Stimulates unloading of oxygen, lessens fatigue After a few weeks, kidneys produce erythropoietin Stimulates bone marrow to produce more red cells Hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide (CO) Binding to CO more efficient than to O2 CO
