[["Life processes- when we are dealing with life processes, the 1st process we should deal with is Nutrition. 1. Nutrition- obtaining and processing food. - There are two types o…f nutrition a. Autotrophs 1. Self feeders- Example- green plants. They make their own food from simple (inorganic) materials. 2. They carry out food by photosynthesis- light- they make something using light. - Chemosynthesis- carried out by things that live deep in the ocean- using chemicals to make something. b. Heterotrophs 1. Other feeders- animals. They obtain preformed food from others. 2. They carry out food by a. Ingest- take the food in b. Digest- to brake down the food c. Egest- eliminating unprocessed waste. 2. Transport- absorb and circulate (distribute) 3. Respiration- release of energy from food. (Oxidation- burning of food.) 4. Excretion- removal of processed (metabolic) wastes. What body part has this role? The kidneys. 5. Synthesis- root syn- together. Small molecules are put together to form/make larger ones. 6. Growth- organism increase in size. 7. Regulation- control and coordination- Communication is included. 8. Reproduction- production of new individuals. Why was reproduction written last as it has anything to do with the others? Why did scientists include this? Reproduction is not necessary for the individual. It is necessary for the preservation of the species B. Metabolism- all of the life processes- life activities. C. Homeostasis- living organisms must remain in homeostasis. If they don't, they are ill or they are dead. Homeostasis- same stationary condition- steady state- organisms need to maintain a steady state despite an ever-changing internal and external environment. How do we maintain balance?

These are all “organic molecules”, and are composed of at least carbon and hydrogen. Animals obtain organic molecules by eating other organisms – and these molecules are referred to as “food”. Animals are referred to as “heterotrophs” because the are nourished (“troph”) by eating others (“hetero”). food Plants obtain organic molecules by synthesizing them in the process of photosynthesis. They use light as an energy source. In the process they remove hydrogens from water, release oxygen gas, and convert carbon dioxide to sugars and other organic molecules by adding the hydrogens from water. Plants are referred to as “autotrophs” because they are nourished (“troph”) by making their own organic molecules (“auto”).

Type of cell division called meiosis. genetically different eggs genetically different sperm Usually 1 matures each month Gentically different egg and sperm – each with 23 chromosomes (produced by meiosis) Fertilized egg with 46 chromosomes – 23 from the egg and 23 from the sperm Gentically different egg and sperm – each with 23 chromosomes (produced by meiosis) Fertilized egg begins to divide by mitosis Fertilized egg begins to divide by mitosis The forming embryo contains genetically identical cells. However they become different from each other by expressing different genes. The cells specialize, migrate and a complex multicellular organism is formed. Each child is genetically different because they developed from genetically different eggs and genetically different sperm. (identical twins are an exception you will learn about later.)

Living things are… Highly Organized!! What is the significance of the DNA molecule in terms of ORGANIZATION? The DNA molecule is highly organized AND provides the “blueprint” for the organization of living things. If this beaker contained the exact proportion of elements (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.) that are typically present in living things, could you “create life” by simply stirring the mixture? Why NO? NO! ORGANIZATION is missing. What is the smallest organizational unit of living things? The Cell For life to occur, the atoms much be organized into specific molecules and ultimately organized into CELLS! For life to occur, the atoms much be organized into specific molecules and ultimately organized into CELLS! Glacier National Park Montana USA Copyright 2010, Sue Bard, Mary Alice Jost, Howard Community College Living Things are Diverse, But All Living Organisms: Metabolize… What characteristic of living things is illustrated in these photos? METABOLIZE Living Things… Living things carry out metabolism – this refers to all the chemical reactions that occur in a cell – both break down and build up reactions. Through metabolism, organisms obtain molecular building blocks, convert energy, and break down waste. Without metabolism there is not life! Plants and Animals differ in their metabolism in terms of their source of energy and carbon. To survive, ALL living organisms require 1) carbon from which to build organic molecules, and 2) a source of energy. Plants produce organic molecules using carbon from carbon dioxide. Because plants produce their own organic molecules and don’t eat other organisms to obtain organic molecules, they are referred to as: heterotrophs or autotrophs? Autotrophs ! (self-nourishing) Animals eat organic molecules which provides a source of carbon, as well as a source of energy. Because animals “eat others” they are referred to as: heterotrophs or autotrophs? Heterotrophs ! (nourished off of others) How do plants and animals differ in terms of their source of energy? Plants can convert light energy to useful chemical energy. Animals break down organic molecules as a source of energy. Glacier National Park Montana USA Copyright 2010, Sue Bard, Mary Alice Jost, Howard Community College Living Things are Diverse, But All Living Organisms: Respond to Stimuli… What characteristic of living things is illustrated in these photos? OUCH! Here comes a fly! The fly presses on hairs (trichomes) in the leaves. The leaves close and “trap” the fly. Respond to Stimuli Living Things… Living things sense and react to (respond to) factors in the environment (stimuli). This greatly enhances the survival of organisms. How are these responses beneficial? Attraction to the smell of fish helps the cat find food. Closing of the trap assists the plant in digesting the fly and obtaining needed minerals. An automatic response (reflex) results in moving the arm and bringing the hand away from the sense of pain. This reduces the chance of damage to the hand. Can you think of other ways in which organisms respond to stimuli? And how are the responses beneficial? How does evolution relate to this?

Glacier National Park Montana USA Copyright 2010, Sue Bard, Mary Alice Jost, Howard Community College Living Things are Diverse, But All Living Organisms: Maintain Homeostasis… What characteristic of living things is illustrated in these photos? John became over-heated after his run, and now he is perspiring The body temperature of this crocodile had become too cold for food digestion, so now it is “sun bathing” Humans maintain the pH of their blood at about 7.4 by using chemical buffers that react with acids and bases. Living Things maintain… Homeostasis Homeostasis means “to stay the same” – in this case to regulate and maintain such factors as body temperature, chemical composition, and cellular structure. Is the maintenance of homeostasis “easy”? Is it important? Maintenance of homeostasis in living things costs energy – it is a very active process. And it involves complex regulation. Life is not possible without homeostasis. Glacier National Park Montana USA Copyright 2010, Sue Bard, Mary Alice Jost, Howard Community College Living Things are Diverse, But All Living Organisms: Evolve… What characteristic of living things is illustrated in these photos? (The images show some of the results of a process that takes place over time) The thorns on this tree protect the bark from being eaten by animals. The elephant is protected by its thick skin. (Pachyderm means “thick skin”!) The pointed beak of the Pileated Woodpecker allows it to eat insects off the bark of trees. The growth of plants toward a source of light ensures they will have sufficient light for photosynthesis. The green, photosynthetic bark of the Palo Verde tree that grows in Arizona allows it to lose leaves to conserve water, but still continue to photosynthesize. The gills of a fish enable it to breathe in water. The long neck of giraffes enables them to reach vegetation in trees. Male giraffes compete for females by fighting with their necks. The longer-neck giraffes seem to “impress” the females! Another advantage??? But there is a “down side” to having long necks, that makes giraffes vulnerable to attack. You just saw many “adaptations” – physical and behavioral characteristics that favor the survival of organisms. Scientists explain that adaptations come about through the process of evolution. The change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals. (a simplified definition) EVOLUTION IS… HUH??? The change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals. Individuals in a population vary in their genetic makeup largely due to mutations (random changes in DNA) and sexual recombination of genes The change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural (or artificial) selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals. Depending on the conditions, some genes will enable organisms to better survive and reproduce. This is natural selection. Evolution also occurs by “artificial” selection as when humans select and breed dogs with specific characteristics. The change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural (or artificial) selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals. Evolution takes place over time, and involves genetic changes in populations. You may discuss this further in class, or through assigned readings.

Food All living things need food to get energy to carry out all the activities. Plants make their own food in the presence of water, sunlight and soil. Animals and human beings depend on plants for food. Non-living things do not need food for their survival. 2. Growth All living things follow a life cycle in which they are born, grow and finally die. A seed grows into a seedling, then into a plant and finally into a tree. A baby grows into an adult and finally becomes old. Animals also grow from babies to adults. As the living beings grow, they change in size, shape and appearance. Non-living things do not grow and they remain the same. 3. Movement All living things move from one place to another. Animals move in search of food. Some animals hunt for their food while others graze on grass. Birds fly in the air. Human beings roam for different activities. Plants though living do not move from place to place. They are help in the soil by their roots. Some parts of certain plants can move some of their plants like the leaves of certain plants close at night and open in the night and the branches of a sunflower always bend in the direction of sunlight. We need to push or pull to move a non-living thing. Non-living things cannot move on their own. 4. Breathe All living things need also to breathe and stay alive. All living things have an organ which helps in breathing. Human beings and many animals breathe through nose. Insects have tiny air holes in their body called as spiracles. Fish breathe though gills. Plants breathe through openings, called stomata, on their leaves. As non-living things do not have life, they do not breathe. 5. Reproduction All living things produce more of it’s kind with the process of reproductions. Some animals lay eggs while others including human beings give birth to young ones. Plants produce seeds. Non-living things do no reproduce. 6. Response Living things have sense organs (eyes, nose, tongue, skin and ears) due to which they respond to changes in their environment. Animals also feel and respond to changes in their environment. Bears hibernate in winters to protect itself from cold. Dogs have sharp sense of smell. Plants do not grow in the absence of light, water and air. Non-living things do not feel. They are not affected by any changes around them.
