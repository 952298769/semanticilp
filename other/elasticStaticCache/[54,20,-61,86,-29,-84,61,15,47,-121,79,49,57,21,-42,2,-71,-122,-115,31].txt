The bottom line in evolution is reproductive success reproductive success: how many reproductive-age offspring an individual produces in its lifetime a mother who has three viable offspring in her lifetime has a reproductive success of 3 or, in relative terms, she has greater reproductive success than a mother who only has 2 offspring in her lifetime any trait that increases reproductive success becomes more common in the next generation obviously, an individual has to survive long enough to reproduce so the ability to survive long enough to have offspring strongly affects reproductive success hence the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" but reproductive success is also strongly affected by how effective individuals are at mating and making sure their offspring live to healthy adulthood just surviving does not get your traits into the next generation the only way for your traits to continue into future generations is to have offspring that survive to breeding age themselves the more offspring, the more common your traits will be in subsequent generations so, \"survival of the fittest\" only covers part of the process a more complete description might be \"proliferation of the traits of the most fruitful\" there is no moral judgement here I am NOT saying that any animals (or humans) \"should\" produce lots of offspring only that the traits of those that do will become more common the traits that lead to having many offspring might or might not be \"good\" for the individual or the group but they will become more common, regardless there is nothing here about what the species \"needs\", \"improvements\", etc. just an automatic process in which the traits that are passed on the most, become the most common Point: the way animals select their mates and care for their offspring must be something on which natural selection acts that is, selection must strongly favor behaviors that result in more offspring being produced that is, anything that positively affects mating and caring for the infants until they can survive on their own you might play a mental game while studying evolutionary explanations of primate behavior consider how you might apply these ideas to human behavior many are quite applicable but beware: humans are a more complex case some of our behavior is obviously strongly influenced by heredity for example, most individuals seek sex most females care for their children these behaviors are so universal, and so obviously related to reproductive success, that they are presumably at least partially the products of natural selection but more than any other animal, our behavior is also influenced by learning including the values and practices of culture and learned behavior is not inherited the learned behavior of offspring may be quite different from that of their parents offspring's behavior may tend to resemble their parents' but in some circumstances there may be no correlation or the offspring may even tend to be different from their parents also, individuals may acquire behavioral tendencies from others who are not their biological parents friends, celebrities, teachers, etc. the point: one of Darwin's postulates does not apply to at least some aspects of behavior in animals like us that acquire a lot of their behavior through learning many behavioral traits are not inherited so the whole evolutionary process as Darwin modeled it is not directly applicable to learned behaviors so learned behavior, including culture, is not subject to the same kind of evolution as are inherited traits so we have to be very careful about applying evolutionary explanations to human behavior evolutionary explanations are applicable to those behavioral tendencies that are heritable but they are not applicable to behavioral tendencies that are not heritable unfortunately, telling which behaviors are or are not partially heritable is extremely difficult in creatures with behavior as complex as ours what is a \"mating system\"?",1.450740098953247],["What is the phenotypic ratio of the offspring from the mating of 2 parents heterozygous for both traits.",1.3911006450653076],["List

mates without any preference for one phenotype or another that is, a person with type A blood is just as likely to mate with a person with type B blood as with a person with any other type of blood random mating is obviously a reasonable assumption for mate choice in plants pollen blowing on the wind is not picky about where it lands it is also a reasonable assumption for animals, even humans although animals might be picky about one or a few traits, they cannot possibly be picky about many of them, or they would never find mates besides, many traits like blood type, tooth morphology, etc. are invisible, and so could not have any influence on mate choice so random mating with respect to a given trait is generally a reasonable claim if mating is random, then the offspring get all the possible combinations of alleles, in proportions that are determined by the frequencies of the alleles among the parents, and by nothing else that is, if you know the relative proportions of all the alleles in a population, you can tell what the proportions of all the genotypes will be A brief example \"Hitchhiker's thumb\" (\"double-jointed thumb\") = the condition of being able to bend the
