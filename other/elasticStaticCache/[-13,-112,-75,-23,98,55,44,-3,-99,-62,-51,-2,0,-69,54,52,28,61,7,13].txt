[["Toronto Rocks page 8) Sedimentary Rocks Importance of Sedimentary Rocks common (cover about 75% land surface ) source of fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) source groundwater (more on this in final lecture) most mines are located in sedimentary rocks history of life found as fossils in sedimentary rocks layered rocks on Mars suggest a sedimentary origin indicates that liquid water may have existed on the planet's surface Detrital (also known as clastic) sedimentary rocks consist of pieces of pre-existing rocks for example sandstone Chemical Sedimentary Rocks consist of chemicals from pre-existing rocks for example rock salt Processes involved in making Sedimentary Rocks Weathering Mechanical = smaller pieces produced Chemical = new minerals produced, chemicals released Transportation moves sediment and chemicals Deposition -Depositional environments = place where sediments and chemicals accumulate Mechanical Weathering Fig 5.5 p 95 frost wedging water pressure can force rock apart, particularly along coastlines Fig 5.9 p. 97 organic activity attrition (wearing away by friction) occurs between particles during transportation Fig 5.8 p. 96 pressure release salt crystal growth Chemical Weathering Chemical decomposition of minerals For example iron in mafic minerals rusts(or oxidizes) Accelerated in hot humid climates water promotes movement of chemicals and can participate in chemical reactions chemical weathering is accelerated in warm, moist conditions Table 5.1 p. 99 High temperature minerals in Bowen's reaction series are more suseptible to chemical weathering Mechanical and Chemical Weathering Cooperate with one another Fig 5.11 p. 99 mechanical weathering increases surface area for a given volume surface area is more suseptible to chemical weathering chemical weathering softens \nmaterial and makes it more prone to mechanical weathering Transportation by water, wind or ice Fig 5.19 method and length of transportation reflected in the shape of particles method of transportation reflected in sorting by size Environment of Deposition Fig 5.20, p. 107 Characterized by temperature, water depth and salinity etc. Examples, Desert Dunes (continental), Beach (transitional), Coral reef (marine) Use clues found in rocks such as rock type, sedimentary structures(bedding, Fig 5.27, p.113 cross-bedding, ripple marks, mud cracks, gutter casts), fossils Submarine Fans as an example Fig 5.28 sediment carried far out to sea by turbidity currents graded bedding is sedimentary structure Lithification turns loose sediment such as sand grains into rock such as sandstone compaction (particles brought together by weight of overlying sediment) cementation (particles glued together by chemically precipitated minerals including quartz, calcite and hematite) Classification see Table 5.3 p 108 Detrital rocks names based on particle size for example, rocks made of sand-sized particles are called sandstones chemical sedimentary rocks named for the dominate mineral that they contain for example, rocks made up of the mineral calcite are called limestones limestones are the most common chemical sedimentary rocks, most contain calcite skeletons of organisms such as coral Sedimentary Rocks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) ( Toronto Rocks p 3-4, 10-11) Layer II is the bedrock which consists of limestones interlayered with shales the fossils found in these rocks show that their depositional environment was a warm, shallow sea Layer III consists of geologically young Quaternary sediments deposited by glaciers or in glacially-influenced lakes these sediments have not been cemented into rocks The Niagara Escarpment forms a ridge along the western boundary of the GTA It reveals bedrock (the solid rock beneath soil and loose material) Consists of shale and sandstone capped by a resistent cliff-forming layer of dolostone (a rock related to limestone) Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are changed from sedimentary and igneous rocks by the following agents: heat from magma or from being forced into the hotter depths of Earth by subduction pressure from the weight of overlying rocks or compression ultimately related to tectonic plates fluid activity may be the addition of fluids such as hot water solutions (for example asbestos forms this way) may be the loss of fluids such as water that is driven off when clay minerals are heated Types of Metamorphism Fig 6.19, p. 139 regional occurs when rocks are deformed by combinations of high temperatures and/or high pressures especially important at convergent plate margins Fig 6.5, p. 130 contact occurs when magma alters the rock it intrudes Fig 6.7, p. 131 dynamic occurs when rock ground up with movement along a fault Shock metamorphism due to impact of meteorites can create diamonds Classification of Metamorphic Rocks Table 6.2, p. 133 broadly divided into those rocks that have a foliation and those that are not foliated Foliation a parallel arrangement of elongated minerals for example platy minerals such as micas Fig 6.9, p.134 produced when minerals become oriented due to differential pressure Foliated Metamorphic Rocks named on the basis of the size of the minerals grains and their shape or granularity slate consists of microscopic mineral grains its foliation causes it to split into flat layers that can be used for billiard and pool table tops Fig 6.10, p. 134 gneiss (pronounced \"nice\") consists mainly of granular minerals its foliation is seen in alternating bands of of felsic (light) and mafic (dark) minerals Fig 6.12, p.135 Nonfoliated Metamorphic Rocks contain granular rather than platy minerals that have increased in size through recrystallization Fig 6.15, p. 137 and 6.14, p. 136 marble forms by contact or regional metamorphism of limestone Metamorphic Rocks are found in the Canadian Shield that underlies Toronto ancient Precambrian marble and gneiss make up Layer I or the \"basement rock\" of the Toronto region Back to List of Lectures",1.2174807786941528],["Most of the subbasin contains clay soil formed from noncarbonate sedimentary rocks.",1.2156766653060913],["Because most of
