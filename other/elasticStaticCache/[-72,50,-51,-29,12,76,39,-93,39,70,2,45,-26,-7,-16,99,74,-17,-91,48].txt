Homozygous If an individual has two of the same alleles at a particular locus, he is said to be homozygous ( \nor is a homozygote) A person is homozygous if he inherits a Hemoglobin S allele from both his mother and father Genotype: HbS/ HbS Phenotype: Sickle Cell Anemia Heterozygous If an individual has two different alleles at a particular locus, he is said to be heterozygous (or is a heterozygote) A person is heterozygous if he inherits a Hemoglobin S allele from his mother and a Hemoglobin A allele from his father Genotype: HbS/ HbA Phenotype: Sickle Cell Trait (Carrier) Dominant and Recessive Alleles are said to be dominant or recessive depending upon whether they are expressed (dominant) or hidden (recessive) in heterozygotes In the ABO system, A and B alleles are dominant over O, and co-dominant with each other (Blood type AB) O is recessive to both A and B Gregor Mendel Augustinian Monk Determined that the nature of inheritance was particulate (genes) Published findings in 1865 Was unknown until 1900 Mendelian Genetics An individual can have two different types of genes for a particular characteristic and only express one type Example: ABO blood type system, if you have both an A type gene and an O type gene, your blood type is A, and your blood functions as blood type A Mendelian Genetics Law of Segregation Genes occur in pairs (because chromosomes occur in pairs, one from the mother and one from the father) During meiosis, chromosome pairs separate so that each gamete contains one member of each pair Each gamete has an equal (50-50) chance of containing a particular maternal or paternal chromosome (randomness) Mendelian Genetics Law of Independent Assortment Alleles that govern one trait sort into gametes independently of the alleles for other traits--providing they are on separate chromosomes Chance governs which pairs of alleles from loci on separate chromosomes are found in any given gamete Independent Assortment The ABO locus is
