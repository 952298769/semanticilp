[28]   [29] The beaver is an environmental engineer -- second only to man in its ability to change the landscape for its own needs. [30] Beavers alter their environment on a large scale in order to provide themselves with shelter and protection. [31] However, this can often be a recipe for conflict with humans. Beavers flood roads, cut down trees, plug road culverts, and can even cause dangerous flash flooding when one of their dams break. [32] However, their dam building activity has a very beneficial side. Beavers build and economically maintain wetlands that soak up floodwaters from upstream, prevent erosion, raise the water table, and create an ecosystem that breaks down toxins and pesticides, purifying the water. [33] Beavers prefer to dam streams in shallow valleys, by cutting down small trees and clearing brush. Much of the flooded area will become wetlands. Insects lay eggs in wetland environments. Fish, ducks, frogs, turtles and birds feed on the insects and larvae, and other animals in turn feed on them. [34] The biodiversity of a wetland can rival a tropical rain forest. As many as half of the endangered species in North America rely upon wetlands. [35]   [36] These marshy wetland areas also selectively allow certain trees to grow, that in turn, support different species of wildlife that require riparian (relating to the banks of a natural course of water) environments. [37] Other mammals, such as otters, will feed on the fish, and birds like ospreys, will nest in the dead trees that are killed by the flooding of the beaver pond. [38] In time, sediment will fill in the pond behind the dam and become a meadow. Shrubs will begin to grow and provide shade for tree seedlings. When the tree seedlings get tall enough, they will shade out the shrubs and eventually turn into a mature forest. Beavers help to begin this natural cycle, which is called forest succession, by building their dams.
