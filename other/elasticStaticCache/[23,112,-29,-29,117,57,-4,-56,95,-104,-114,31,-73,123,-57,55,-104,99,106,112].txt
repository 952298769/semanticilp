Most animals that live in the arctic snow are white. Being white helps them blend in with the snow and hide from predators. An example of a physiological adaptation that increases the likelihood of survival is the kangaroo rat's metabolism. Kangaroo rats live in the desert of the North American Southwest. It is extremely hot and dry there, and very little water is available. The kangaroo rat never needs to drink water because its metabolism has changed and adapted to conserve water; it gets all the water it needs from seeds it eats. Humans are the opposite; we must drink water daily because our metabolism uses lots of water. An example of a behavioral adaptation that increases reproduction is the croaking and calling of male frogs, which gets female frogs to come to the males for mating. Those frogs that call end up mating with more females and have more offspring than frogs that do not call.",1.9631702899932861],["This activity demonstrates an important part of evolution: adaptation. Adaptation is \"an alteration or adjustment in structure or habits, often hereditary, by which a species or individual improves its condition in relationship to its environment.\" [1] In order to survive in an environment, an animal needs to adapt, to develop traits that fit it to where it lives. For example, mountain goats have padded hooves to grip the rocks on which they climb, giraffes are tall to reach the leaves of tall trees, and frogs have long, sticky tongues to catch insects to eat, and are colored brown or green to match their environments so that predators do not notice them. In fact, nearly everything about an animal is an adaptation of one kind or another.
