william - wet & cold from crying - hard & old from bitterness & dying & dog tired of living, like william s mongrels Camp Dog the life losing drag of gorged ticks as i pluck them off with tweezers/ grape shaped bodies buried in the skin of camp dog/ alot of blood for a little dog & a bloody stump for an anus/ they found me weeping/ pieces of tick & dog stuck to my wrists/ & dust thick blood wiped from my tearducts/ it was no suprise when my father said: e s no good/ yar betta orf puttin im down/ camp dog s toenails rip my dress/ local koories walk by the royal with the other camp dogs/ & my father says: hundreds of em at the tip/ abos dogs/ shoot em if i get the chance/ the bone of the town is turned on me/ the outback darling breathes green algae/ & the fleecy white corpse of humanity turns slowly in it/ the streets of bourke are ribs from a body that walks without dreaming/ i hear about its feral children who smash the windows/ who jump the fences to steal the vegetables/ i hear 5600 dogs in a town of 2300/ the long low howl of a brewarrina sunset which makes my skin crawl/ & twilight fights in a town overstocked with dogs/ bloated dogs to be shot as food for other dogs/ mangey tip scavengers with no vet/ i am left kneeling in the street/ facing a sky empty with the risk of sunstroke/ ticks turning in dirt/ & bulbous sacks of blood to be disregarded or popped/ i haven t the energy to burst things open/ like pods or eggs or blisters/ or the balloon shaped bodies of ticks/ i grow tired of cancerous towns & cities bleeding the dust to death/ my eyes sting from sleepy moistness or from tears/ with too much red from fingertip to forearm/ i cannot wipe it away with the rage, the rag that twists \nmoisture from its ends like a worn out washer/ when camp dog s

vanish above & below its tracks of dry waves as though it were flowing/ past the flaky grey bases of gums & old ten gallon drum bins toppling over with drumstick wrappers/ the calm gradient of city parkland carries their bellies along to the creek s hidden edges/ i want my dogs to experience many landscapes/ as dusk nuzzles up to my ankles & to my dogs noses turning damp & cold fogging up the camera lenses/ they will swallow or be swallowed by foreground objects like barbecues or boulders/ they will fade out over the round cupped edges of hills into clouds that sink behind themselves/ & appear like black specks on the watery grey endings of dirty rainbows/ or disappear completely before emerging again from forest darkrooms/ my dogs will be unleashed so that they may contain the landscapes inside themselves/ in australia shadows of blue heelers, red kelpies & photographers ignite along its huge crust & vanish in an instant/ leaving behind projected movement & dust-filled film equipment/ & they may have left a passing footprint in the sand/ & they may have left a story for the rock Diesel on the road from carins to normanton we picked up a dog/ a couple of travellers told us to go back down to charters towers/ & to take the one-lane highway across to mount isa/ there had been rain/ but we chose to risk the section of unsealed road along the bottom end of the cape york penninsula/ to view the queensland peppermint & river red gum landscape/ & its constant expansion into kilometres of giant plateaus & underground lava tunnels from extinct volcanoes/ we chose to widen our knowledge of roadside brolgas & dumped dogs like hitchhikers waiting for a lift/ after light rain the normanton road had expanded out into side lanes/ into large bottomless pits deep & soft with mud/ new bitumen strips stood high & dry in the middle/ with access to them blocked by roadwork signs/ a couple of tourists from holland took the detours & ended up bogged up to the windows/ their white arms waving from cars with mud pouring in/ 8888888888888888888888 on another lonely stretch a man was trying to gas himself inside his old bomb car with his german shepherd/ the dog s horrible barking brought us to a halt/ i got out to see what was the matter/ & his car door flew open & he took off into the bush with his german shepherd following him/ the dog s hysteria being released like exhaust fumes into the stunted growth/ on a very muddy section on which the e.h. holden was skating/ we came across a muscular black dog sitting on the side of the road/ it watched us pass noticing our dogs in the back/ we slowed down without stopping & i pushed my door open with my foot/ i called out: come on come on/ & the big black dog slid through mud/ it jumped onto my lap/ its wagging tail slapping my chest & face/ the bright orange clay flicking up onto the vinyl ceiling & interior light/ 8888888888888888 adrian said: perhaps we should go onto some properties & try to look for the owner/ i said: no/ as harshly as if i had slammed my foot onto the brakes/ there were hundreds of properties out there hidden in the scrub/ amongst drowned coolibah trees & sharp topaz jutting out/ i suggested we stick to the road & drive straight to croydon/ when we got into town we filled the tank with petrol/ then i went to the local shire building & the town clerk tied the dog up to the flagpole/ then a carload of locals drove past/ two wheels of the mud splashed ute jumping up over the gutter/ ripping into the sprinkler greened lawn/ the full round spotlight dangling crazily from the roof & the wire caged section on the back mingling with lunatic dogs/ in the front were thin-lipped australians with deep squinting eyes, checked shirts & dusty hats/ the chain rattled on the flagpole as the dog began to gyrate/ diesel, one cried out/ so that the dog stood to attention & became darker/ then he hopped out of the ute & came up & shook my hand/ the others observing me through the window glass/ i could tell he would be the type to keep his distance under normal circumstances/ but he offered me reward money/ i didn t want any/ i saw diesel washed clean by a brief shower & enthusiastic stroking from her owner/ then her black shining loaded into the back with the other dogs/ he said that she had been missing for two days/ & that they were heading back out into the scrub/ these men are pig killers, i thought/ & compared my dogs lives to theirs/ i was pleased to have found their thick- jawed dog/ but i thought of the dead black pigs torn at the throat/ out there behind the bloodwood & paperbarks in the queensland scrub/ tusks turned upwards drinking in rain/ dried blood & the long lashed eyes half-buried in mud On the Back of the Ute panorama and dog saliva, we are leaving the property behind, to reflect upon itself in the grey flood water, we are heading into town, to do some simple shopping and have a quiet drink, i m watching the world go by, the winter sun filtering down, roughed -up and wind-blown, on the back of the ute, splinters of rock press up through the soil, kangaroos decide to hop away, as the dogs and i take in the stream \nof bush, we are blind to details, continually letting go, over every second of road, we are life-sized, our heads in the sky, the shreded exhaust and retreads roaring, bumps and potholes, patches of bulldust, the vibration of corrugation, an 80km per hour wind to howl and rattle collars, the high sun to heat my arm against metal, and a hat pushed on with my other hand, in case the big gale lifts it sideways, washaways, causeways, cattle grids, floodways, long orange trails leading inland and twisty dirt roads to stick to, each side moves in blurs to a triangle, to the centre of the back of the ute, my hair stuck to my cheeks, across my lips as it moves to its triangular point, skyline river gums closing in behind us, gravel stones smashing up against the diff, we are affected by the surface, by what we skim along, we re air-born, throwing up dust, beers are handed back from the driver, the rough ride and shouting giving us presence, the dogs put down their tongues and pant, tails steering their clumsy excitement, in motion from one side to the other, over the spare tyre and a greasy rope, holding fast to the paintwork, so as not to be left behind, which is important, as every property dog knows, when we go into town, to buy the newspaper and put on lotto, then if one should fall, well, i can t get a grip on any of them, in this way we are here to be ourselves, on the old green canvas and a backpack, in the back of the ute, bumping along the queensland border near collerina, we define boundaries by what we cross and choose to see, the bitumen or the tricky dust, an early star, a paper daisy, a gutted rusted holden bomb, fencelines and telstra wire, galahs lifting into the sky, 1000 galahs, now pink now grey, they are free to change direction, our winds from wing and tarp collide, we both lift up, combine and separate, moving ute and native birds, foraging for sustenance out back.",0.6497552394866943],["When cats drink it is relatively silent, while a dog must
