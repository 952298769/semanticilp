At last a website about dogs and dog training that makes sense and cuts out the rubbish being sold by so many dog training sites and trainers. A site that sees it from the dog's perspective (thereby respecting dogs for the magnificent animals they are). I have been a professional dog (person) trainer now in England for 4.5 years since I retired from a life career in the British police service. I consider my real job is to assist people to train their dogs rather than me training their dogs for them. My biggest challenge so far is trying to explain and to convince dog owners that their dogs are animals to be respected as such rather than people (children) dressed in a fur coat. My experience is the reason it is so difficult to get most people to understand things differently is that that's what they are actually looking for... a person (child) in a fur coat. It seems they go and get a puppy very often to fill a part in their lives that has actually existed before but is now missing (the child that has now grown up and has flown the nest, the life long partner who has passed on, the human brood that has not been created yet). I find many younger couples go and buy a puppy then try to treat it as a baby person. It's almost as though they think they can practice for the real thing. When one tries to explain a dog is not a replacement person the response is so often disbelief, sadness, bewilderment and on occasions right down anger at someone saying it!

A single gene is a group of instructions of an indeterminate length, and somewhere within all those instructions is the code which will determine whether or not the cat is white or non-white. Since a cat receives two sets of instructions (one from each parent), how is it determined what will happen? Each gene has at least one and sometimes more \"alleles\" which will determine the overall effect. It is the \"allele\" which determines whether a trait is dominant or recessive. In the case of the white cat, the \"make the fur white\" allele, \"W\" is dominant, while the \"make the fur non-white\" allele, \"w\", is recessive. As a result, the fur of this particular cat may be white or non-white only. To further illustrate this, a cat has two and only two white genes. Since each white gene (for purposes of example) consists of one of two alleles, \"W\" or \"w\", a cat may have one of four possible genetic codes (called karyotypes) for white: \"WW\", \"Ww\", \"wW\", and \"ww\". Since \"W\" is dominant to \"w\", any code containing \"W\" (\"WW\", \"Ww\", \"wW\") willl produce white cats, while \"ww\" will always produce a non-white cat.",1.093132734298706],["One example of this is the trait of the White Forelock.",1.0882254838943481],["The AKC recognizes more than 120 breeds of purebred dogs, each with specific physical and behavioral traits.
