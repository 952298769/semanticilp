Early agriculturalists scattered seeds on ground that had been prepared, most likely by burning or some other disruption of the soil surface. Those seeds that passed their genes onto the next generation (natural selection) were those that best competed with weeds. Selection pressure due to weed competition results in a number of changes, including the reduction or elimination of seed dormancy and larger seeds ( Harlan and others 1973 ; Smith 1998 ). Dormancy is very undesirable in annual crops, and most domesticated species germinate rapidly upon planting. Selection against dormancy has been so extreme, however, that under certain weather conditions, seeds of modern wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) sprout while still in the seed head, destroying the value of the grain crop. Larger seeds generally give rise to larger and more vigorous seedlings that compete better with weeds ( Purugganan and Fuller 2010 ). In the grasses, selection for larger seed size is associated with increased starch and decreased protein in the endosperm. For example, the protein content of teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis)—the wild ancestor of maize (Zea mays mays), which is referred to as corn in North America—is approximately 30%, while the protein content of modern maize is 11% ( Flint-Garcia and others 2009 ).",0.9140164852142334],["Much of God's Seed was being scattered by \"Winds of Adversity\" allowed by Him to send this seed places to be
