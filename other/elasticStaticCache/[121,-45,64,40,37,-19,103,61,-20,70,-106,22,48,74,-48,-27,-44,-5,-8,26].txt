of metabolic waste products: feces, urine, CO2 * acquisition and disposal ultimately occurs at cellular level - cells uptake of dispose of materials - occur within aqueous environment - movement of substances into and out of cells involves crossing cell membranes * chemical exchanges are fairly simple matter for single-celled organisms: diffusion * most multicellular organisms are too large for materials to be exchanged strictly by diffusion - elaborate systems have evolved to acquire and dispose of substances - one system deals with exchange of gases (O2 &amp; CO2) between animal and their environment * gas exchange often/usually involves circulatory system Circulatory Systems * general functions of circulatory system - tranport of fluids throughout body - gas exchange (in many but not all organisms) - nutrients - waste products - hormonal regulation * gastrovascular cavity - unspecialized body plan - found in Platyhelminthes (flatworms), cnidarians - serves dual functions:
