proportion -of plants to buildings (use size of plants \nat maturity) Identifying suitable plants Visit nurseries, established horticultural gardens, drive through nice neighborhoods Consult a landscape plant text Designing the public area The driveway shape, choice of paving material Planting beds Trees form the backbone of the landscape Work around previously existing trees Placement of trees on an empty lot is extremely important Evergreen trees for year-around screens (wind, privacy, street lights, etc.) Don t plant large trees close to the house Foundation plantings shrubs planted in beds along the front of the house Corner plantings to soften the sharp angles of construction Line plantings delineate property lines Guidelines for planting beds in the public area Use of edging materials Plant shrubs in masses of the same species Mulch, groundcover in between plants Large beds with curved lines are generally more attractive than small, angled beds Use only a few species of plants Avoid lawn ornaments Designing the private living area Most desire: deck/patio, privacy (screening, wind, noise), shade Patios and decks Note orientation to the sun s movement Consider cost of construction, maintenance (including replacement) Privacy Fences An appropriate fence minimizes noise better than plants Planting beds Raised beds Tall hedges (evergreens for year-around privacy) Plants minimize wind better than fences Use plants in front of fence to conceal fence (vines), more natural look Shade Determine where (on house/yard/patio), when (afternoon/seasons) you desire shade Use shade trees consider mature height Dense shade trees (large leaves, round branching form) Maple, oak, sycamore Dense shade impacts other plants you can grow Lawns, full, partial sun requiring shrubs Light shade trees (small leaves, open branching form) Filtered shade Birch, honey locust Deciduous trees useful on south side of house summer cooling/winter warming Consider focal points, attractive views in design of planting beds in private area Designing the service/utility area Primary goal is screening Use fencing, hedges of shrubs, or both Vegetable garden requires full sun

plants Consider pests and disease Exotic plants may give you problems Maintenance requirements Consider height at maturity and growth rate Hardwoods for shade take a long time Fast growing trees may
