Stone Caryatid Who Has Fallen Under Her Stone I look tenderly at her face as she lies there crushed by her load that she is still trying so hard to lift The look upon her face tells me she is still trying so hard to stand and show the world of this, her gift When first I heard of this it was such a wonder to me that the sculpture was so brave to carve such a piece To show that he understood not only the esthetics of the building structures was wrong but to show a little peace He looked deep within the heart of woman and knew that she had something that can be seen daily throughout the land A depth of feeling that she has given to all of us down through time shows in her face as she continues to try to raise her hands How could the architects of old not understand that holding up a building was not what a young girl was meant to carry this load Didn't they realize that a young girl did not have the strength to hold up buildings that they are much to heavy for their shoulders to hold I look into his heart and see that he has portrayed all the women who throughout time have been crushed by too heavy a burden to bear Crushed by something they were unable to control perhaps and buried down under their burden but still trying, never showing dispair The mother who still goes to the field to bring in the food to her children who is doubled up with the pain that fills her inside The woman who keeps bravely going on no matter what so that she may provide food for her children as she fights hard against the tide Dispair can come so easily but so many have braved so much and still after taken so much load still try their best to lift it up high Waiting desperately for some help perhaps and I see that she knows it will not be coming so she just bears her load and does try So as I look at this young girl who has been crushed and a tear rolls slowly down my face as I reach out to her with my heart I see that perhaps although I can not help her there are others out there who I want to help and this poem is just a start If you have such a burden that crushes you and brings you crashing down to your knees that you can not lift it any more Remember there are those of us out here who are willing to help you if you would just ask and that is what friendship is for I reach out my hand to you to show you that burden that you carry may be lightened just a bit somehow if you let me help you to shoulder the load Both of us together sharing it might make it a bearable thing so that it will not crush you and together we share the burden as we go down life's road Even if you have no \none to turn to then remember there are people like me who see your burden and understand that their is nothing that you can do As the load crushes you and you reach out with no response think of us out here who are willing but unable to find you to help you through So now I understand what he was showing by this sculpture that at first glace seems so very cruel and heartless if you take it at first glance It reaches deep within my heart and I understand what he was showing and it fills me with a sense of wonder as I know it will give me another chance To share myself with this reader who knows of their load that is crushing them and burying them under its weight and pushing them down So I offer to be a friend who will help them in their hour of need and I ask you to help me
