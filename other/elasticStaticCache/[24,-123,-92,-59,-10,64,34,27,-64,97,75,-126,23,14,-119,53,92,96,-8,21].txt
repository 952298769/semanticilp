stimulates production and release of gametes from the gonads (FSH and LH are gonadotropins) thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) - stimulates the release of hormones from the thyroid gland growth hormone (GH) - stimulate growth in all tissues adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) - stimulate the adrenal glands to release hormones thyroid gland hormones produced functions thyroxine and triiodothryronine hormone function these hormones require iodine for their function they act on many different tissues to control our body's metabolism parathyroid gland hormones parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and vitamin D (colicalciferol) function controls calcium (Ca) metabolism is involved in controling bone growth adrenal gland adrenal cortex - the outer region of the adrenal gland hormones produced glucocorticoids -- examples: cortisol and cortisosterone mineralocorticoids -- example: aldosterone functions cortisol - glucose synthesis from other food sources like amino acids and lipid corticosterone - promotes inflammatory responses as a result of injury aldosterone and other mineralocorticoids - regulate the electrolyte balance of the body by the kidney adrenal medulla - center region of the adrenal gland hormones produced epinephrine ( adrenaline) norepinephrine function as with the sympathetic nervous system, these substances cause activation of the flight or fight responses increases metabolic rates islet cells in the pancreas (islets of Langerhans) hormones insulin - from beta cells ( b -cells) glucagon - from alpha cells ( a -cells) function insulin causes the storage of excess blood glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver and muscle cells glucagon causes the release of glucose from glycogen stores Gonads Testis hormone - testosterone function - acts to cause male secondary sex characteristics (deepening of voice, hair growth patterns, muscle growth/fat deposition etc..)",1.7610450983047485]]
