Each microcosm was equipped with a ring of transparent vitrification foil of 20 cm height to prevent the escape of soil animals. Soil was taken from an old fallow grassland site (Lahnberge near Marburg, Hesse, Germany; 50°48′N, 8°48′E, 325 m above sea level) and, prior to use, was defaunated by freezing at −25°C for 7 days.

Mark plants A, B and C. 2. Put cardboard pieces at the bottom of each bag. 3. Put plant A in one bag with one 250mL beaker half filled with water. Place Alka- Seltzer in water, twist close. 4. Put plant B in one bag. Put 50mL of Soda Lime in a Petri dish and place in bag with plant B, twist close. 5. Put plant C in one bag. Twist close. (This is the \"control\" plant.) 6. Find a sunny place in your classroom to place all three plants. (The plants must have same amount of sunlight and water.) The plants are to set for one day. 7. After one day, remove plants from bags. Break off one leaf from each plant put in Petri dishes marked A, B, and C. 8. Half fill the 500mL beaker with water. 9. Fill the 250mL beaker with alcohol. 10. Place beaker with alcohol into beaker with water, on to the hot plate. 11. Take leaves one at a time and put in beaker with hot alcohol. Leave in for ten minutes. 12. Remove leaf with plastic tongues. 13. Place leaf on paper towel to dry, then place in Petri dish. 14. Place several drops of potassium iodide on each leaf. 15.
