Prevention of egg desiccation critical to leaving aquatic environment completely alteration in development to form special membranes around the developing embryo these membranes are called the amnion, chorion and allantois reptile, bird and mammal embryos form these membranes during embryogenesis these animals are collectively known as amniotes anatomical characteristics allowing division of the amniotes (especially important for paleontology) anatomical structures of the skull allow us to identify three early offshoots from the first amniotic animals anapsids skull has only a depression for the eye socket synapsids skull has a single depression in addition to the eye socket posterior to eye diapsids two additional cavities in the skull posterior and dorsally to eye socket reptiles are represented by two of these divisions - the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta) and the shell itself this advancement allowed the early amniotes to become independent
