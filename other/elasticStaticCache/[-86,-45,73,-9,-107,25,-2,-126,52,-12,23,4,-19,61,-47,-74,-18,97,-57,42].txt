Some human examples of inherited traits are eye color, hair color and the ability to roll one’s tongue. Sometimes the offspring look different from their parents or from the other young.

The \"original\" Ragdoll cat is a large, sweet-natured cat with a variety of myths surrounding its origins. The commonest is that Ragdolls are the result of a female cat which had been hit by a car and whose subsequent litters of kittens were very placid. This is the Lamarckian idea of inheritance - a trait acquired by the parent could be inherited by the offspring. If Lamarck's theory had been correct, many dogs would be born tail-less due to generations of tail-docking. With the car accident tale dismissed by most people, the breeder claimed that the founding mother of her Ragdoll breed had been infused with skunk genes (and even with human genes!) while being treated for her injuries. It was, apparently, some secret experiment. The wonderful thing about conspiracy theories is that people want to believe them and it is incredibly hard to dent their belief because \"it's all part of a big cover up\". Even if the female cat had been infused with skunk genes, those genes could not have been passed on to her offspring because they would not have entered the germ cells (the unripened egg cells in the ovaries). The cat's immune system would have reacted to the injection of foreign material; just as it would to a vaccination or a transfusion of mismatched blood. Some of the colourways of Ragdoll-derivative cats have been seen as evidence of skunk genes rather. They are due to the well-documented \"white spotting\" gene which has been seen in cats for decades. While most breeders distance themselves from pseudo-science, a few adhere to the skunk-gene theory.",1.420067548751831],["Let's look at an example using the gene for the color \"white\". A single gene is a group of instructions of an indeterminate length, and somewhere within all those instructions is the code which will determine whether or not the cat is white or non-white. Since a cat receives two sets of instructions (one from each parent), how is it determined what will happen? Each gene has at least one and sometimes more \"alleles\" which will determine the overall effect. It is the \"allele\" which determines whether a trait is dominant or recessive. In the case of the white cat, the \"make the fur white\" allele, \"W\" is dominant, while the \"make the fur non-white\" allele, \"w\", is recessive. As a result, the fur of this particular cat may be white or non-white only. To further illustrate this, a cat has two and only two white genes. Since each white gene (for purposes of example) consists of one of two alleles, \"W\" or \"w\", a cat may have one of four possible genetic codes (called karyotypes) for white: \"WW\", \"Ww\", \"wW\", and \"ww\". Since \"W\" is dominant to \"w\", any code containing \"W\" (\"WW\", \"Ww\", \"wW\") willl produce white cats, while \"ww\" will always produce a non-white cat.",1.4197028875350952],["Color and striping is controlled by gene groups that are inherited from the parent's genes, the same as hair color in humans.

But not all gingers are male, though most are. The reason is that in cats the colour gene is carried on the X chromosome. As females have two Xs they can express two colours in the coat, and if black is inherited from one parent and ginger (red) from the other, the result is a calico cat. The calico's brother, having only one X chromosome, would be either ginger or black, depending on the colour of the mother. I believe there was a case of an apparently male calico cat but it was found to have a mutation giving an XXY chromosome set-up, and was sterile. For a female to be ginger she would have to inherit red from both parents. This could happen if the father was ginger and the mother tortoiseshell for example. The white is inherited on a separate gene and is independent of the colour gene. It can appear on either sex and with any colour of coat. For some reason not understood it is usually found that in tortoiseshell and white cats the patches of black and ginger are larger and more distinct than in the plain tortoiseshell without white. A tabby pattern of stripes can also be inherited separately, resulting in a cat known as a \"torby\" (Tabby-tortoiseshell).",1.1698836088180542],["It could possibly be the result of some cross breeding between white catfish, which have been in Gorton Pond for decades, and perhaps a channel cat that would have been an introduced fish, most likely from the Connecticut River.",1.1681299209594727],["Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a 'tortoiseshell and white' cat; if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, in North America the cat will be called a calico.",1.1641037464141846],["Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a tortoise shell and white cat or, if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, the cat will be called a calico.",1.1641037464141846],["Perhaps ligers would have inherited this longitudnal trait for its mother the tigress.",1.1578075885772705],["A wolf gets their coloring from their parents, so if the parents have the same coloring, the pup will have the same coloring as them.
