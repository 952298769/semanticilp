tools from vehicle Retrieve the tools listed above from the car and place them within reach If desired, put on the gloves, and place the blocks under the tire opposite the flat Step 3: Loosen the lug nuts Remove the hubcap, if necessary some cars won't have hubcaps... consult your owners' manual for proper instructions in removing the hubcaps Using the lugwrench, begin to loosen the lug nuts sometimes the lug nuts are quite difficult to loosen if you can't loosen them, try jumping on the lug wrench to loosen them Do not remove the lug nuts, only loosen them Step 4: Jack up the vehicle Consult your owners' manual and find where the jack needs to be positioned usually, the jack contacts the car at a small plate on the frame of the car this plate is usually located just in front of the rear tires, and just behind the front tires Position the jack under the car, and raise the jack until it contacts the frame Make sure the jack is properly positioned Extend the jack until the tire is about 6 inches off the ground remember : don't stop raising the car when the flat tire is just off the ground...the spare tire is fully inflated and will require more ground clearance Step 5: Remove the flat tire Remove the lug nuts from the bolts, and put them aside Grab the wheel it is easiest to grab the tire at the \"nine o'clock\" and \"three o'clock\" positions Pull the wheel straight toward you, and off the car Step 6: Put on the spare tire Position the spare tire directly in front of the wheel well Align the holes in the center of the spare tire with the bolts on the car Lift the spare tire and position it on the threaded bolts Push the tire onto the car until it cannot go any farther Replace the lugnuts on the bolts and tighten them, but not too tight...just enough to hold the tire in place while you lower the car Step 7: Lower the vehicle Lower the car with the jack until the car is again resting on all four tires Tighten the lugnuts, starting with one, then moving to the one opposite it, and so on...
