there's a time to play Time to laugh a time to cry Time to be born were all going to die Better watch \nwhat you say Cause you know he knows what's in the heart of man We all have sinned came short of the glory There's none righteous no not one If I say I have no sin call me a liar Better watch what you do cause he knows where you been Hand me down Religion He'd been saved all his life Been brought up on the lie His Father's Father reserved him a place On the front row of saving grace Said he couldn't kneel Cause his suit was too tight He been heard praying sometimes But he's never saw the light He got hand me down, hand me down Hand me down religion He said the church has no business Tampering with a man's soul Cause he swears their ain't no devil Down in no big black hole If the devil doesn't exist If he's a creation of man Then man created the devil In his own image with his own hands Had a cigar in his mouth But he said he didn't smoke Had shoes on his feet But you didn't see him walk Slung cards like throwing knives But you never saw them stick Carried a pearl handled pistol But you never heard the hammer click Said he don't go to church to be preached at He got hand me down religion Business as usual His mouth as dry as a sack of flour Dusty as a lizards back Sitting on the davenport Fishing a cufflinks from a crack He sported two bellies One high one low Held his pants with a diaper pen Never let his pride show Chorus Some say he had his own teeth But I seen him slip'em in and out Jackolantern smile With a head full of cabbage in his mouth Played his nose like harmonica Hair in need of an oil change Smoked ox blood through chicken bones Used god's name in vain Chorus birds nest portland hair He knew she was trailer park trash Barley sky gave him a Pumpernickel rash Chorus Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Heard the sound of rain Dripping from a tin roof into a can of lard Like a tad pole on a dry rivers bed Took a swim to the nearest star I would be president but I'm not without sin You rode the bus while I jumped the fence Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Lived in a shotgun house Close to the tracks Spray painted your name On the over pass Is there grace without gravity faith for the blind The barns are raising the devils killing time I was a writer before I could speak And I spoke before I could think I've stopped to hear a still small voice Giving me freedom Giving me a choice Between the devil and the deep blue sea With jaundiced eyes on the road to perdition Always kept his powder dry All is fair in love and war Pursuing the apple of his eye Between you, me and the lamppost She was dressed to the nines But she tired men with her idle chit chat Not one word worth a cold thin dime Between the devil and the deep blue sea Every cloud has a silver lining Every ocean has a green eyed monster Dyed in the wool and still shinning Feet of clay and a pair of purple valentines Gave him the slip on weaver's run She's running with the hair hunting with the hounds With a slender reed the cat's on the prowl She became penny wise and pound foolish Couldn't make a silk purse out of a sows ear Living in clover squeezing blood from a turnip In a blue funk crying crocodile tears Left no stone unturned smart as a whip More than one way to skin a cat Spit and polish spic and span Bull in the china shop is wearing a brass hat He bought her love for a song She couldn't see the forest for the tree's Half a loaf is better than none Bought a pig in a poke with a head full of steam Action speaks louder than words Cut off her nose with a fish hook to spit her face Heaping coals of fire upon her head She's a millstone around his neck She threw the baby out with the bath water And put bats in the belfry Hell is paved with good intentions And a month of sunday's Don't you judge the preacher Don't call me good, there's only one that's good Jesus came to save sinners of which I am the worst (Drums kick in) Don't you judge the preacher The preacher he is judge God called preaching folly So don't you hold a grudge If you don't have the faith You can't understand it If you have the faith Nothing left to explain I have died to sin Used to walk in these ways Truth are in the headlines At the bottom of a bird cage Had my oxen in a ditch Jesus wept Sunday's turning black The rocks cry out Road Less Traveled The snow fell like butterflies The air was bitter cold I crossed the sugar tree field Warmed my bones in a worm hole Fire by night cloud by day I don't regret one minute along the way When the evening sun Starts sinking low I count my many blessings upon the road Many lay by the way side Cuz the journey is long Lost in their aching heart is desire to move on Road less traveled Jesus lead me home Good morning mule skinner I'm going to move on Mocking bird be singing That I'm not alone When I enter that city paved with gold Pearly gates going to \nopen take me to my home Sky opened up Latter rain began to fall Ushering in the crops As the willows are tall Down by the waters course Remember from where I came Dip my hat in the pool I must be on my way The Last Song Make the Mississippi run backwards Flood waters are going to crest Going to flood the old devil Can't give him no rest The devil going to be running Like a Jack Rabbit out of New Orleans High tail'n it up north That's where he outta be Got to resist his temptations Stomp him under your feet Sun is going to shine on the cotton fields The day that ol' serpent leaves Don't drink from the devils troft He's the father of lies Leaving a trail on the river banks Swore I seen mud in his eye Greater is He that is in me Than he that is in the world Who'll bell the cat A boon companion Promised a chicken in every pot Feast or famine deep six or starve Burning the candle at both ends Crossed the rubicon Nervous tic pulled at the corner of his mouth Jumping like a big mouth bass down south Chorus Light at the end of the tunnel Became a runaway train Wearing jack boots like a gestapo When it pours it rains Fall on stony ground trampled under foot The fats in the fire cats on a hot tin roof Chorus Down at the beauty parlor They gave her a permanent fit Her hair looks like something You'd pound meat with Her hub cap eyes looked at him like a t-bone Like a wild horse stampede But he had loosed his demons And his spirit been set free One Man's Opinion Lost in the Canopy of tree's he never had horse sense Oaks and Pines cap off the skies he wandered through the circus tent Before the eyes of God tried squeezing through a needles eye The

poachers paridise and the squirrels jumping from the tree's Nose as red as a tomato livers spotted with disease The way he plays the game it's never a game of chance Took him many a year to learn this

the rail But the checker players like the tales he tells They seem to want bad news and they always want more He said he'll sleep it off and in the morning shove it under the door Who walked over his

on a goat Readers Digest and a T.V. guide is all the bible he ever read Captain Marvel and Wonder Women the mom and dad he never had On a dark Kentucky night about to take a bullet in the back He saw Jesus standing there by the caution sign Ain't no devil in the fiery furnace in the burning bush In the lions den pushing this pen Going to raise the dead sleeping in my bed Going to open blind eyes can satisfy At the pearly gates walking on the lake On the mountain top going to steal and rob By the river side going to baptize Going to dry those eyes ain't no devil going to crash them skies It all came crashing down timber tumbled to the ground With a tobacco tan he climbed thin air Life's too short to box with God promised he would not spare the rod Surrendered to Jesus in the back of a Corvair Ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's all I have But sometimes she makes me sad When i'm tempted by her skin I got a girl she looks so fine But she wants too much of my time When i'm tempted by her hair Chorus I love Jesus more than I love you Cause he ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's first class But sometimes she goes too fast When i'm tempted by the speed If I plant a tree If I plant a tree today I may never sit under its shade But I look at the dirt on my hands And I wonder why God made man I hold my sons in my arms Could I send them away to war I see the trust in their eyes And I wander if God cries I look up at the stars And I wonder where you are Are you looking back down at me Your as far as the eye can see It must have been some sacrifice Ask your son to

this water and no one else around no there was no one else around we couldn't resist the ocean call it's only water after all she lifted up her head and yelled, &quot;i'm coming home&quot; i stood on the shore in silent stare but the creast broke to early and took her tumbling down and the undertoe held on so she couldn't breathe the air in a moment we'll pass by the dunes see the sun echo off the
