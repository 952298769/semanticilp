(Years 2-8) Examination of soils and their importance to plants and ecosystems Soil testing Worms and other soil mini-beasts up close Construction of a mini-wormery Each student plants their own seeds Environments up close (Years 2-8) Environmental awareness and appreciation Introduction to habitat types Minibeast investigations Potting up of seeds by each student Environmental walk in local bushland Pond Life (Years 1-6) Exploration of the differences between land and water plants at our mini-wetland Collection of the creatures of the wetland Identification of the components and links in this ecosystem A model ecosystem is constructed by the students to take back to school Crazy Critters (Years 5-10) - minibeasts in soil and water Exploration \nof the concepts of ecosystems and adaptations Students compare and contrast the different physical conditions, plants and animals (mini-beasts) in a wet and dry ecosystem Students collect and examine worms and other soil mini-beasts and water creatures Bush Tucker (Years 2-10) A look at the traditional relationships the Aboriginal people have with the land and its plants Activities include grinding seeds, making string, tasting damper and bush fruitsm producing a pot of wattle seeds to grow and trying bark painting, fire-making and animal tracking skills One World, One Chance (Years 2-8) Exploration of the environmental impact of humans Practical, positive solutions are introduced A model compost bin is constructed Each student pots up their own native plant seeds to grow for the environment Designed to Survive

bottom of each carton Fill with potting soil and plant the seeds Keep moist Grow the plants under a fluorescent lamp Record your results on a graph Procedure B: After 14 days pull the plants Wash off the dirt and dry with a paper towel Weight the plants and record the results on a graph Procedure C: Dry the plants in the sun until they are crisp Weight plants and record the results on a graph
