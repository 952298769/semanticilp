deep, rich, moist soil that at times can be wet, but a mature tree with a fully established root system adapts to drier soils with resulting Summer interior leaf drop propagated by seeds or rooted cuttings Magnolia Family, with several relatively minor disease and insect problems, but aphids can cause the cosmetic secondary problem of their honeydew secretion causing sooty mold buildup on the leaves moderately available, primarily in ball and burlap form young trees that have been root-pruned (i.e., transplanted in a balled and burlaped state) should be regulary watered for at least three years following transplanting Tuliptree is extremely sensitive to being transplanted in the Autumn (a general characteristic of fleshy-rooted and coarsely-rooted woody plants), and extra care should be taken to amend the soil, fertilize, water thoroughly, mulch adequately, and avoid Winter salt spray, to enhance survival chances during the first Winter, if transplanting cannot be delayed until Spring F oliage medium green, alternate, and broadly ovate, overall with a square shape, with both a truncate base and a truncate, shallowly wedge-shaped apex, having several shallow lateral lobes and a long petiole the bilateral halves of the leaf blade are folded into flag-like outline at leaf emergence, then separate like a butterfly's wings at the midrib as the leaf expands distinctive rounded stipules occur at the base of each petiole on the young leaves, abscising during the Summer due to the wide, flat leaf base and long petiole, the leaf blade flutters in the slightest breeze often has limited defoliation of yellowing leaves in the interior of the tree by late July to early August as a response to Summer drought (and is therefore an indicator plant for drought conditions) one of the best trees for yellow to \ngolden-yellow fall color F lowers large, solitary, showy flowers have six yellow-green petals surrounded by three green sepals and resemble a huge tulip (hence the common name) interior of the flower contains a bright orange and yellow corolla, surrounding the central spire of immature aggregate fruits flowering in late May and throughout June often the tree does not flower until it reaches at least 15 years of age, and even then only sparsely in the uppermost reaches of the tree, making the upright-held flowers more difficult to notice and appreciate older trees flower heavily and their lowermost branches become pendulous, allowing for visualization of the beautiful flowers up-close F ruits each fruit is a green to chartreuse aggregate of samaras in the shape
