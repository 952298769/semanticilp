most of the time, species stay about the same, and only occasionally do new ones form the number of individuals involved in the transition will be very few, compared to those involved in the period of stability, so the chances of finding fossils of the transitional individuals will be very low but evolutionary theory suggests some possibilities about how new species could form But first, we need two more useful concepts: character displacement and reinforcement these are not in themselves processes of speciation but they come in handy for understanding the processes of speciation that we are about to look at character displacement : a mechanism that may increase the existing differences in characteristics between two variant populations that are in competition with each other say two populations of birds have diverged considerably, such that one is well adapted to a wet environment, and the other to a dry environment if they are allowed to mix again, the dry-adapted individuals will be favored in dry areas, and the wet-adapted individuals will be favored in wet areas any wet-adapted birds who were a bit towards the dry-adapted end of their population's range of variation will have strong competition from the dry-adapted birds and vice versa that is, any individuals who happen to be more intermediate in character will be out-competed by their own kind in their native environment, and by the other kind in the other environment so individuals who tend to be intermediate in type will be selected against, and the two populations will evolve apart towards adaptations that are specialized for their own ecological niche character displacement clearly does occur in nature see the three charts on page 102 some islands have only medium ground finches, which have relatively deep beaks other islands have only small ground finches, which have relatively shallow beaks still other islands have both kinds of finches but when both kinds are present, the small ground finches have even shallower beaks and the medium ground finches have even deeper beaks that is, the characteristics that distinguish the two species are more exaggerated on islands where they live together presumed \nreason: character displacement those small finches that have beaks on the large end of their normal range are out-competed for the large seeds by the even deeper-beaked medium finches that is, they pay the costs of a small finch with a deep beak, but the other species beats them out of the benefit of getting the larger seeds so they do not survive and reproduce as well, and the average beak depth of the small finch goes down those medium finches that have beaks on the small end of their normal range are out-competed for smaller seeds by the small finches so the average beak depth of the medium finches goes up reinforcement : a mechanism that can increase the reproductive isolation between two variant populations that might still interbreed reinforcement can occur in a situation in which hybrids (offspring of matings between parents of two different types) are less successful than offspring of mates of the same type such as the case with the small finches and the medium finches, in which the hybrids lose out in competition with either purebred type in this case, selection will favor individuals who tend to mate with their own kind, and avoid mating with the other kind because they produce fewer of the less-fit hybrids, and more of the successful purebred offspring individuals who tend to mate with their own kind (and not the other kind) will produce more successful offspring those offspring will also inherit the tendency to mate with their own kind, since their parents had that preference so the tendency to mate with their own kind will become more common so eventually the populations become largely or completely isolated from each other from that point on, there is no mixing (no gene flow), so the two populations are free to evolve further off in their own directions the behavior that leads to this tendency to mate with one's own kind could be anything, as long as it has that effect it might be that the pure-breeding individuals mate at certain times of the day or year or are attracted to certain mating displays or physical features or anything else that results in their more often picking their own kind to mate with both of these processes serve to exaggerate or accelerate speciation, or help to lock-in changes that are leading to speciation we will look at three processes of speciation allopatric speciation: \"in different countries\" parapatric speciation: \"in neighboring countries\" sympatric speciation: \"in the same country\" these differ mainly in the amount of physical separation they require between the diverging populations allopatric speciation : speciation that occurs when two populations that are geographically isolated from each other diverge far enough to form distinct species \"allopatric\": \"in different countries\" that is, the two populations are separated by a physical barrier or great distance, like lizards on two different islands, or fish in two different lakes causing them to be reproductively isolated from each other if the selection pressures on the two isolated populations are different, they may evolve in different directions until the two populations are sufficiently different to be called separate species another hypothetical bird example finches from a wet island get blown to a dry island.",0.6237091422080994],["Cold highs have a moderate or shallow vertical

evolution of life-WILLIAM SMITH (1769-1839), in the course of working on canal excavations all over England, noticed that the same series of fossil assemblages could be found again and again-he was eventually able to predict both the order of fossil assemblages and the thickness of a given stratum at any locality before a hole was even dug-he could do this because he realized that the slabs of sedimentary rock were draped over he each other like a stack of really thick blankets on a badly made bed-each layer had a characteristic group of fossils in it that were found where ever that layer of rock was found-Smith had been in charge of digging a lot of holes and had traced each stratum laterally over great distances Smith, like most engineers, was not a philosopher and drew no grand conclusions from his work-it was simply a practical tool to use in canal and mine construction-he didn't care whether the fossils represented organic remains or were simply \"sports of nature\"-he had no interest in whether or not he was documenting the evolution of the earth, but other people looked at his work and realized that he was Smith invented STRATIGRAPHY without realizing its implications-we will get to this topic later in the semester-for now it is important to realized that Smith used FOSSILS to create an ORDINAL SYSTEM for organizing rocks-an ordinal system is one that imposes order by describing a unique series of events-anywhere you find any part of that unique series of events, you have found a part of that system-in this case the system was describing the series of events that is the history of the earth-the events are recognized by the groups of fossils that define them on a much shorter timescale think of the artifacts that characterize the post-war decades in US history-if you see black&amp;white TVs, cars with big tail fins, women wearing bobby sox and men wearing pompadours, you know you are within about 5 years of 1957-if you see lava lamps, leather jackets with long fringes, and eight track tapes, you know you are within 5 year of 1967-and so on-paleontologists do the same thing with fossils, except they have look at rocks and sediments instead of archive footage in libraries and boxes in attics this means that to understand the evolution of the earth, it would help if you could recognize some fossils-in order to keep all the fossils straight, it will help if you know how biota are classified EARLIEST FOSSIL EVIDENCE it is possible, in theory, that whole other kingdoms of biota existed, but we have found no fossil evidence as yet earliest fossils are of prokaryotic organisms in rocks ~3.5 billion years old-this is approximately a billion years after the earth \nis thought to have formed and is in the early part of what is called the ARCHEAN EON the cells of prokaryotes lack nuclei and the DNA is not arranged in chromosomes-modern representatives include the misnamed \"blue-green algae\" or CYANOBACTERIA-cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and produced much of the free oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for subsequent life forms-modern cyanobacteria look very similar to their fossilized ancestors preserved in rocks that are billions of years old cyanobacteria accumulate in mats in shallow saline waters and biomineralize calcite-the layer of bacteria smothers and a new layer forms over it, along with a new layer of calcite-the resulting structure is called a STROMATOLITE-they have been found in Archean rocks and they still grow today in a few isolated locations in western Australia, Belize, and the Bahamas LIFE GETS MORE COMPLICATED the first eukaryotes, cells with nuclei and chromosomes, appear in the fossil record at 1.4 billion years before present-this part of the geological time scale is called the PROTEROZOIC EON-there is good evidence that eukaryotes arose from symbiotic combinations of prokaryotic organisms-the presence of mitochondrial DNA distinct from cellular DNA was one of the earlier pieces of evidence toward this theory, which has been championed by Lynn Margulis since the 1970s-modern examples of single-celled eukaryotes include yeasts, many types of algae, protozoans like Amoeba and Paramecium and marine microplankton the oldest known eukaryotes are green algae-these fossils are found in rocks that may be as old as 2.0 Ba and are definitely at least 1.8 Ba-fossil prokaryotes are told from fossil eukaryotes based mostly on size-modern prokaryotes are rarely as large as 60 microns, while modern eukaryotes are typically more than 200 microns long-eurkaryotic organisms require AEROBIC conditions (free oxygen is present) to survive-these fossils tell us that earth's atmosphere had become aerobic by 2.0 Ba-by 1.25 Ba the first multicellular algae (seaweeds) had appeared in the fossil record the Bitter Springs Formation in central Australia was deposited 0.8-0.75 Ba-fossils of green algae occur in TETRADS in these rocks, which is consistent with MEIOTIC CELL DIVISION typical of eukaryotes and unknown in prokaryotes LIFE GETS MULTICELLULAR late Proterozoic trace fossils of burrows suggest the presence of primitive worms from nearly 700 Ma-the shapes of the burrows suggest that the organisms that made them were more rigid than a single-celled motile organism could be-even multicellular organisms without skeletons of any kind can make their bodies more rigid than the cell membrane of a single-celled organism EDIACARAN (or VENDIAN) FAUNA-in Ediacara Hills of Flinders Range in western Australia-670 Ma-soft-parts of about 30 different large multi-cellular animals are preserved as MOLDS-mixture of recognizable forms, like worms, and body plans that do not resemble any subsequent life forms-few of the Ediacaran fauna belong to familiar phyla-some workers believe that they may not be the ancestors of later metazoans, but an entire kingdom that did not survive the Proterozoic-however, the Ediacaran fauna does include undisputed Cnidaria, which do have modern relative, but are not ancestral to most metazoans For more on this topic see Ediacaran fauna a significant aspect of the Ediacaran fauna is that it made up of HETEROTROPHS-organisms that eat other organisms or detris for nutrition-all previous life forms had been AUTOTROPHIC and produced their own food through either photosynthesis or chemosythesis MULTICELLULARITY CATCHES ON by the end of the Proterozoic three of the five surviving kingdoms had evolved-the Monera, the Protoctista and the Animalia-the Cnidaria of the Ediacararan fauna are the first acoelomates-the first coelomates occur in the last 35 m.y. of the Proterozoic, an interval called the TOMMOTIAN-these animals are referred to as the SMALL SCALY FAUNA (or Tommotian fauna)-they are typically less than 2 mm and the 'shells' are composed of CALCIUM PHOSPHATE-few of these 'shells' appear to cover complete animals, but instead are pieces of more extensive armoring CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION in the lower Cambrian there a geologically sudden increase in the diversity of life preserved to the fossil record-representatives of two different kingdoms-the Protoctista and the Animalia-independently developed BIOMINERALIZATION-the manufacture of minerals by living organisms-while the organisms were alive, these biomineralized skeletons probably provided protection from predation and from the physical elements-after the organism died it provides geologists with a record of the organism's existence-the shells of many biota that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion were made of calcium phoshate-apparently the environment was very rich in phosphate at the time-later the most common biominerals became CALCIUM CARBONATE and SILICA SAMPLE PRODUCTS OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION kingdom PROTOCTISTA phylum SARCOMASTIGOPHORA foraminifera radiolaria kingdom ANIMALIA phylum PORIFERA sponges phylum ARCHEOCYATHA (Cambrian only) phylum ARTHROPODA (e.g., trilobites) phylum MOLLUSCA (e.g., clams, snails, nautiloids) phylum ECHINODERMATA (e.g., starfish, urchins, crinoids) the emergence of large 'shelly' metazoans and protists with mineral shells vastly increased the volume of the fossil record-exoskeletons were either AGGLUTINATED (pieces of sediment glued together) or SECRETED (biomineralized) trilobites appeared ~527 Ma and typically comprised more than 90% of the shelly fauna of the Cambrian period-inarticulate brachiopods comprised 5-7% and the other phyla make up the remainder-despite the dominance of the trilobites nearly all the other existing phyla (including the chordates) first appeared during the 30 m.y. that make up the Cambrian period THE BURGESS SHALE in addition to phyla that still exist, several phyla developed during the Cambrian (or the Proterozoic and existed until the Cambrian), but did not survive into the Ordovician period-we know this because of the discovery of LAGERSTATTEN in a few locations around the world-these deposits preserve fossilized remains of both the shelly hard-parts and outlines of the organic \nsoft parts of a fauna the Burgess Shale is located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia and is a middle Cambrian rock formation-when it was first discovered in the early 20th century by Charles Doolittle Walcott the fauna were shoe-horned into existing phyla because at the time paleontologists could not conceive of entire extinct phyla-in the 1960s and 70s the fossils were re-examined-the fossils that were entirely soft-bodied organisms were reassigned to newly erected phyla-the 'Burgess Shale fauna' has since been found in other middle Cambrian lagerstatten around the world, but not in any younger lagerstatten a large majority (98",0.6077241897583008],["Task 2: Animal Investigation Many animals

that keeps them from getting waterlogged animal dispersal seeds may have spines or hooks that help them adhere to fur or feathers C] FRUITS - GREEN VS. RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",0.5595390200614929],["Several different soil fungi, some of which can survive in the soil for many years, are responsible for the characteristic leaf reddening, and stunted and discolored root systems.",0.5585492849349976],["This helps the plant to develop a thick, robust root system, which enables them to survive the elements better.",0.5584912896156311],["The roots protect themselves against pests and control their rhizosphere organisms by bioactive chemicals, which often also have medicinal properties.",0.5581691861152649],["living organisms depend on one another and on their environment for survival producers and consumers are related in food chains and may compete with each other for resources in an ecosystem decomposers recycle matter from dead plants and animals ecosystems can be characterized by their living and nonliving components some kinds of animals survive well, some less well, and some can not survive at all Grade 5 , Life Sciences: Plants and animals have structures for respiration, digestion, waste disposal, and transport of materials how blood circulates and how carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged sequential steps of digestion and the roles of teeth, mouth, and organs in the digestive system the role of kidneys in removing cell u lar waste from blood Grade 6 , Ecology: Organisms in ecosystems exchange energy and nutrients among themselves and with the environment energy is transfered through photosynthesis and then from organism to organism through food webs matter is transferred from one organism to others in the food web and between organisms and the physical environment organisms can be categorized by the functions they serve in an ecosystem different kinds of organisms may play similar ecological roles in similar biomes the number or types of organisms an ecosystem can suport depends of the resources available and on abiotic factors Grade 7 , Structure and Function in Living Systems: The anatomy and physiology of animals illustrate the complementary nature of structure and function.",0.5574803352355957],["They also have deep roots that protect them from the cold winter, keep dry soil in place, and reduce erosion.",0.5573228597640991],["hile they do not exactly scream, some caterpillars have noise-making organs, and the sound they produce is used to call in troops of ants to protect them from predatory wasps.",0.5563966631889343],["This cold temperature of the body, which decreases metabolism, helps to protect major organ systems from ischemic injury (lack of blood flow to an organ of the body that results in damage to that organ).",0.5555771589279175],["Cold, arctic air flows south from the high.",0.5555756688117981],["Trees established from cuttings will have a shallow root system and a short bole.",0.5551614165306091],["Gift exchange systems have their roots in the culture from which they spring and their survival depends on the health of those roots.",0.5549554824829102],["desiccation of the Aral Sea and associated dust storms caused by the diversion of water to irrigation projects in Central Asia could be lessened by ending the diversion and finding alternative water sources) Geography Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems By the end of the twelfth grade, the student knows and understands: How changes in the physical environment can diminish its capacity to support human activity Strategies to respond to constraints placed on human systems by the physical environment How humans perceive and react to natural hazards Therefore, the student is able to: A. Analyze examples of changes in the physical environment that have reduced the capacity of the environment to support human activity, as exemplified by being able to Describe and evaluate the carrying capacity of selected regions to predict the likely consequence of exceeding their environmental limits (e.g., the impact of the economic exploitation of Siberias resources on a fragile sub-Arctic environment) Develop contemporary and historical case studies to serve as examples of the limited ability of physical systems to withstand human pressure or of situations in which the environments quality and ability to support human populations has diminished because of excessive use (e.g., the drought-plagued Sahel, the depleted rain forests of central Africa, the Great Plains Dust Bowl) Develop a model using concepts of synergy, feedback loops, carrying capacity, and thresholds to describe the limits of physical systems in different environments to absorb the impacts of human activities B. Apply the concept of limits to growth to suggest ways to adapt to or overcome the limits imposed on human systems by physical systems, as exemplified by being able to Describe the limits to growth found in physical environments and describe ways in which techonology and human adaptation enable people to expand the capacity of such environments Describe the conditions and locations of soil types (e.g., soils with limited nutrients, high salt contect, shallow depth) that place limits on plant growth and therefore on the expansion of human settlement and suggest alternative uses for areas of those soil types Identify physical environments in which limits to growth are significant (e.g., extremely cold, arid, or humid tropical climates and mountainous and coastal environments), describe the conditions that may threaten humans in these environments (e.g., rises in population that place pressure on marginal areas), and then develop plans to alleviate such stresses C. Explain the ways in which individuals and societies hold varying perceptions of natural hazards in different environments and have different ways of reacting to them, as exemplified by being able to Collect personal and group responses to different natural hazards before, during, and after the event, and summarize the varying perceptions of natural hazards in different regions of the world Conduct interviews to assess peoples attitudes, perceptions, and responses toward natural hazards in the local community and explain patterns that may emerge (e.g., the effects of religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, previous experience, and other factors on perception and responses toward hazards) Evaluate the effectiveness of human attempts to limit damage from natural hazards and explain how people who live in naturally hazardous religions adapt to their environments (e.g., the use of sea walls to protect coastal areas subject to severe storms, the use of earthquake-resistant construction techniques in different regions within the Ring of Fire Geography Standard 16: The changes that occur in the meaning, use, distribution, and importance of resources By the end of the twelfth grade, the student knows and understands: How the spatial distribution of resources affects patterns of human settlement How resource development and use change over time The geographic results of policies and programs for resource use and management Therefore, the student is able to: A.
