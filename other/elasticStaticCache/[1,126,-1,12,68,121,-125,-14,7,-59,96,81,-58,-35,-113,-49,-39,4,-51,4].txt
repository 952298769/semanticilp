What is a circuit (pronounced \"ser-kit\")? A circuit is like a path through which electricity flows. A circuit needs to be made out of a conductor, which is a material that electricity can flow through easily. Conductors are usually made out of metals like copper. An insulator is the opposite of a conductor; electricity cannot flow through it. Many everyday materials—like wood, plastics, and rubber—are insulators.

Starting with the power source, electricity is run through a control panel or thermostat to a radiant heating cable which houses conductor line(s), a ground line, insulation, and a heat shield. Both single conductor lines and twin conductor lines exist. These heating lines come in basic lines that you space yourself or in pre-spaced mats. As resistance is built in the conductor wire it produces heat through conduction into the surrounding materials. As these flooring materials (concrete, tile, wood, etc.) heat up, the living space above is warmed through radiation. The system can be controlled at an on-wall thermal sensor, in-floor thermal sensor, or both.",2.1117560863494873],["When you first learn about electricity , you discover that materials fall into two basic categories called conductors and insulators. Conductors (such as metals ) let electricity flow through them; insulators (such as plastics and wood ) generally do not. But nothing's quite so simple, is it? Any substance will conduct electricity if you put a big enough voltage across it: even air, which is normally an insulator, suddenly becomes a conductor when a powerful voltage builds up in the clouds—and that's what makes lightning. Rather than talking about conductors and insulators, it's often clearer to talk about resistance: the ease with which something will let electricity flow through it. A conductor has low resistance, while an insulator has much higher resistance. Devices called resistors let us introduce precisely controlled amounts of resistance into electrical circuits. Let's take a closer look at what they are and how they work!",2.080071210861206],["Materials like copper and aluminum that one normally thinks of as good electrical conductors have resistant that is more than a billion times smaller than wet wood.",2.07778000831604],["Materials like copper and aluminum that one normally thinks of as good electrical conductors have resistant that is more than a billion times smaller than wet wood.",2.07778000831604]]
