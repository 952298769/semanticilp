DRAFT April 10, 2014 119 Read about where magnets came from. Activity 2. Attract or Repel! Background Information A bar magnet is a rectangular-shaped magnet. Each end of a bar magnet is called a pole. One pole is called north and the other is called south. A bar magnet when suspended freely will align itself so that the north pole points towards the Earthâ€™s magnetic north pole. The north pole of the magnet is usually painted red. The strength of a magnet is strongest at the poles. When the north and south poles of two bar magnets are brought close to each other, they attract or stick together. When the north poles of two bar magnets are brought close to each other they repel. The same thing will happen to two south poles of two bar magnets that are brought close to each other. Thus, unlike poles attract and like poles repel Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. identify the poles of a magnet; 2. infer that a magnet has two poles; 3. state that like poles repel; unlike poles attract; and 4. infer that the strength of the magnet is strongest at the poles.

Motivation/Presentation SN SN S N SN S N SN",1.8053710460662842],["You can turn a paper clip into a magnet by rubbing a strong magnet several times over the surface of the paper clip. The more you drag the magnet over the paper clip, the stronger the paper clip will become magnetized. The same thing happened with the metal in the experiment. When we rubbed the magnet over the surface of the metal, some of the magnetic domains aligned and the metal became partially magnetized. When we rubbed the magnet over the metal a second time, more of the magnetic domains became aligned and the metal became a stronger magnet.",1.6737762689590454],["Maybe you have seen how magnets attract paper clips and pins?",1.6076678037643433],["Have you ever played with magnets, sticking them together and pulling them apart? Maybe you have seen how magnets attract paper clips and pins? Have you ever felt that tug when you tried to remove something from the magnet? If you have, then you have experienced the effects of magnetic fields. A magnetic field creates a force (a push or a pull) on other magnets or magnetic materials in the field. This force has a magnitude (meaning it can be strong or weak) and a direction. It can be attractive (meaning it attracts or pulls on magnetic materials or other magnets) or repulsive (meaning it repels or pushes away other magnets).

Make sure that your magnet stages are the correct distance (10 cm) apart (see Figure 4 in the Experimental Procedure). If the magnets are 10 cm apart but you still have problems with them coming together before you can tape them in place, gradually increase the space between each of the magnets until they stay where you put them. Whatever spacing you settle on, put the same amount of space between all the magnet stages in your Gauss rifle.",1.2944945096969604],["We all knew the basics of magnets and magnetism -- magnets attract specific metals, and they have north and south poles.",1.255805492401123]]
