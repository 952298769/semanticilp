The tidal forces of the Sun have over eons of time slowed down the rotation of Mercury to match its revolution around the Sun. The result is that Mercury rotates very slowly. One day on Mercury is about 58-1/2 Earth days long. But while Mercury's days are very long, its revolution around the Sun is rather fast. Mercury can complete one orbit around the Sun in only 88 Earth days. That's just about 3 months here on Earth. This is why Mercury's name is so appropriate. In mythology, Mercury was a speedy messenger, just like the planet's speedy revolution around the Sun.",1.6547054052352905]]
