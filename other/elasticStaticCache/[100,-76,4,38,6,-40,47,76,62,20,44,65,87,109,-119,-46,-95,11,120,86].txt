excretory and respiratory systems, exchange by diffusion Not closely related to other two classes SUBPHYLUM CRUSTACEA: CRUSTACEANS Arrangement and Nature of Appendages Two pairs of antennae, three pairs of chewing appendages Number of legs varies with the species All are biramous Excluding first pair of antennae Single-branched appendages previously biramous, one branch lost in evolution Evolution of crustaceans All descended from common ancestor as evidenced by nauplius larvae fig 41.4 Some groups lack larvae and undergo direct development into adult General Biology Have legs on abdomen and thorax like millipedes and centipedes (unlike insects) Only arthropods with two pair of antennae Mandibles evolved from limbs that developed a chewing function Many have compound eyes and tactile hairs over whole body Have feathery gills near base of legs Excretion of nitrogen wastes occurs mostly across surface of cuticle Osmotic composition of blood regulated by labyrinth or green

mouthparts Sense of smell located on antennae Sound detected by tympanum, associated with tracheal air sacs fig 41.6a Sensory hairs may also detect sound waves Insect communication Produce sounds which are mostly inaudible to humans Produce chemicals called pheromones Life histories Most insects hatch from eggs outside of the mother`s body Young insects undergo regular ecdysis, stages called instars Simple metamorphosis fig 41.30 Wings develop during juvenile stages Immature stages generally called nymphs Complete metamorphosis fig 41.30 Wings appear only during resting stage just prior to final molt Resting stage called a pupa or chrysalis fig 41.31 Pupa does not normally move, except mosquitos Juveniles and adults live in distinct habitats Development is indirect, larvae are wormlike Larva do not have compound eyes Larvae may or may not have legs fig 41.28,30,31 Generally have chewing mouthparts Pupa generally are usually inactive and do not feed Juvenile hormone controls ecdysis and molting via ecdysone fig 41.32 DEUTEROSTOMES Embryological Feature Shared by Four Phyla Echinodermata, Chordata and two smaller groups Four phyla share common ancestry Characteristics Blastopore becomes anus, mouth develops at other end Have radial cleavage Daughter cells are identical for a brief period of time Produce whole individual if separated Individuals are identical in genetic makeup Whole groups of cells move during embryonic development Coelom produced by evagination of archenteron Archenteron becomes gut cavity PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA: THE ECHINODERMS General Ecology of Echinoderms Ancient group of marine animals, well-represented in fossil record Name means \"spiny skin\" fig 41.33 Examples: sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers Basic Features of Echinoderms Have epidermis stretched over an internal skeleton Endoskeleton composed of ossicles: movable or fixed calcium plates Plates enclosed within living tissue when first formed Bear spines as indicated by phylum`s name Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple but complete: mouth, gut and anus Capable of extensive regeneration Some animals may drop parts when attacked May reproduce asexually by splitting into parts Sexual reproduction and fertilization is external Sexes are separate, but difficult to distinguish externally Develop into free-swimming, bilaterally symmetrical larvae fig 41.35 Significantly different from annelid/mollusk trochophore larvae Larvae possess bands of cilia, used for locomotion Diversity of Echinoderms Class Crinoidea: the sea lilies and feather stars fig 41.33c,36 Mouth and anus located on upper surface in an open disk Simple excretory and reproductive systems Extensive water vascular system Large numbers of highly branched arms located around central disk Filter feeders, food collected by mucus from tube feet on pinnules Sea lilies are attached to a substrate by a stalk Feather stars detach from stalks early in development, attach to substrate by claw-like structures Sexes separate, external fertilization Females \nmay brood young Crinoids resemble early fossil echinoderms Class Asteroidea: the sea stars Most familiar echinoderms, the \"starfish\" fig 41.33a,34 Active, important marine predators Arms prominent and set off from the disk, generally five in number Mouth located in center of the lower surface Often feed on bivalve mollusks fig 41.37 Sexes separate, external fertilization Females may brood young Class Ophiuroidea: the brittle stars fig 41.33d Slender arms more sharply set off from central disk than sea stars Move by active movement of their arms along the substrate Capture suspended particles with tube feet, long spines or arms Arms detach readily, helping protect animals from predators Class Echinoidea: the sea urchins and sand dollars fig 41.33e,f Lack distinct arms, but retain familiar five-part body plan Five rows of tube feet protrude through plates of the skeleton Skeletons are made up of fused calcareous plates Walk along substrate with tube feet or movement of spines Feed on algae, debris scraped off the surfaces by triangular teeth Reproduction similar to other echinoderms Larvae have long arms, unlike those of other classes Class Holothuroidea: the sea cucumbers fig 41.33b Soft, sluglike organisms with tough, leathery outer skin Most lie on sides at the bottom of the ocean Mouth is located on one end Surrounded by tube feet modified into tentacles Tentacles secrete mucus to trap food particles Calcareous skeleton reduced to widely separated, microscopic plates Have highly branched respiratory trees that originate from cloaca Water brought into and out of cloaca by muscular contractions Gas exchange occurs across the respiratory trees Have tube feet on body, may be restricted to five grooves Move by tube feet or wriggling of the entire body
