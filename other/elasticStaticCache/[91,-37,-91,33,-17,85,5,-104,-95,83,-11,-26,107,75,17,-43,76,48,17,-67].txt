They have several adaptations for arboreal life. They have parallax vision which is the slight distance that the eyes are separated and allows a squirrel to judge distances when jumping and squirrels can jump eighteen feet with their strong rear legs. Squirrels have color vision but are blue and yellow colorblind. They can see details very well and have the ability to recognize individual squirrels several yards away. The gray squirrel_s toes, which are longer and more flexible than a fox squirrel_s toes, are better for clinging to vertical surfaces. Some animals can only climb trees that they can get their limbs around but a squirrel can climb any tree no matter how large and when descending, the back legs can rotate one hundred and eighty degrees to allow the sharp, rear claws to hook into the bark. This allows the squirrel to be quite agile and move very rapidly in the trees even going down a tree headfirst. Watching squirrels has shown me that the gray squirrel develop habits.

Hunting of small mammals has been observed rarely in chimpanzees and baboons. The range in which monkeys and apes forage is small, varying from much less than a square mile in gibbons to some fifteen square miles in baboons and gorillas. From a human point of view it is remarkable that animals with keen eyesight, who are capable of climbing into trees and surveying the scene and who are well adapted for locomotion on the ground, so restrict their normal activities. It is probable that hunting is the behavioral adaptation that caused the change in man’s relation to his physical environment. Intensive hunting would drive game from a small range, and the location of game and the pursuit of wounded animals would lead to the establishment of large territories. In most non-human primates ranges are not defended, and the areas occupied by groups of monkeys or apes usually overlap.

For example, mountain goats have padded hooves to grip the rocks on which they climb, giraffes are tall to reach the leaves of tall trees, and frogs have long, sticky tongues to catch insects to eat, and are colored brown or green to match their environments so that predators do not notice them.
