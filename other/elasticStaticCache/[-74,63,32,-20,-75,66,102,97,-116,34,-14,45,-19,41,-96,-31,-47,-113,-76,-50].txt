Matter can change state based on heat or temperature. There are three states that matter can take depending on its temperature: solid, liquid, and gas. For example, if water is cold and its molecules are moving very slow, it will be a solid (ice). If it warms up some, the ice will melt and water becomes a liquid. If you add a lot of heat to water, the molecules will move very fast and it will become a gas (steam).",2.1344780921936035],["melting point, temperature at which a substance changes its state from solid to liquid.",2.1229734420776367],["The heat of fusion of a substance is the amount of heat needed to change 1 kg of it at its melting point from the solid to the liquid state.",2.1229734420776367],["The heat of fusion of a substance is the amount of heat needed to change 1 kg of it at its melting point from the solid to the liquid state.",2.1229734420776367],["A melting point is a temperature that, when reached, changes the state of a substance from a solid to a liquid.",2.1099483966827393],["A melting point is a temperature that, when reached, changes the state of a substance from a solid to a liquid.",2.1099483966827393],["Freezing involves changing water from its liquid state to its solid state (ice) by the removal of heat.",2.107966423034668],["When an ice cube melts for example, it becomes liquid water.",2.1036529541015625],["Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from solid to liquid state.",2.095618963241577],["Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from solid to liquid state.",2.095618963241577],["MELTING POINT Temperature at which a substance changes from the solid to liquid state.",2.095618963241577],["C When a substance melts it changes from a solid to a liquid.",2.091930627822876],["The melting point is the temperature when a substance changes from solid to liquid.",2.091930627822876],["The melting point is the temperature when a substance changes from solid to liquid.",2.091930627822876],["When a substance melts, it changes phase from a solid to a liquid by the application of heat.",2.091930627822876],["C When a substance melts it changes from a solid to a liquid.",2.091930627822876],["When a substance melts, it changes phase from a solid to a liquid by the application of heat.",2.091930627822876],["Melting is the process of changing something from a solid into a liquid (like ice into liquid water).",2.0915136337280273],["The melting point is a fundamental parameter that constitutes the physical properties of Thulium.
