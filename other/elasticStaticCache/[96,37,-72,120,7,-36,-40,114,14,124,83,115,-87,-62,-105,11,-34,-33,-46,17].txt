Thermometers are used to measure outside and inside temperature, body temperature, oven temperature, and food temperature. Most thermometers measure by direct contact with the air, although infrared thermometers use sensors to detect infrared radiation coming off of surfaces and estimate temperature that way (similar to the way night-vision goggles work).Â  A common thermometer is the mercury thermometer used outside residential areas. The volume of the mercury changes as the outside temperature changes. The volume of the liquid expands as it heats up, representing an increase in temperature, and the liquid contracts when it cools down, representing a decrease in temperature. At modern weather stations an electronic temperature sensor is used to measure the outside air temperature. The temperature sensor on this device is contained within a vented unit which allows air to flow freely across the sensor and measure the temperature while keeping the thermometer shaded from the direct heating of the sun.",2.275787830352783],["Liquid-in-Glass thermometer The liquid-in-glass thermometer is one of the most common instruments used today to measure
