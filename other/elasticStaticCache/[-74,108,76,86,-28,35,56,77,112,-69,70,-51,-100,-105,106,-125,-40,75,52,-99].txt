lining of the stomach pylorus - narrow passage which connects the stomach with the small intestine Pyloric sphincter - muscle that controls the flow between the stomach and the Duodenum Columnar

helps kill most bacteria Present in food, it does not digest food but does break down Connective tissue found in meat and activates pepsin Mucous secreted by the goblet cells protects the stomach lining from the acidity If the HCI penetrates the mucous, the wall can begin to break down - it is now believed That Helicobacter pylon (bacteria) impairs the ability of epithelial cells to Produce

portion - from the jejunum to the cecum of the large intestine Ileocecal vale - between the ileum and the large intestines - prevents backflow of waste Controlled by ileocecal sphincter Bile is secreted into the small intestine from the liver and pancreatic juice is secreted into the small intestine from the pancreas - bile emulsifies fat Into droplets to disperse in water pH of the small intestine is slightly basic to neutralize the chyme enzymes from the pancreas help complete the digestion process The surface area of the wall of the small intestine is approximately that of a tennis court due to fingerlike projections called villi and additional projections called microvilli this is for maximum absorption of nutrients into the cardiovascular (glucose and fatty acids) system and lymphatic (fats) system Regulation of digestive hormones: Although the nervous system plays a part in the secretion of digestive juices - so do hormones hormones - substance produced by one set of cells that affects a different set of cells Called target cells if one eats a meal rich in protein - stomach produces the hormone gastrin - enters the Bloodstream - soon the stomach begins churning,

release is stimulated by the HCI in the chyme And CCK - cholecystokinin - whose release is stimulated by partially Digested protein and fats Once \nthese hormones enter the bloodstream - the liver

rectum Rectum - last division of the large intestine Anus - lower opening of the gastrointestinal tract 2 anal sphincter muscles control the anus Defecation is the expulsion of feces - 3 quarters

main bacteria present in the large intestine --they break Down undigestive food and produce vitamins and other molecules the large Intestine absorbs polyps - colon can develop polyps - small growths arising from the epithelial lining - can be Benign or cancerous - are surgically removable researchers believe increased fat intake can lead to cancer because of the increase in Bile secretion caused by fat also - increase in fiber intake decreases the chances of colon cancer - fiber absorbs water and adds bulk - diluting the concentration of bile salts and facilitating the Movement of substances through the intestine Regular elimination decreases the intestines exposure to cancer promoting Agents diarrhea - caused by infections of the lower tract and nervous stimulation each case the intestinal wall is stimulated due to irritation or nervous stimulation Peristalsis increases and water is not absorbed - resulting in diarrhea constipation - feces are dry and hard - many times
