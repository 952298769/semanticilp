long with reddish transparent wings Attack, sting, and drag cicadas and large katydids into their burrows Lay an egg on the prey Resulting larva eats the insect Emerges as an adult the following year Damage Dig burrows with exit holes 1/4 - 1/2&quot; diameter in sandy and other soil Burrow opening is surrounded with a small amount of fine soil Large wasps are intimidating but unlikely to sting Males patrol aerial territories and confront anything entering the territory More intimidating than the females Unable to sting Commonly a problem on golf courses due to the fear instilled in golfers Ground-Nesting Bees and Wasps Identification Ground bees are various species Tend to be 1/4-1/2&quot; long with gray and black banding Each nest contains only a few bees Usually there are many nests in a small area Unlikely to sting Eastern Yellowjacket is 1/2&quot; long with black and yellow banding Commonly referred to mistakenly as a bee Nest in abandoned rodent burrows Nest builds to several thousand individuals by fall Very likely to sting if disturbed May sting without provocation Nests are started in the spring by overwintering, mated females Nests die out in the fall with young mated females overwintering Nests are not reoccupied although new nests may be built next to old nests Damage Large numbers of bees or wasps are intimidating to people using the turf Yellowjackets are ferocious stingers Stings can be fatal to susceptible people Earthworms Identification Elongate, brownish to reddish, without legs Tunnel through the soil - may come out onto the surface at night The nightcrawler, garden worm, and red worm are common in turf areas Feed on decaying plant material Come to the surface at night to feed and mate Leave castings - small piles of fecal material They are hermaphroditic with both sexes being present in each worm They lie head to tail to mate Reproductive organs are in the clitellum region Eggs are laid into a pod Damage Beneficial generally Aid in thatch removal and decomposition Aerate the soil with their burrows Enrich the soil with their feces Castings can be a nuisance May harm appearance of turf Can deflect golf ball on greens High sand content greens can result in dulling greens mower blades Overabundance causes problems Soil becomes spongy - making it difficult to mow or even walk across Turf surface becomes uneven with hills and valleys Soil may be so loose as to allow turf roots to dry out resulting in dieback Soil mass will consist of small balls with little cohesion Crayfish Identification Also called crawdads and land crabs Elongate, brownish to reddish with 10 legs First pair of legs are chela - pincers Two pairs of antennae End of tail broadened Larger species are 6-8&quot; as adults Breathe with gills that are at the base of the legs under the carapace Need to keep gills wet Can move long distances overland - particularly at night Omnivorous - feeding primarily on dead animals and plants Will feed on live turf and other plants Will eat fish, earthworms, and other small animals Female carries her jellylike eggs and newly hatch young on the underside of the abdomen Most species live only in streams and ponds Species that burrow in dry land also live in streams Damage Some crayfish species dig burrows into the soil, particularly in low-lying areas Construct a chimney around the burrow make of balls of mud Chimney tends to be the height of highest floodwater Burrow will extend down to the groundwater where the crayfish will live Crayfish burrows and their chimneys can cause people to trip Can also damage lawn mowers No labeled pesticides Pesticides applied to burrow can contaminate the groundwater Management Establish unmowed natural area such as wetland or mesic prairie area Tile area to provide better drainage",1.1197004318237305],["Collect the drainage and pour the water sample over the soil several more times.",1.1174967288970947],["Watering Watering requirements for lawns vary depending on soil, rainfall and type of grass.",1.1158699989318848],["(response) What does grass find in the soil, sunshine, water, and minerals that it finds in one place but not in another?",1.1149388551712036],["Blood, tissue, grass and soil samples are being examined.",1.1147769689559937],["Blood, tissue, grass and soil samples are being examined.",1.1147769689559937],["Blood, tissue, grass and soil samples are being examined.",1.1147769689559937],["They took soil samples to see if the grass was richer in that area;",1.1147769689559937],["by collecting a soil sample and testing it for the presence of water.",1.114278793334961],["Collect and analyze soil, water, and air samples.",1.114278793334961],["Soil and water samples will be collected and analyzed for pH.",1.114278793334961],["Croatian hydrogeologists collected water, soil, and dust samples;",1.114278793334961],["At the sites, soil and water samples were collected.",1.114278793334961],["At the sites, soil and water samples were collected .",1.114278793334961],["air, soil, water and waste sample collection;",1.114278793334961],["Here is Luz collecting soil water samples into a syringe.",1.114278793334961],["They collected hundreds of water, soil and vegetation samples.",1.114278793334961],["collecting and analyzing soil, water, and air samples;",1.114278793334961],["Austin - collecting and preparing soil, water and plant samples).",1.114278793334961],["The following are links to soil-teaching/tutorial websites: A Method for Studying the Effects of Soil Aggregate Size and Density Advanced Soil Chemistry Aggregate Stability The stability of different aggregate sizes The stabilizing effect of organic matter The dispersive effect of organic matter The role of humic substances The role of polysaccharides The role of iron and aluminum oxides The role of texture and cations References Application of Soil Survey and Classification Aridic Soils of the United States and Israel Basics of Soil Biodiversity, Soil and Ecologically Sustainable Development Bioengineering for Hillslope, Streambankand Lakeshore Erosion Control Bulk Density and Porosity Cation Exchange Capacity Composting Composts as a Soil Amendment Crystal Structure - Soil Mineralogy Deep Tillage of Saskatchewan Soils Determination of Aggregate Stability Emergency Wind Erosion Control FAO Soil Texture Classification Fertilization and Liming Forest Soil Garden Soil Management General Moisture Conservation Techniques Geology of Soils- Geo258 Class Megan Anderson: Soil Hydrology Under Fire David Barbeau: Arctic and Alpine Soils David Bitner: Impact of Campsites on the Soils of the BWCAW Josh Bookin: The Detrimental Effects of Soil Acidity on Tropical Agriculture Emily Burton: Feedback Effects of Soil Carbon Cycling in Northern Ecosystems Nathan Church: Effect of Organic Farming on Soil Nutrients and Structure Joe Colgan: Carbon Mineralization and Flux in Bog Soils and Global Climate Change Amy Converse: Problems and Management Possibilities of Lateritic Soils in the Tropics Angela Dickens: Organic Matter Decay in Soils Erik Ekdahl: Factors of Soil Aggregation Carrie Elliott: Soil Formation Under Desert Pavements Josh Feinberg: The Effects of the Green Revolution on the Punjabi Soils of India Dan Feiveson: Large Livestock and Formation and Weathering Patterns of Soils Claire Fellman: Clay and Pottery John Fiege: Soil Degradation and Desertification in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley Alison Gabel: Deforestation of the Tropical Rain Forest Soils of La Selva Cecilia Gonzalez: Composting and its Use as Soil Amendment Chris Jones: Forest Soils on Acid Elijah M.
