Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another. Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment. For example, animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall. Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects. In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and geese, travel south for the winter. They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food. They return north in the spring.
