waves per second that pass a fixed point Velocity: Speed with which the waves are moving past a fixed point Orbital motion The size of the orbit of the water particles increases with wavelength The orbit size decreases rapidly with depth Orbit size decreases to 1/23 of surface value at a depth equal to 1/2 of wavelength Only &quot;feel&quot; waves to a depth of 1/2 of their wavelength Classification of waves: according to the way they are formed or destroyed Major formation forces: Wind Atmospheric pressure Landslides or other earth movements Gravitational attraction =>Wind waves have the most energy in surface ocean Restoring forces : Try to flatten out the waves Surface tension for very small waves (&lt;0.6 inches) Gravity, for everything bigger Deep and shallow water waves
