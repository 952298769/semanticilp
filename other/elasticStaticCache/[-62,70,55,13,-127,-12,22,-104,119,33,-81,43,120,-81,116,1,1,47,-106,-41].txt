[["X1014295567-00189-44819</DOCNO> Untitled Cellular Reproduction Fission versus Division Before cell can divide, it must replicate its nucleic acids and assure that each daughter cell receives an equal compliment Procaryotic cells employ the process of fission Eucaryotic cells undergo a divisional process Procaryotic Fission Procaryotic cells have a less complex organization than eucaryotes Attain sufficient size to undergo binary fission Chromosome is attached to the cellular membrane The chromosomeis replicated New membrane and cell wall material is synthesized The two chromosomal attachment site grow apart Additional synthesis of cell wall and membrane separates the daughter cells Why Eucaryotic Chromosomes Pose Problems Eucaryotic chromosomes are linear (except for organelle DNA) Nuclear DNA is \nwound into nucleosomes Chromosomes are organized into loop structures Eucaryotic organisms are primarily diploid (Two copies of each chromosome which represents a homologous pair) Cellular Division Cellular division in eucaryotes involves the separation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic content Nuclear division of somatic cells results in two nuclei with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell is referred to as mitosis The division of the cytoplasm is called cytokinesis The Cell Cycle The time between cellular divisions is referred to as the cell cycle The cellular cycle is divided into a series of stages These stages are a series of continuous events by are designate by specific names to identify the gradation processes which are occurring during each each stage Stages of the Cell Cycle Interphase is the period between the division processes Interphase is subdivided into series of sub-phases G1 (Gap or Growth Phase 1) S ( Synthesis Phase) G2 (Gap 2 or Growth 2) M Phase is the divisional phase M Phase can occur in both somatic and germ cells (either mitosis or meiosis, respectively) Interphase G1 is the portion of interphase which immediately follows cellular division The cell conducts the processes of growth including resource acquistion, respiration, protein synthesis, ribosome synthesis and cellular differentiation Centrioles begin to replicate (animal cells) These are essential components of flagella and cillia S Phase is the segment of the cell cycle during which the chromosomes are replicated DNA replication specifically occurs during this time period Histone and non-histone protein that are associated with chromosomes are also synthesized G2 the cell is preparing for the divisional process that will immediately follow this stage Continued protein synthesis Oganization of the cellular machinery necessary for cytokinesis Regulation of the Cellular Cycle Passage between each of the various sub-phases of Interphase is tightly regulated Regulation is necessary to assure that the progeny cells will have all the necessary resources to continue the cell line The time require to complete a cell cycle (division to division) varies Plants in general require 10 - 30 hours Animals require between 18 - 24 hours Some cells can divide as quickly as 20 mins\\ Each stage of the cycle can also vary in time Control of Phase Transition Passage between interphase stages is not automatic Some cells become arrested in either G1 or G2 The arrest arises from the failure of the cell to produce chemical substances that signal the transition to the next phase The chemicals that control the cell cycle are cyclins S-cyclins stimulate DNA synthesis M-cyclins initiate mitosis Cyclins interact with cell-division-cycle (cdc) proteins to form a Maturation Promoting Factor M Phase Mitosis is a complex process which can be sub-divided into four stages Prophase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase Prophase Cell readies itself for separation of replicated chromosomes Chromosomes begin to condense Characteristic &quot;X-shaped&quot; appearance Mitotic spindle fibers become visable Cytoskeleton components Centrioles move apart and Aster appear Polar microtubules form Nuclear envelope disappears Metaphase Chromosomal bodies begin to align at the cellular equator Movement of the chromosomes is directed by the spindle fibers which are attached to the kinetochore Metaphase ends when the centromeres between the chromotids separate DNA content is the same but the number of chromosomes has temporarily doubled Anaphase During anaphase the two sets of chromosomes move toward opposite poles of the spindle apparatus The chromosomes are single chromatids at this point Movement is accomplished in two ways Digestion of the spindle fibers near the polar bodies Extension of the polar microtubules Telophase Telophase is essential the opposite of prophase Chromosomes have reached their respective poles Nuclear envelopes begin to surround the two sets of chromosomes Chromosome begin to decondense Cytokinesis is almost complete during this Cytokinesis Some organisms can undergo mitosis without cytokinesis producing coenocytic cell (fungi and algae) Animals cytokinesis begins with a cleavage furrow Location is at right angles to the spindle apparatus Cleavage furrow deepen until it cut the cells into two Plants produce a cell plate (new cell wall) between the two nuclei Making Gamates:Meiosis A divisional process that reduces the number of chromosomes in each new cell to half the normal number (Haploid) If sexual gamates had not undergone meiosis then the fertilized zygote would have twice the number of chromosomes as the parents Stages of Meiosis Meiosis is subdivided into a series of stages Prophase I Metaphase I Anaphase I Telophase I interkinesis Prophase I Prophase I in may superficially resemble prophase of mitosis Similar event occur (chromosomal condensation, spindle apparatus, nuclear envelope dissolution) Homologous chromosome pair through the formation of synaptonemal complex Allows for recombination (chiasmata) to occur Metaphase I During metaphase the paired homologous chromosomes move to the equatorial plate of the cell These paired chromosomes have four chromatids referred to as a tetrad Within a tetrad each chromosome typically consists of two hybrid chromatids Anaphase I Anaphase I of meiosis differs from that of mitosis In mitosis the two sister chromatids of a chromosome separate In meiosis the separation occurs between homologous chromosomes rather than between chromatids (no separation at the centromere) Telophase I and Interkinesis Telophase I is essentially the same as mitosis with the exception that each newly formed nucleus has half as many chromosomes as the parent cell .",1.5736867189407349],["Biofilm formation in typical oligotrophic environments (of which aquifers are representative) is a process: Pioneer cells, typically near starvation, find a somewhat advantageous environment on which to settle down, such as a new well borehole, where there is enough O2-tension to begin oxidative respiration (truly troublesome biofouling without oxidative respiration also is very rare).",1.413994312286377],["This ultimately results in damage to the part of the cell that provides energy to the cell by the respiration process.",1.4124215841293335],["Laboratory exercises examine the processes of cell growth and respiration, in addition to teaching techniques of subcellular fractionation, organelle analysis, and chromosome evaluation.",1.3193165063858032],["ATP is manufactured as a result of several cell processes including fermentation, respiration and photosynthesis.",1.2915832996368408],["X1011590744-00244-59541</DOCNO> Encyclopedia.com - Results for respiration respiration respiration , process by which an organism exchanges gases with its environment.",1.2482010126113892],["The respiration process results in the oxidation of the starch (a polymer of glucose) contained in the cells of the tuber, which converts it into water, carbon dioxide and heat energy.",1.2256284952163696],["The herbicide interferes with cell respiration, the process by which plants produce energy.",1.2083338499069214],["Cell respiration is the process by which consumers, detritus feeders and decomposers obtain energy.",1.2083338499069214],["The herbicide interferes with cell respiration, the process by which plants take in oxygen.",1.2083338499069214],["The oxygen is necessary for the physiological process of respiration, which provides energy for functioning cells.",1.2083338499069214]]
