break through the plasma and vitelline membrane surrounding the egg to prevent more than one sperm from penetrating the egg ( polyspermy ), the egg undergoes a cortical reaction to bring the sperm head into the interior of the egg and change the vitelline envelope to form the fertilization membrane Just after fertilization the zygote (fertilized egg) undergoes cleavage (mitotic cell divisions)

Meroblastic cleavage occurs more in macrolecithal eggs cleavage takes place only in a disk at the animal pole the cleavage furrows do not extend into the yolk results in the formation of the

around the developing embryo these membranes are called the amnion, chorion and allantois reptile, bird and mammal embryos form these membranes during embryogenesis these animals are collectively

cavities in the skull posterior and dorsally to eye socket reptiles are represented by two of these divisions - the anapsids - turtles the diapsids - snakes, lizards, crocodiles birds are also diapsids mammals have evolved from the synapsid lineage early amniotes were all amphibian/reptile-like in character egg shells the formation of extra-embryonic membranes probably followed or co-evolved with the ability to produce a thicker shell-like covering for the egg in early reptiles, the chorionic membrane was the shell the formation of a mineralized shell allowed the embryo to develop in a non-aqueous environment outside of the shell while maintaining an aqueous environment inside of the shell gas exchange occurs through the membranes (eventually what evolves into placenta)
