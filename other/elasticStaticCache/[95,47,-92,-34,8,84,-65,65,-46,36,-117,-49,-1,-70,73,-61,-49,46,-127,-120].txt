reflect more or less the same gene pool while the lack of gene flow between different species means that they remain different, without mixing together hypothetical bird example A single population: a population of finches live on an island the island has two areas, one wet and one dry selection favors large beaks in the dry area, and small beaks in the wet area but the finches fly all around the island and interbreed with each other so the birds all are members of a single population although more large-beaked birds survive in the dry area, and more small-beaked birds survive in the wet area, they all mate with each other at random and mix up all their genes in the next generation so the beaks in the next generation are an average, intermediate size the population average does not change, and all the birds remain roughly the same - a single species now imagine that a different species of bird also lives on the island it has a long, narrow beak and a long tongue suited for picking insects out of tree bark the two species of birds share the island, but do not mate with each other: they are reproductively isolated from each other no matter how useful it might be to have a long, narrow beak and tongue and eat insects, the finches will never get these traits from the bug-eating birds the gap between the two species remains clear the finches remain finches, and the bug-eaters remain bug-eaters because they are reproductively isolated from each other the point of the example according to the biological species concept, it is gene flow within the species that keeps all members of the species fairly similar and it is reproductive isolation from other species that allows each species to be different from all others, because no mixing between species occurs a note about reproductive isolation populations may be reproductively isolated in many different, often subtle ways in the most obvious case, they may be so different that they physically cannot mate, or that even if they do, the offspring do not survive or are not fertile but isolation is just as complete if they simply do not mate for some other reason for example, if one population is active in the day, and the other at night or if two populations of birds develop preferences for different colors of feathers, and the birds only choose mates of their own type even though they could be made to successfully mate in a lab or on a farm, if they do not mate in nature, they are effectively isolated The ecological species concept \"A species is a group of organisms that is genetically distinct from other species because any hybrids between species are markedly less successful\" This is a much less common, somewhat radical view but it is worth looking at The ecological species concept says that what keeps all the members of the species similar to each other is not gene flow, but rather stabilizing selection because the selective pressures that created the species in the first place will tend to keep each population the same (stabilizing selection) that is, even if a species is divided into physically isolated populations and there is no gene flow between them, the two populations will still remain the same because they are experiencing the same stabilizing selection pressures the species remain different from other species because if individuals from two different species do successfully mate and produce offspring the offspring will have a mixture of traits that will be less well adapted.",1.1073756217956543],["ecological or habitat isolation -- during speciation, species

often have important effects on the environment, so that the groups of populations experience different selection pressures e.g., a mountain chain creates a rainshadow the populations on the \"shadow\" side will experience drier conditions, which will influence not only them, but the other plants and animals in their communities that, in turn, will cause selection for a whole variety of different traits than those that will be favored on the wetter side of the mountain chain Over time, selection will cause the groups of populations to become increasingly different If the barrier persists long enough, and if sufficient change occurs in the two groups, they will no longer be able to interbreed even if populations come into contact - we say they are reproductively isolated , and they belong to two species instead of one Reproductive isolating mechanisms can take several forms - the forms can be divided according to whether they act to prevent mating and fertilization, or whether they act after fertilization has taken place: Pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms prevent mating/fertilization - they include: ecological isolation : populations occur in the same general area, but occupy different habitats, so individuals don't encounter each other to breed temporal isolation : populations occur in the same habitat, but are active at different times (e.g., one is nocturnal, one is diurnal), so individuals don't encounter each other to breed behavioral isolation : members of different species use different behaviors to identify themselves - so even if individuals encounter one another, they don't \"recognize\" each other as potential mates mechanical isolation : structural differences in genitalia or flower structure prevent males of one species from mating with/fertilizing females of another gametic isolation : even if mating takes place, sperm and egg are incompatible and fertilization doesn't take place Post-zygotic isolation : the development of fertile, viable adults is prevented because of genetic incompatibility hybrid inviability : hybrid zygotes don't develop or don't reach sexual maturity hybrid sterility : hybrids fail to produce gametes (e.g., mules) hybrid breakdown : first-generation hybrids are viable and fertile, but their offspring are not A special case of geographic speciation is adaptive radiation adaptive radiation is the very rapid diversification of new species from a single ancestor adaptive radiations typically occur when one of two things happens: a founder population colonizes a new habitat with abundant resources and no competitors - e.g., a new island as members of the population begin to exploit different sets of resources, they experience different selection pressures and diverge e.g., Darwin's finches on the Galapagos;",1.0281777381896973],["Females of some species mate with just one male, but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males.",1.0267800092697144],["The
