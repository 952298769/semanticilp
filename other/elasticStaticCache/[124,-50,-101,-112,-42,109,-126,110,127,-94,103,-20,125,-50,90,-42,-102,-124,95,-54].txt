continental-sized Ice shelves - mass of (Note: loss of ice sheets would raise sea level ) General glacier classification based on relative T - controls Temperate (wet) glacier - at the higher pressure of the base of the glacier the temperature characterized by a Polar (dry, cold) glacier - at the higher pressures of the base of the glacier characterized by a Glaciers form from: Conversion of snow to glacial ice - glaciers are with burial, snow - Change in glacier size - Glacial Budget: matter of mass balance - if accumulation exceeds ablation generally activity at the terminus calving forms Glacial Movement Ice moves and carries objects by Maximum velocities at the Typical rates of movement is a Glacier surge - unusually Glaciation - the modification of the land surface by Glacial
