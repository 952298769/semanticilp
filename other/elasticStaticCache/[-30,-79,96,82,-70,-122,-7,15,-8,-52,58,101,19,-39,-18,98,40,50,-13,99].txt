predators, changing food supplies, etc. acts more or less equally on males and females but sexual selection acts primarily on the one sex that is competing for the other as we have seen, because of pregnancy and lactation, mammal females can have only a limited number of offspring, but males have no such limitations females can generally only conceive when they aren't pregnant or lactating, and even then only during a limited portion of their cycle males can mate any time so there are generally plenty of males around to mate when a female needs to but the males have to compete for access to those limited chances to father offspring so selection will favor any feature of the males that increases their success at mating with receptive females we tend to think of survival to adulthood as being the biggest factor in natural selection, hence the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" but in fact, sexual selection can exert a much stronger evolutionary effect than selection based on different rates of survival males who do not succeed at mating frequently may produce absolutely no offspring this means absolutely none of their genes go into the next generation -- very severe selection from an evolutionary point of view, leaving no offspring is equivalent to dying in infancy this is a common occurrence meanwhile, males who mate often may produce many, many offspring very rapidly increasing the representation of their traits in the next generation being successful at mating and having a large number of offspring has a far greater effect that just surviving and having an average number of offspring example: imagine a species in which 80% of the males produce no offspring, and the remaining 20% father the entire next generation these are realistic figures for many animals, from lions to baboons the effect of this difference in just one generation would be equivalent to a drought that killed off 8 out of 10 individuals that is, ordinary, common degrees of selection on sexual success have as much effect on the next generation as the most drastic, rare extremes of selection that affect survival the same is true even if many males leave just a few offspring, while a few males leave large numbers of offspring the contribution to the next generation by the father of 12 is bigger than that of ten fathers of one child each... so the traits that lead males to have many children are strongly selected for Point: the process that has the strongest, most consistent effect on evolution is not \"survival of the fittest\", but \"mating of the sexiest\" because sexual selection is so strong, it can favor traits that have significant costs for survival even if fewer of the individuals who have the trait survive, they produce so many more offspring than those without it that the trait is favored anyway classic example of sexual selection: peacock tails (on males) the showier the tail, the more successful the male is at mating the tails have gotten so big that they make it hard for the males to hide or get away from predators but the benefit in terms of success in mating outweighs the cost to survival intrasexual selection (male-male competition) in primates males try to keep other males away from females this ensures that they are the likely fathers of any offspring this results in hostile encounters or fights so sexual selection favors large body size, large canines, possibly other traits that help one male defeat another for access to females but females would not benefit as much from larger body size, canines, etc. they would just have to eat even more to maintain a large body when food is already their limiting factor in reproductive success since selection favors larger males but smaller females, eventually sexual dimorphism arises differences between males and females sure enough, those species with the greatest male-male competition have the greatest sexual dimorphism male-male competition is assumed to be greatest in species whose social groups have the greatest imbalance of females to males because if there are relatively few males in the group, mating with the many females, then there must be lots of males excluded from the group who are not mating at all these bachelor males must be constantly driven away by the few males in the group the evidence: in monogamous species there is very little male-male competition, since each male is paired with one female and indeed, monogamous species have almost no sexual dimorphism gibbons and siamangs are a classic examples;",0.9159545302391052],["Why

conducted on one of the Galapagos islands, Daphne Major, in the Pacific far off the coast of Ecuador The birds are medium ground finches ( Geospiza fortis ), which mostly eat seeds The Grants' project captured, banded, and recorded measurements and other information about all the birds on the island over a number of years, and also recorded other information about the environment, especially the availability of different kinds of seeds Early in the study, the island received a lot of rain, but then is suffered a severe drought, which drastically affected the availability of the seeds that the birds ate This provided a great opportunity to watch natural selection in action During the drought, the plants on the island produced many fewer of the small, soft varieties of seeds that the finches prefer The finches quickly ate most of the small, soft types of seeds This left mostly larger, harder seeds, which many of the birds found difficult to eat The drought made it obvious that Darwin's first postulate was being met: more birds were born than survived long enough to reporoduce The food shortage caused many birds to starve to death The finch population declined from 1200 birds to 180 birds in just two years of drought This was obviously a severe case, but not anything unusual in the real world The Grants' measurements showed that there was variation in the depth (height) of the finches beaks there was a normal, smooth distribution of beak depths, ranging from relatively shallow beaks to relatively deep ones and they observed that birds with different beak depths preferred different kinds of seeds birds with shallow beaks preferred smaller, softer seeds presumably because their beaks were not strong enough to break into the larger, harder seeds birds with deeper beaks preferred larger, harder seeds presumably because there were more of them around, and these birds were able to crack them with their stronger (deeper) beaks They might also have preferred the larger seeds because they have more food content per seed So, the variation in beak depth caused a variation in fitness when small seeds were scarce birds with shallow beaks had trouble finding enough food birds with deeper beaks were more likely to find enough food so birds with deeper beaks were more likely to survive during the drought That is, Darwin's second postulate was also being met: the birds varied in how well suited they were to find food during the drought This is illustrated by figure 1.9 in the text Fig 1.9a shows that the deeper the beak, the more likely the bird was to survive during the drought years Fig 1.9b shows the distribution of beak depths during the early, wet years, and the distribution of beak depths after a year of drought more of the birds with shallow beaks have died off, leaving a population with relatively more deep-beaked birds that is, the average beak depth increased Finally, the Grants compared the beak depths of birds and their offspring, and found that beak depth was inherited: Darwin's third postulate, that offspring tend to resemble their parents, was also working in nature They showed that shallow-beaked birds tended to produce shallow-beaked offspring, and deep-beaked birds tended to produce deep-beaked offspring This is no surprise, of course but it is absolutely necessary for the theory to work otherwise, the offspring would not reflect the traits that had been selected for in the parents So, after two years of drought, the new generation of finches being hatched had beaks that averaged deeper than the chicks of just two years earlier In two years, the average beak depth increased by 4% This is evolution caught in the act And not even the slow, gradual evolution we usually think of Imagine what would happen
