Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Unique Character of Fungi fig 32.1 Studied by mycologists Traditionally classified as plants Unlike plants due to lack of chlorophyll Like plants due to immobility and linear growth form Fungi are filamentous, plants are three dimensional Composition of cell walls differs Plants photosynthesize, fungi absorb food after secretion of enzymes and extracellular digestion Some plants have flagellated sperm while fungi do not Economic Value of Fungi Many are harmful Cause decay, rot and spoilage Cause serious plant and animal diseases Many are beneficial Yeasts are used in the manufacture of bread and beer Used to flavor cheese, wine and other foods Industrial production of acids, antibiotics and chemical syntheses Detoxify environment NUTRITION AND ECOLOGY Fungi and Bacteria Are the Principle Decomposers in Every Ecosystem Break down lignin, a major part of wood Provide building blocks for growth of other organisms Some fungi attack still living organic matter Cause agricultural damage Destroy food stores making them unpalatable or poisonous Important Mutualistic Associations Lichens = fungi + green algae or cyanobacteria Mycorrhizae = fungi + plant roots fig 32.2 Photosynthetic partner fixes carbon dioxide and provides food Fungal portion enhances existence within a particular habitat Mycorrhizae facilitate absorption of essential nutrients by plant roots STRUCTURE Filamentous Growth Form Slender filaments called hyphae May be divided into cells by septa Barrier incomplete except when separating reproductive cells Cytoplasm flows freely through pores in septa fig 32.3 Results in rapid growth with optimum food, water and temperature Mass of hyphae called mycelium fig 32.4 If strung end-to-end would be many meters long Surrounds and penetrates substrate All parts are metabolically active and interact with environment Rapid growth conspicuous if visible reproductive structures formed Evidence of Unique Evolution that Is Not Related to Plants or Animals Composition of cell wall Polysaccharide plus chitin (not cellulose) Same component of arthropod exoskeleton More resistant to bacterial degradation Distinctive form of mitosis Nuclear envelope remains intact Spindle apparatus forms within nuclear envelope Lack centrioles Microtubule formation regulated by spindle plaques REPRODUCTION Fungal Genetic Status All nuclei haploid except for zygote nuclei Sexual reproduction in two of the three phyla Hyphae of two different mating strains meet and fuse Two types of nuclei coexist without fusion for most of the life of the fungus Important terminology Heterokaryotic hyphae have two kinds of genetically different nuclei Homokaryotic hyphae have genetically similar nuclei Dikaryotic compartment has two genetically distinct nuclei Monokaryotic compartment has a single nucleus Dikaryotic hypha is always heterokaryotic Monokaryotic hypha is always homokaryotic Dikaryotic hyphae have some properties of diploids, both genomes transcribed Types of Reproductive Structures Cytoplasm flows freely if no septa, or through perforations in septa Sporangia: involved in spore formation Gametangia: structures in which gametes are formed Conidia: multinucleate asexual spores not produced in sporangia Spores are always non-motile Distribution via wind, over great distances Dispersed by insects, small animals FUNGAL PHYLA Historical Aspects of Classification Plant-like, thus grouping was called division, now phylum is preferred Presently differentiated from protist slime molds and water molds Characteristics of oomycetes (water molds) Motile spores Cellulose-rich cell walls Regular patterns of mitosis Diploid hyphae Differentiation of phyla by sexual reproductive structures Zygomycetes Hyphal fusion results in formation of zygote Zygote undergoes meiosis at germination Ascomycetes and basidiomycetes Distinctive reproductive cells formed from dikaryotic hyphae Meiosis immediately follows syngamy, nuclear fusion Produces haploid spores Phylum Zygomycota Nonreproductive hyphae lack septa Include common bread molds fig 32.1c Produce characteristic zygospores, temporarily dormant structures Typical life cycle \nand sexual reproduction fig 32.5 Sexual reproduction via fusion of multinucleate gametangia Gametangium cut off from hypha by complete septum May occur between same or different mating types Nuclei of different mating types fuse immediately Massive, haploid zygospore forms around diploid zygote nuclei Zygospore may contain one or more zygotes Meiosis occurs during germination All nuclei are haploid except for zygote nuclei Asexual reproduction is common Haploid spores produced within sporangia Sporangium forms at tip of erect hypha, with separating septum Spores shed above substrate, dispersed by wind Phylum Ascomycota Beneficial forms include yeast, molds, morels and truffles fig 32.1a,6 Harmful forms include chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease fig 32.7 Characteristic reproductive structure called ascus Diploid zygote formed within haploid ascus fig 32.8 Asci form on ascocarp of densely interwoven hyphae fig 32.1a,6 Asexual reproduction is common Conidia are produced at ends of conidiophores fig 32.14 Spores separated from hyphae by septa Hyphae are septate, but septae are perforated and cytoplasm flows through them Septae at reproductive structures are initially perforated but are sealed later Multinucleate hyphae may be homokaryotic or heterokaryotic Multinucleate gametangia are specialized hyphae Ascogonia are female, have trichogyne outgrowth Antheridia are male and fuse with trichogyne Male nuclei travel to ascogonium to pair with opposite nuclei Heterokaryotic, dikaryotic hyphae arise from area of fusion An ascus containing two nuclei forms at hyphal tip Nuclei fuse forming diploid zygote, immediately undergoes meiosis Four haploid daughter nuclei formed Daughter nuclei divide by mitosis forming eight ascospores fig 32.9 Ascocarps contain monokaryotic and dikaryotic hyphae fig 32.1a,6 May be open as in cup fungi and morels May be closed or have only small opening Yeasts Unicellular, mostly ascomycetes fig 32.10 Most reproduction is asexual cell fission or budding Fusion of two cells results in ascus, undergoes sexual reproduction Diverse degenerate fungi derived from filamentous forms Yeasts related only by being single-celled Most are ascomycetes, but other two groups are represented Even ascomycetes are not clearly related to one another Ferment carbohydrates, produce carbon dioxide and ethanol Important future in genetic engineering Other ascomycetes Most frequent kind of fungus found in lichens Judged by asexual structures, may include many Fungi Imperfecti Phylum Basidiomycota Include mushrooms, jelly fungi, puffballs, rusts and smuts fig 32.11 Include edible and poisonous varieties Characteristic reproductive structure called a basidium Syngamy occurs within
