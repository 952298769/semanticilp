waves to a depth of 1/2 of their wavelength Classification of waves: according to the way they are formed or destroyed Major formation forces: Wind Atmospheric pressure Landslides or other earth movements Gravitational attraction =>Wind waves have the most energy in surface ocean Restoring forces : Try to flatten out the waves Surface tension for very small waves (&lt;0.6 inches) Gravity, for everything bigger Deep and shallow water waves Relationship between wavelength and water depth determines wave characteristics Deep water wave: water depth &gt;1/2 wavelength orbits die away above bottom Shallow water wave: water depth &lt;1/20 wavelength orbits are flattened at the bottom Transitional wave: water depth &gt;1/20 but &lt;1/2 wavelength Wave &quot;feels&quot; bottom Gravity and seismic waves have very long wavelengths are always shallow water waves regardless of ocean depth Wave velocity Deep water waves Velocity of wave energy through water determined by wavelength Longer waves move faster Use period as is easier to measure than length Speed (m/sec) = 1.56 x wave period Typical 8 second trade wind wave moves at 12.4 m/sec=28 mph Shallow water waves Velocity of wave is related to water depth Speed (m/sec) = 3.1 x square root (depth) Typical 20 minute seismic wave moves at 470 mph When a deep water wave moves into shallow water it slows down Trade wind wave (8 second) 28 mph in deep water in 1 metre deep water speed is 3.1 m/sec=7 mph Wind wave formation Wind attempts to &quot;stretch&quot; surface skin of ocean Surface tension: capillary wave Wind deflected upwards, adds energy to wave pushes it forward Low pressure behind wave contributes to forward motion Continued wind, wave period and height grow together Waves are peaked in areas of formation, rounded swell away from formation regions Wave progression Longest waves move away from storm fastest Form wave trains Leading waves &quot;excite&quot; still water ahead of wave train New waves forms behind wave train Wave train travels at half the speed of the individual waves within it Maximum development of wind waves is the result of 3 factors: Wind strength Wind duration Uninterrupted ength of ocean that wind blows over (Fetch The stronger the wind the longer the duration and fetch needed to fully develop the sea Rarely get fully developed seas for strongest winds Highest waves found around Antarctica, constant wind, uninterrupted ocean Wave steepness and dispersal from a storm Maximum wave height in open ocean is 1/7 of wavelength, higher waves get whitecaps In region of formation seas chaotic Waves sorted by wavelength and speed as move away from formation region Waves turn to swell as they move away from region of formation height to length ratio gets smaller When waves overtake each other constructive interference causes very large waves Distant observer see longest and fastest waves first Surf prediction See Pat Caldwell's predictions Example: Fall 95 storm ~ 1,000 miles from Oahu Get meteorological and oceanic data from weather buoys in region Storm pressure 964 mbar, winds 50 knots, fetch 1200-1500 miles, duration only 24 hrs, not enough for a fully developed sea Swell 30 ft, period 12 seconds Wave velocity = 40 mph, group velocity = 20 mph Travel time to Oahu ~ 2days Wave height attenuation 30%/day After 1 day wave height 2/3 x 30 = 20ft After 2 days wave height 2/3 x 20 = 12ft Shoaling effect 2 x at Waianae = 24ft 1.2 x at Makaha = 14ft 1.6 x at Sunset Beach = 19ft Waves approaching the shore As wave train approaches shore &quot;feels&quot; bottom at depth = 1/2 wavelength Wave energy packed into shallower depth, becomes peaked Wave slows, period is constant, wavelength decreases Bottom of wave slows even more as gets shallower, wave crest moves ahead of base of wave Wave breaks when wave height to water depth ~ 3:4 Types of wave breaks Type of wavebreak depends on bottom Plunging waves from steeply sloping bottoms Spilling wave from gentle slopes Abrupt slope change: water surges on to beach Wave refraction Wave approaching coast at an angle End of wave entering shallow water slows down, rest of wave continues at full speed Wave bends towards shore (towards the slowest end) Wave diffraction Waves passing through a small gap diffract New waves reform at a point in gap and radiate out Occurs in harbour entrances and between islands Radiated waves between island groups form interference patterns Polynesian navigators recognised interference patterns to indicate island chains beyond the horizon Internal waves There are waves below surface at regions of density gradient, e.g. pycnocline Waves can be large but travel slowly as density gradient is small compared with one at sea surface Sub surface Kelvin waves bring an end to El Nino",0.921360433101654],["Classification There are several classifications of ocean waves, with each having distinct characteristics.",0.8721665143966675],["Therefore, an origin scheme based on change in tariff classification must be supplemented by a list of exceptions that describe when a sufficient transformation has occurred despite the lack of a change in tariff classification, [53] when a change in classification is not sufficient, [54] and which processes are not sufficient to confer origin even though they lead to a change in tariff classification.",0.8584335446357727]]
