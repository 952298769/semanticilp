To begin, we note that environments have a probability of moving into states that are undesirable for a creature. See figure 2. These states vary from the manageable but difficult, to the impossible. In a world designed to make life easy for a creature they would not arise at all. But inevitably they do arise because often they are side effects of the very actions taken by the creature. Thus eating leads to digestion leads to defecation which leads to soiling one's immediate locale. Unless, of course, the odious result is buried, as domestic cats do, or the creature leaves the immediate locale to defecate, as most creatures do their nests. Related actions are taking the garbage out of the burrow. Squirrels are known to remove rotting vegetation from their burrows, and occasionally the empty shells of their nuts. Undesirable states also arise because of exogenous factors. Winter snows bury nuts that otherwise could be counted on to be found. Other animals gather and consume nuts. The net result is that in wintertime the probability of finding a nut just in time is too low to be relied on. It is better to pay the storage costs and the up front labor costs to build an in house inventory.
