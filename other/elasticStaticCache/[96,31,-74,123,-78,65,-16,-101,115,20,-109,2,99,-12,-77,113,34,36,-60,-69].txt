ground Surfaces underlain by permafrost take a long time to recover after disturbance Depth of permafrost has no influence on the vegetation since the growth of plants depends only on the thickness of

the forests of northern Russia and Scandinavia Typical where the climate is too cold for most deciduous species (except for aspens, alders, and birches) Dominated by spruces, firs, and larches, and some pines (e.g., Scotch pine) Characterized by dense stands of relatively small trees that are typically under 30 m high Among the most economically important biomes as they are a source of lumber and pulp Temperate forests Occur in climate slightly warmer than those of the boreal forest Found throughout North America, southern South America, Europe, Asia, and Japan Common species are maples, beeches, oaks, and hickories (typically taller than boreal species) Among the biomes most changed by humans because they occur in regions long dominated by civilization Temperate rain forests Occur under moderate temperature regimes where the rainfall exceeds 250 cm yr-1 The \"giant forests\" Include the redwoods, western red cedar, and Douglas-fir Highest biomass of any forests Trees are taller than 70 m (230 ft) and are long-lived (more than 400 yrs for Douglas fir) Occur in Oregon, Washington, western Canada, Alaska, and western New Zealand Temperate woodlands Temperate temperature regimes but slightly drier climates than that of temperate deciduous forests Dominated by small trees such as pinyon pines Open stands Fires are a common disturbance and the species are fire adapted Temperate shrublands Drier climate than temperate woodlands Chaparral is a distinctive feature of this biome Dense stands of shrubs that rarely exceed a few meters in height Occur in Mediterranean climates - low rainfall that is concentrated in the cool season Found along coast of California, Chile, South Africa, and the Mediterranean Fire adapted Rarely more than 50 yrs old Temperate grasslands Occur in regions too dry for forests and too wet for deserts in regions with a continental climate (cold winters and hot summers) Precipitation (generally 40-60 cm yr-1) is seasonal Extreme lows of -40 oC, extreme highs of +40 oC Pronounced moisture deficit in the summer Periodic droughts common Include the North American prairies, the steppes of Eurasia, the plains of eastern South Africa, and the
