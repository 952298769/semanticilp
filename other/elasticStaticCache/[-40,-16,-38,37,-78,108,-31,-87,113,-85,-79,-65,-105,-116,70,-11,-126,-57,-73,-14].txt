Wide varieties of birds migrate south for the winter months and then return for summer months. Many mammals hibernate during the cold winter months when food is in short supply. Another adaptation some animals have is food storage. Like squirrels, chipmunks, and some jays store seeds and nuts in hollow trees during the summer month when the food is plentiful.

These means the temperature in these types of forests gets cold in the winter time (northern latitudes) Adaptations for living organisms: 1) Hibernation (sleep in dens ex. bears) 2) Migration (birds fly south for winter) 3) Winter Coats (rabbits & squirrels grow thick fur to stay warm) 4) Large Root System ( shorter growing period for plants & they need to maximize water collection) 5) Early Seed Production & Release - lots of trees & plants generate seeds during June so they can find soil, take hold, & start to grow before winter comes",1.786287784576416],["Passage 2 Unlike many birds, most bat species in the northern and central parts of the United States don't fly south for the winter. Instead of migrating, many bat species go into hibernation. Hibernation is usually a safe way to pass the cold winter. However, if their deep sleep is disturbed too often, the bats may die. People visiting bat caves sometimes force hibernating bats to wake up. When the bats wake up, they use up their stored fat too quickly. For example, each time a little brown bat wakes up, it consumes stored fat that would have lasted for 67 days of deep sleep. And because few insects live in the caves during the winter, the bats cannot build up fat reserves during the winter.",1.7814438343048096],["While many bear species do go into a physiological state often colloquially called \"hibernation\" or \"winter sleep\", it is not true hibernation.",1.7582974433898926],["In late November the Swimming Ducks disappeared, signalling the time for birds to fly south and hibernation to begin.",1.6897205114364624],["Animals have many different types of winter survival strategies.
