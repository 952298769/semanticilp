Student should complete the Erosion Control Practices activity sheet, or use it as a transparency for discussion.3. Discuss the various methods and why they are used.4. Answers: 1) streambank erosion, 2) gully erosion, 3) wind erosion, 4) rill erosion, 5) sheet erosion.Discussion1. What did you observe? How did the soil particles move from the center of the target? (they were picked up and moved with the water)2. Which zone contained the most number of water drops with soil particles? Why?3. Which zone contained the least number? Why?4. What would happen if the drops were larger? (splashes would travel further)5. How might you prevent splash erosion? (plant vegetation, cover the soil with mulch)6. How do farmers decide which erosion control methods to use? (it depends on the slope, soil types, and what he or she wants to plant)Background Erosion is a naturally occurring process. Erosion has given us some of our most beauti-ful landscapes. There are beautiful erosion formations such as the Grand Canyon, KolobCanyon (Zion National Park) the San Rafael Swell (Emery County) or Bryce Canyon, toname a few. Erosion is the loosening, transportation and relocation of soil particles fromone place to another. Erosion occurs primarily due to the action of wind and water. Therate and extent of erosion are determined by soil type and condition, slope of the land,plant cover, land use and climate. Erosion does not occur only on wilderness landscapes, and the effects are not alwayspositive, especially when you are talking about productive topsoil. Landslides, can burytowns and claim thousands of lives. Streams or rivers loaded with eroded soil can turnsources of clean drinking water into major health hazards. Water erosion includes raindrop splash, sheet erosion, rill erosion, gully erosion, andslumping or mass erosion. Raindrop splash is the most obvious on bare ground during atorrential rainstorm. The raindrops strike the ground and upon impact break soil particlesapart, splashing these particles into the air. The impact of raindrops can be lessened byplant cover. Plants break the fall of the raindrops and allow for water infiltration or percola-tion. Sheet erosion is the washing away of a thin surface layer of soil over a large area of land.Because sheet erosion occurs evenly, it is generally not obvious until most of the topsoil isremoved. Rill erosion may be noticeable on sloping bare ground after a rainstorm. Water formssmall, well defined channels that carry soil away from the sides and bottom of these chan-nels. The rills of channels erode more soil as they move downslope and increase in size.47 Utah Agriculture in the Classroom",0.8822581768035889],["This non-involvement of beneficiaries has after all been a cause of a significant erosion in the effectiveness with which EU funds have been applied.",0.8586201667785645]]
