kneecap to kneecap with the mountain desert hoarding mountains morning mountain top my shadow crosses Death Valley jagged mountain peaks sharpening my pencil for another scribble snow mountain lake desert river damned LA toasters toast toast noon sky red rock mountains jut into blue tunnel through the mountain's heart headlights mountain echo ages waiting for its return desert mountains all four seasons melt into one desert mountain all four directions meet in one stone mountain a gravel road winds down the slim edge mountain pass mountain pass the setting sun meets the moon writing on mountain peaks tablets of stone summit warmth wrapped around by mountains between mountains desert night wind on a full breast mountain peaks watching a million years pass by dizzy wobbly line of mountains at the summit mountain top silence slammed by a car door mountain stream mountain stream bell tones of rocks barely wet oasis summer at the oasis evening cool ocean dawn seas the ebbing light leaves shell pink ocean waves tide sends winds home to the ridge sea foam blowing from a wild surf gulls given depth by a passing cloud ocean colors ocean wild no need to see a whale summer day the ocean invents aquamarine holding hands a blazing log -and ocean roar squirting water between old rocks the ocean plays with itself pebble mighty river a white line through this pebble pond torchlight inviting rocks by the pond to dance on water green round pond lily pads of late summer mossy pennies summer departs the stagnant pond stays right here reef alone in the storm anchored to a rocky reef clang of a buoy bell river narrow river opening just a crack the wide ocean white with foam the ocean enters the river's mouth reservoir an ancient river refilled river days a stream of light flows by river mouth bridged by gulls redwood roots the river's course bends and twists deep below running in the sea other rivers rushing river brushes the air with white ripples walking the mountains the river goes along with us mid-morning the river refreshes itself with a little breeze the earth turns now and then the river bends hot sun presses water into a river summer flood from the river winding up the river a stream of cool air sleeping valley river sounds dream sleeping below the noisy river the other one stopping by the river sunlight a bank of fog rocky stream a dropped feather dyes it blue riverbed dry riverbed covered in the mornings with puffy clouds resting the river in its bed streambed bent to fit the earth a fallen willow rocks face to face with ancient rocks the tourist touches hers sea spray a rock drawn in the air its water shape mountain boulders breaking up the light desert rocks listening to the music of water monoliths holding the rosy sun against blue night broken rock half hot half cold rocks legends in sand rocks leaving clearly sand rocks in veins of ore roots magnetic lines in the rock writing it down evening reflected by glowing granite lighted from within rocks at the foot of the bed waves splash water falls on Japanese landscapes sea rocks a crack in the monolith one star the top of the rock in the bottom of the pool bright with sun cracking a smile faces in sandstone slanted sun splashing each other centuries in the surf brother rocks after the rain all the desert colors in wet rocks red rock walls echo blue rock walls forces of nature a sense of theater with rocks mountain peak stars burned into rocks glitter all day high tide lapping the fire in a rock salt flats road to the moon between ash meadows salt ponds reflected on the moon salt flats Death Valley salts a bright blue lake at twilight earth fissures lacing the pond dried salt the line between water and hills a salt sea desert beach green moss white with salts lining the hills edges of the sea with salt sand rolling over into dry sand the 7th wave snow-capped peaks then the wave spreads over a sandy beach sea dark and growling from land a summer storm becomes a glass sea lying low before storm clouds a smooth sea distant horizon sea miles marked by different colors water drawing a straight line between sea and sky splashes return to the sea a dance sea stacks sea stacks the white smoke of spindrift sky country two crows land with sun on their backs sky country spindrift undercurrents below spindrift a mellow flute spindrift above the ocean wave a prayer flag spindrift a cloud hangs where a wave broke stones night fall yet not one stone moves painting stones a mountain brook moving tree shadows alluvial fans the valley heat on stone fields shimmering above the hot stones summer sea one stone climbing the mountain in my shoe covered with stones the stream makes a path to the river streets/roads/paths fire in the mist rushing down the highway far mountains mountain path the roundness of the earth arches between my feet poem maps under summer feet paths midnight car lining the coast with highway one headlights on a rain-drenched pass slanted sunlight yellow line on a black highway last sun rays desert highway the poet writes a haiku on the yellow line mountains twisting roads in us following the river following the sun through mountains rivers building roads in mountains desert paths the smell of water paving the way without moving \nour road goes from town to town changing its name a summer shower the asphalt road rising in steam beach road summer smooth from sandy feet a mountain bends in the road heaped high mountain road going and going and yet time stands still freeway a truckload of art passing tanks dust the road disappears in itself road winding around the mountain mountain views down from the pass still the black road wiggles stream in the stream waiting for wind ripples to move the mountain this beach stream hangs our sandals on two fingers runs to the sea surf an open window surf sounds square night surf the bright waves of flame surf's boom sun beats into water sound on metal earth spins surf sounds in dry sand boiling seas into a wild surf a hot sun swamp black cypress draining into the swamp strands of color tides home again a pulse of tides in our blood tilted this side of the ocean dries in the sun dry rocks bubbling up between the incoming tide incoming tide the sun-dried rock wetted rattle of rocks at high tide the stars an earthly tone night tide black rocks blacker as a dark moon freshly washed hair receding tide leaves wet rocks high and low tides weaving sand the tide turns a whoosh of wave splashes white pictures in the burning wood tide lines rippling light night tide flows back to a sunlit sea high tide sharing a small beach with wet feet tide pool melting in a tide pool sun on still waters tremors deep in the earth tremors in our knees magnified after tremors in the fear and trembling frog voices valley rocks crumble into valleys evening colors deepening the lowest point in USA night shadow jagged mountains the wide slope of valley smoothes the air mountain shadows tracing valley contours across the sky layers of color the cliff eases into valleys blue dusk San Joaquin valley: sand walking valley after all my years Queen Valley* mother earth full of gold * a mining area in Death Valley empty night sky fills the desert valley with city lights the breaking wave cough drop colored cool mint between rainclouds sunlight slants deep into valleys mountain greatness the gentle easing into valleys rainclouds blowing into the valley sunset's golden light village bell tones of the country side village names volcano evenings setting the sky on fire lava mountains red into black summit passes into sunset mid-day heat of volcanoes still in the rocks lava rocks flowing with the river night-long shadows lava rocks flowing with the river dry summer heat black lava pushing into bloodred sunset peaks waves sunshine the tops of waves melting into hard metal sun in front of each crested wave its own radiance night air breathing deeply the waves wet dry sand walls of water waves in rock a tearing sound waves crash in the curve of the bay unbroken by man wave upon wave sun beats the water into a hard curve earth turning a wave rounds the blue green elephant rock stomping on the beach ocean waves asleep yet waves remember to come ashore a wave breaks out in laughter two people waves unrolling seafoam mounting up a wave rides a rock ashore rolling in waves the white foam clouds thunder solid waves flowing into the surf dunes arching into the sky the wave takes on more blue teary eyes seeing with binoculars salt waves white laced waves tearing silk across the sand each wave curves upward catches a gleam of sunlight then moves on seas of silk shapes without scissors waves torn asunder waves feeling time waterfall a woman a step down a waterfall taking to the waterfall the everyday worries washed away mountain waterfall fog flows backwards into clouds breath of angels air of waterfalls up one's nose foot of the falls tourists
