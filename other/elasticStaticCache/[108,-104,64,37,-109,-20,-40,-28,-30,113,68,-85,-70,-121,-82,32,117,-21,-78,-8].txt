expanded in recent years with the re-emergence of the illusive Iguana Delicatissima The Island's appointed custodian of its Marine, fauna, flora, and historical heritgage, the Anguilla National Trust, has spearheaded a thrust to ensure the the propogation of the Iguana The stamp issue endorced by the \"World Wildlife Fund for Nature\" (WWF) depicts the Iguana Delicatissima in four environment settings and the artist's interpretation of the subject is strikingly realistic Iguanas are large herbivore reptiles whch live largely in the dry forest throughout the West Indies and are virtually harmless to humans Iguanas were historically abundant on every island from Anguilla to Martinique As a result of these pressumes, the Lesser Antillean Iguanas are threatened with extinction across their range and many islands such as St Kitts, Nevis and Antigua no longer have Iguanas On Anguilla the small Iguana population inhabits a relatively small section of the northern coast and live in rock crevices To enhance the chances for juvenile survival, the Anguilla National Trust is considering captive breeding of the Iguana Delicatissima, a move which would significantly help to ensure the

By Edward M The (giant) green iguana is an arboreal (tree living), diurnal (daytime active), lizard that is found in Central and South America With proper care iguanas can live for up to 15 years and grow to a total body length of 6 feet Often times potential iguana owners visit their local pet store to purchase a cute little baby iguana only to find out that when it reaches its full adult size that it has become too much reptile to handle or house For this reason it is important to be sure that before purchasing a green iguana that you are prepared to care for and house this animal for the rest of its life The single most important factor in keeping a healthy iguana is to start off by selecting a healthy iguana from the beginning A healthy young iguana will be curious about its surrounding and will not be lying on the floor of its enclosure Often times we as humans like to select the one iguana in the enclosure that is \"calm\" and sits still while we hold it This is a pretty good sign that something is wrong, because most young iguanas will be fearful of human contact at first since it is in their nature The other fatal mistake that we as humans often make is to select the one iguana that looks sick, because we feel sorry for it and think that if we just take it home we can care for it and bring it back to health If an iguana is showing signs of illness it is a very good bet that the illness has been present for some time and that it has progressed to the point of being critical thus making our attempts to save the \"poor sick iguana \" and effort in futility only to result in our disappointment and the ultimate demise of the animal Avoid this trap by starting off with a health young iguana from the start Proper housing is essential to the care of a captive iguana and much care and consideration should be taken to provide the best possible enclosure A hatchling iguana may be kept in a 10-gallon glass aquarium but will soon require a larger enclosure A 29-gallon aquarium is suitable for a juvenile iguana , but eventually a custom built room sized cage will be required It is important to avoid using screen wire on any enclosure to prevent the iguana from rubbing its nose against it in an effort to escape which can result in rostral abrasions (nose rub) that can become very severe in a short period of time Iguanas require a light cycle of 12-14 hours per day This can best be achieved by providing the iguana with a commercial 50 watt basking bulb placed 6 inches from the top of the enclosure and mounted in a standard clamp type light fixture from any hardware store It has been a long standing rule that iguanas must be provided with a full-spectrum light that provides a UVB of 310 or higher in order for the iguanas to produce
