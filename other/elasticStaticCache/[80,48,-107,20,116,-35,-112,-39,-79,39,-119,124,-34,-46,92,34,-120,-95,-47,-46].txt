All actions (such as body movements, detection of objects of interest, or learning from others in a social group) begin with the acquisition of information. Thus, an animal’s sense organs are exceedingly important to its behaviour. They constitute a set of monitoring instruments with which the animal gathers information about itself and its environment. Each sense organ is selective, responding only to one particular form of energy; an instrument that responds indiscriminately to multiple forms of energy would be rather useless and similar to having none at all. The particular form of energy to which a sense organ responds determines its sensory modality. Three broad categories of sensory modalities are familiar to humans: chemoreception (exemplified by the senses of taste and smell but also including specialized receptors for pheromones and other behaviorally important molecules), mechanoreception (the basis for touch, hearing, balance, and many other senses, such as joint position), and photoreception (light sensitivity, including form and colour vision).",1.2723264694213867],["Jellyfish can sense smell and tastes using chemoreceptors.",1.271598219871521],["Jellyfish can sense smells and tastes using chemoreceptors.",1.271598219871521],["Jellyfish can sense smells and tastes using chemoreceptors .",1.271598219871521],["The Senses Smell and hearing can be useful adjuncts to an adventure.",1.271598219871521],["Dogs have long been recognized for their keen sense of smell and their ability to be trained to use that sense of smell to identify specific materials.",1.2708686590194702],["Dogs have long been recognized for their keen sense of smell and their ability to be trained to use that sense of smell to identify specific materials.",1.2708686590194702],["An example of smell in non-mammals is that of sharks , which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine the direction of a smell.",1.2592233419418335],["Smell also which is the object of the sense of smell will be there, since the Church sings that the bodies of the saints will be a most sweet smell.",1.2532525062561035],["Smell also which is the object of the sense of smell will be there, since the Church sings that the bodies of the saints will be a most sweet smell.",1.2532525062561035],["Smell also which is the object of the sense of smell will be there, since the Church sings that the bodies of the saints will be a most sweet smell.",1.2532525062561035],["Smell also which is the object of the sense of smell will be there, since the Church sings that the bodies of the saints will be a most sweet smell.",1.2532525062561035],["Basically, there are four terms under which olfactic abilities are classified: macrosmia (a good sense of smell), microsmia (a poor sense of smell, anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell), and parosmia (a perverted sense of smell).",1.2491121292114258],["a. ability to taste and smell b. ability to use energy c. ability to grow and develop d. ability to sense and respond to change",1.238906741142273],["a. ability to taste and smell b. ability to use energy c. ability to grow and develop d. ability to sense and respond to change",1.238906741142273],["How well can they smell? Cobras have a “Jacobsen’s Organ” (like most snakes) that gives them super smelling ability.

[62] Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. [62] Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. [62] Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. [62] Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. [62] The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. [62] Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. [62] For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. [62] The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. [62] Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. [62] An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. [62] For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. [62] Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.
