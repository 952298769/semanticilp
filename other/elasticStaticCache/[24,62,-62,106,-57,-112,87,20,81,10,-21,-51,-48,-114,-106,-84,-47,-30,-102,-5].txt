plants a major problem with this is that, over the centuries, our major crop plants have become dangerously genetically uniform lack of genetic variation means that crop species are dangerously vulnerable to a variety of diseases that means that if, for example, there's an outbreak of a disease or pest to which one crop plant is not resistant, that pest may wipe out that crop plant over a huge area historically, botanists have used \"wild ancestors\" of major crop species (potatoes, corn, rice) as the source of \"new\" genes note that this requires that we still have access to wild populations of the ancestors of major crop plants - and this is becoming a major conservation issue now, they can introduce genes from other organisms currently, for example, major producers of plant seeds are producing seeds that have been engineered to include genes that make the plants resistant to specific pests (by, e.g., producing toxins or distasteful compounds) this is controversial for several reasons: products of introduced genes may kill both beneficial and harmful pests genes may be transmitted to non-crop relatives many crop species are grown in areas that also support wild relatives pollen from the crop species will contain the engineered genes - and can be transmitted to plants growing at some distance from the crops themselves very few studies have tried to address the long-term effect these engineered genes might have if they \"escape\" into wild populations In addition to introducing genes to \"improve\" plants, we can also use engineered plants as \"factories\" to produce specific proteins for, e.g., pharmaceuticals this raises many of the same issues as above Human gene therapy Many important human diseases are caused by faulty genes (e.g.,
