Sediment Transport in Fluid Media (Water, Air, Mudflow etc) - fluid flow in natural settings generally occurs as turbulent flow but in special cases may occur as laminar flow - turbulence in fluids promotes erosion and sediment transport - generally the greater friction in the channel and the greater the velocity, the greater will be the turbulence - turbulent fluid motion, density contrasts
