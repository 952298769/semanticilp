Their western populations slightly declined during this time, but the loss was made up by an increase in eastern populations. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 41 million, with 54% living in Canada, and 46% in the U.S. They rate a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the 2014 State of the Birds Watch List . Forest clearing for agriculture or development can increase the amount of forest edge, which can improve habitat for chickadees, and this species also benefits from people who keep bird feeders. As with many birds that nest in tree cavities, chickadees can suffer if land managers cut too many dead trees out of forests.",2.034167528152466],["Many trees are cut down for development of more space, although this has increased peat forest fires.",1.9250082969665527],["The increased number of birds was attributed to the migration of birds from the newly clear-cut area to the forest fragment.",1.9159636497497559]]
