A clear light will thus also be thrown on the fact that flowers are invariably constructed so as to permit, or favour, or necessitate the union of two individuals. We shall clearly understand why monœcious and diœcious,—why dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist, and many other such cases. The plan which I have followed in my experiments is to grow plants in the same pot, or in pots of the same size, or close together in the open ground; to carefully exclude insects; and then to fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the same flower, and others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct but adjoining plant. In many, but not all, of these experiments, the crossed plants yielded much more seed than the self-fertilised plants; and I have never seen the {128}reversed case. The self-fertilised and crossed seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on damp sand; and as the seeds successively germinated, they were planted in pairs on opposite sides of the same pot, with a superficial partition between them, and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light. In other cases the self-fertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on opposite sides of the same small pot. I have, in short, followed different plans, but in every case have taken all the precautions which I could think of, so that the two lots should be equally favoured. Now, I have carefully observed the growth of plants raised from crossed and self-fertilised seed, from their germination to maturity, in species of the following genera, namely, Brassica, Lathyrus, Lupinus, Lobelia, Lactuca, Dianthus, Myosotis, Petunia, Linaria, Calceolaria, Mimulus, and Ipomœa, and the difference in their powers of growth, and of withstanding in certain cases unfavourable conditions, was most manifest and strongly marked. It is of importance that the two lots of seed should be sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot, so that the seedlings may struggle against each other; for if sown separately in ample and good soil, there is often but little difference in their growth.",1.1441620588302612],["Plant seeds in each type of soil and give each the same amount of water.",1.1358580589294434],["Plant seeds in each type of soil and give each the same amount of water.",1.1358580589294434],["My control variables were, the type of seed, seed brand, soil brand, depth of seed when sowed, amount of water, amount of sunlight, amount of time seeds are soaked, size of pots, brand of pots, amount of soil, and room environment.",1.107138991355896],["Two light treatments are available: full sun (1378.57 ± 79.69 μmol m−2 s−1) and 75% natural irradiance (893.71 ± 25.12 μmol m−2 s−1) (which correspond to the mean intensity of light captured by this species in the natural community) that were realized by covering with a canopied black nylon net above the pots and two planting density treatments (high density and low density) in the potted experiment. Seeds used for the experiment were collected randomly from more than 15 populations in September and October 2007 at Maqu station (33°45′N, 102°04′E, Maqu County, Gannan, Gansu Province, China, average altitude is over 3500 m a.s.l.). The seeds were cleaned, mixed well, and stored in paper bags in the dark at laboratory temperature. In early May 2008, the plastic pots (35 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) were filled with loam soil obtained from Hezuo station (the nutrient element contents of soil C: 0.68 ± 0.08 g/kg; N:0.27 ± 0.04 g/kg; P:0.66 ± 0.14 g/kg; PH: 6.27 ± 0.27). Each pot included 60 seeds that were buried into a depth of 1 cm. Given that L. virgaurea begins clonal growth in the second growing season (Wang et al. 2008 ), each pot had ≤5 plants (low density, ≈15/m2) and ≥35 plants (high density, ≈100/m2) at each light treatment at the beginning of the second growing season (in mid-May 2009). The densities treatment depended on the investigation of the natural population (low density, 18.33 ± 8.17/m2; high density, 75.44 ± 26.48/m2). Each treatment contained 40 pots, and they were arranged randomly at the same light condition.

Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures ( vernalization ) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.",0.9153556227684021],["Fill peat pots with good potting soil and plant about three seeds in each pot.",0.9130128026008606],["I put the same amount of potting soil in six large plastic cups and planted one teaspoon of grass seeds in each of them.",0.9094194769859314],["METHODOLOGY I took fifteen seeds and planted them in three pots in the same amount of soil.",0.9093997478485107],["Soils were considered local when seeds, which were collected from the same tree as the soil, were planted in that soil.",0.9061427712440491],["Each person in a group can grow a different kind of seed, or each person could test a different variable, such as temperature, amount of light, kind of soil, amount of water, types of fertilizer.",0.9056167006492615],["Measured out the same amount of grass seed and mixed it in each pot.",0.9056071639060974],["Measured out the same amount of grass seed and mixed it in each pot.",0.9056071639060974],["Childbirth is not the sowing of a seed planted by men, as if the woman were a passive pot of soil that simply nurtures the entire seed of humanity, which is contained in the sperm only.",0.9055602550506592],["Childbirth is not the sowing of a seed planted by men, as if the woman were a passive pot of soil that simply nurtures the entire seed of humanity, which is contained in the sperm only.",0.9055602550506592],["In the same pots kenaf seeds were planted 30 days later, almost when the crawfish was composted to some degree.",0.9032920002937317],["You would make sure all plants in both groups were the same distance from the window, got the same amount of water, were at the same temperature, had the same soil and pot size, etc.",0.9016940593719482],["As the seeds begin to sprout and grow, the students will identify which kind of seed they planted by comparing their pot to the identified pots planted by the teacher.",0.9013688564300537],["As the seeds begin to sprout and grow, the students will identify which kind of seed they planted by comparing their pot to the identified pots planted by the teacher.",0.9013688564300537],["Daniel's seeds were too warm inside of the shoebox Daniel should have used a different type of soil the jar helped Mudib's seeds to grow Daniel's seeds did not get enough light Mudib used different seeds 3 Five scientists are trying to determine which of four beakers of water is the coldest.",0.9005690217018127],["Some flowers of the Mimulus luteus were fertilised with their own pollen, and others were crossed with pollen from distinct plants growing in the same pot.

RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM :    Geophyte    Hemicryptophyte REGENERATION PROCESSES : Fireweed regenerates sexually and asexually.  Airborne seeds allow fireweed to establish rapidly [ 93 ].  Hungerford [ 103 ] noted that an opening in a canopy was not enough to ensure fireweed establishment. Fireweed requires bare mineral soil in addition to high light for germination [ 137 ].  Moisture supply is more stable and more nutrients are available on a mineral soil seedbed [ 137 ].  Once established, it forms large colonies via rhizomes and produces large amounts of seed [ 41 ]. Vegetative Reproduction:  Vegetative reproduction is more prevalent than sexual reproduction [ 29 ].  Fireweed may not flower every year in the northern limits of its range or at alpine elevations in the southern limits [ 43 , 185 ]. Fireweed readily sprouts from rhizomes following disturbance.  Fireweed was a residual survivor on Mount St. Helens, Washington, following the 1980 volcanic eruption [ 143 , 152 ].  Shoots sprouting from rhizomes are capable of very rapid growth; they may bloom within 1 month [ 195 ]. Fragmentation of rhizomes stimulates shoot production [ 41 ].  A 4-year-old rhizome was excavated and found to be 20 feet (6.1 m) long; it had 56 perennating buds.  Rhizome length depends on soil fertility and amount of competing vegetation present [ 104 ]. Sexual Reproduction:  Fireweed flowers can self-cross or outcross [ 29 ]. They are principally pollinated by insects [ 29 ].  Fireweed is a prolific seed producer [ 41 ].  One plant may produce about 80,000 seeds per year [ 196 ].  In seed traps placed on a burn in Saskatchewan, fireweed represented 63 percent of all germinated seeds [ 11 ].  One year after the Mount St. Helens explosion, 81 percent of seed collected in seed traps were fireweed seeds [ 55 ].  Fireweed was one of the most abundant colonizers on Mount St. Helens [ 143 , 152 , 158 ]. Seeds are nondormant and germinate over a variety of temperatures.  One hundred percent of newly collected fireweed seeds germinated within 10 days [ 29 ].  Fireweed does not create a long-lived seed bank [ 10 , 110 , 146 ]. Most seeds lose viability after 18 to 24 months [ 29 , 43 , 87 ].  Optimum germinating conditions are warm, well-lighted, and humid [ 29 ].  Seed collected from subalpine (9,285 feet [2,830 m]) meadows in the Sierra Nevada, California, gave 55 to 68 percent germination under day/night temperature regimes of 62/55 degrees Fahrenheit (17/13 deg C) and 81/73 degrees Fahrenheit (27/23 deg C), respectively.  The lowest percent germination (12 percent) was at 53.6/46.4 degrees Fahrenheit (12/8 deg C) [ 37 ].  Broderick [ 29 ] reported similar germination rates; however, he saw 86 percent germination at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 deg C). Fireweed seed hairs or plumes respond to humidity.  Increased humidity causes a decreased plume diameter which results in reduced loft [ 55 ]. This increases the chance that seeds are deposited in places with moisture adequate for germination.  Plumed seed has low rates (0.21 to 0.23 foot per second [0.065-0.069 m/s]) of fall in still air [ 196 ]. Using modified insect suction traps mounted on radio towers, Solbreck and Andersson [ 196 ] found that 20 to 50 percent of the seeds sampled at 328 feet (100 m) in an air column above a burned forest in Sweden were fireweed seeds.  Since the seeds were commonly aloft for 10 hours per day, they suggested that the seeds traveled 62.2 to 186.5 miles (100-300 km) during that time.  Broderick [ 29 ] reported that the seed rain of fireweed for all of northern Quebec was 3.7 seeds per square foot (40 seeds/sq m). SITE CHARACTERISTICS : Fireweed tolerates a wide range of site and soil conditions, but it most commonly occurs on disturbed ground.  It is abundant in coniferous forests, mixed forests, aspen parklands, grasslands, sylvotundra (i.e., area between treeless tundra and circumpolar coniferous forest), and muskegs [ 54 , 134 , 144 , 163 , 210 ].  Fireweed grows on disturbed areas such as cut-over or burned forests and swamps, avalanche areas, recently deglaciated areas, and riverbars [ 22 , 101 , 153 , 208 ].  Additional disturbed sites are highway and railroad rights-of-way, waste places, and old fields [ 94 , 188 ]. In North America, fireweed occurs in maritime to strongly continental climates with short, warm summers and long, cold winters [ 28 , 229 ]. Annual precipitation averages between 13 inches (330 mm) on the north-central edge of its range and 134.7 inches (3,420 mm) on the west coastal edge [ 4 , 28 ]. Fireweed occurs on soils that vary from thin layers above permafrost in the subarctic regions to deep loams in the western United States [ 136 ]. Soil development ranges from clays and clayey loams to sandy loams to unweathered parent material [ 4 , 73 ].  Organic matter may be low in fireweed soils or very high and peaty [ 227 ].  Low soil pH may affect plant fertility.  Fireweed grown in soil with pH 3.5 produced 80 percent fewer seeds than plants grown in soil with pH 5.0 [ 29 ].  Fireweed may occur in neutral soils [ 48 , 208 ].  Northern soils in which fireweed occurs may be frozen 4 to 5 months or longer [ 29 ]. Fireweed occurs on flat to rolling topography or moderate to steep slopes [ 12 ].  It is found from sea level to high alpine elevations [ 89 , 185 ].  Mueggler [ 162 ] found no significant (p>0.05) effect of aspect on the frequency of fireweed in burned areas in Idaho. Fireweed has numerous common associates.  Trees associated with fireweed include Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), American hazel (Corylus americana), Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and swamp black gum (Nyssa biflora) [ 22 , 53 , 69 , 153 ]. Common shrubs found with fireweed are snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus), snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), hoary willow (Salix candida), black twinberry (Lonicera involucrata), and common juniper (Juniperus communis) [ 123 , 130 , 134 , 136 , 178 , 229 ]. Other postdisturbance species associated with fireweed are bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), pinegrass (C. rubescens), purple reedgrass (C. purpurascens), and Wyoming wildrye (Leymus flavescens) [ 65 , 97 , 136 , 190 , 227 ].  In moister grasslands, fireweed occurs with sedges (Carex spp.) and sailorcaps shootingstar (Dodecatheon conjugens) [ 210 ]. Pteridophyte associates are western swordfern (Polystichum minutum), brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum), and woodland horsetail (Equisetum sylvaticum) [ 21 , 229 ].  Important liverwort and moss associates are Marchantia polymorpha and Ceratodon purpureus [ 226 ]. (Also see Distribution and Association) SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : Fireweed is an important colonizer following vegetation disturbances in temperate climates worldwide [ 46 , 157 ].  Although the role of fireweed as an early seral species does not change, the length of time fireweed populations are present varies among ecosystems.  Fireweed enters a disturbed community and rapidly becomes abundant.  It may achieve a peak in dominance within 2 to 3 years [ 43 ].  It starts low in frequency and density if it must seed in from off-site [ 118 ].  Halpern [ 86 ] found that after disturbance in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in Oregon, fireweed cover peaked in year 7 and then slowly declined. Fireweed populations can maintain themselves through vegetative reproduction if conditions are not conducive to flowering.  Depending upon surrounding vegetation fireweed may create widely spaced colonies with low stem densities [ 29 ].  In Alaska, ground that was covered 30 years by debris from oil exploration was cleared or burned [ 64 ]. Fireweed vegetatively colonized these areas at low frequencies and cover.  In 20 study sites in Montana, Stickney [ 202 ] reported that fireweed established with about 3 percent cover 1 year after disturbance.  By the second year, it peaked at about 30 percent cover and stayed around this amount for the next 8 years. Fireweed is one of the first plants to enter a community during the seedling/herb stage [ 3 , 50 ].  This may last 1 to 15 years in the Yukon Territory [ 92 ].  Sometimes, it will persist into the pole stage [ 84 ]. Young forests differ in the range of microhabitats (i.e., variations in light, nutrients, and moisture) available; fireweed will persist if a stand is open [ 43 ]. Moore [ 157 ] stated that fireweed declined in successional communities because soil conditions became unsuitable for growth as nutrients are leached out.  However, other studies suggest that fireweed declines due to the effects of competing vegetation [ 149 , 207 ].  Progressive changes from open to closed canopy in a forest result in decreasing abundance of fireweed [ 3 , 40 , 207 ].  Several studies report that fireweed is shade intolerant [ 81 , 115 , 124 , 157 , 182 , 217 ].  However, it can exist in partial shade with a corresponding reduction in productivity [ 200 ].  Shirley [ 192 ] found that fireweed response to Norway pine (Pinus resinosa) canopy cover was variable.  At 5 percent of total sunlight, fireweed occurred with 62 percent frequency; at 10 percent of total sunlight, fireweed occurred with 100 percent frequency [ 192 ].  Frequency of fireweed plants declined to 50 percent at 45 percent of total sunlight and then, increased to 100 percent frequency at 65 to 100 percent of total sunlight.  Mueggler [ 162 ] found a significant (p<0.05) decrease in fireweed frequency when tree canopy cover exceeded 41 percent. Fireweed colonizes recent alluvial deposits [ 132 ].  It acts as a pioneer species on glacial moraines, establishing with willows (Salix spp.) on exposed gravel, sand, and silt bars [ 216 , 226 ].  In Glacier Bay, Alaska, the pioneer stage with fireweed and willows lasts 1 to 5 years [ 213 ]. In succession on delta swamps in Michigan, the grass stage with bluejoint reedgrass and fireweed follows the sedge-mat stage.  The grass stage is succeeded by a shrub stage [ 44 ]. Fireweed is an indicator of a mid-seral stage of succession in the herb layer of the grand fir/Rocky mountain maple (Abies grandis/Acer glabrum) habitat type in central Idaho [ 200 ].  It is an indicator of early seral stages in grand fir/blue huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare) habitat types [ 198 ]. SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : The time ranges given here for the phenological stages of fireweed reflect its widespread distribution, varying from region to region and from habitat to habitat.  Root growth can begin at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.5 deg C), preceding stem emergence [ 29 ].  Shoots emerge in spring (late March to early June).  Leaves are full grown approximately 1 month after emergence [ 43 ].  Maximum biomass occurs in summer (August) and may be 0.12 to 0.19 pounds per square foot (0.6-0.9 kg/sq m) [ 43 ].  Flowers bloom June through September [ 83 , 111 , 164 , 188 , 191 , 224 ].  Fruits mature approximately 1 month later [ 187 ].  Seeds are released beginning in August and continue to be shed after shoots have died from frost injury [ 43 , 187 ].  Foliage will turn color with limited water availability in the late summer and fall [ 62 ].  Seeds germinate late summer or fall, and seedlings overwinter as a rosette [ 43 ].  The primary and secondary roots of seedlings may develop buds which overwinter [ 195 ].  Shoot buds form in the fall on lateral roots and overwinter just below the soil surface [ 29 ].",0.8599167466163635],["In three experiments, each comprising 21 different isolates collected from 2010 to 2013 as described above plus the two control isolates, each lentil line was sown into 96 pots, four seeds per pot, which were thinned to three seedlings per pot after emergence.",0.8592610955238342],["To stratify seeds place them in cold, moist potting soil (sterilized soil is best but is not required) in a dark place for several weeks or months.",0.8568123579025269],["There were also some Tea-seeds, which came from the same place;",0.8556342720985413],["Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as the wild-type control for these experiments.

Plants were grown under a chamber (22°C; 120 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity; 16 h light/8 h dark cycle; 70% relative humidity). For phenotype analysis in early seedlings under normal conditions, four day-old seedlings were used to determine the root hairs, then the seedlings were transferred to half-strength MS medium for 15 days, and then the photos were taken and roots length were measured. For salt stress tolerance analysis in early seedlings, four day-old seedlings were transferred to half-strength MS or the same medium supplemented with 50–150 mM NaCl for 15 days, then the photos were taken, and then root length and root hairs were measured. For salt stress tolerance analysis in adult plants, Arabidopsis plants at four weeks of age were irrigated with 350 mM NaCl for 15 days, then the photos were taken, and then survival rates were assessed. For osmotic stress tolerance analysis, four day-old seedlings were transferred to half-strength MS or the same medium supplemented with 100–300 mM mannitol for 15 days, then the photos were taken, and then root length and root hairs were measured. For drought stress tolerance analysis, plants were grown in pots filled with a mixture of soil and sand (3:1) at 22°C for four weeks. Water was withheld from the treatment group for 20 days, then the photos were taken and survival rates were calculated. For expression analysis of ABA-responsive genes in WT and transgenic lines, fifteen day-old seedlings were transferred to half-strength MS agar plates supplemented with 350 mM NaCl for up to 10 h or 300 mM mannitol for up to 6 h. Whole seedlings were used to quantify relative gene expression.",0.8545671701431274],["Seeds were sown in vinyl pots filled with vermiculite.",0.8542572259902954],["Turnip plants were raised from seeds in pots filled with soils amended with chromium.",0.8518523573875427],["After a month, seeds can be placed in a paper cups with compost and potting soil mixture.
