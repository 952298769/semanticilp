This is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism. Through heredity, variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve . Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits —particular characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the \"brown-eye trait\" from one of their parents. Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype . The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype . These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment . As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children.

For instance, brown eyes are dominant and thus would be represented in shorthand with a capital B, whereas blue eyes, which are recessive, would be represented with a lowercase b.
