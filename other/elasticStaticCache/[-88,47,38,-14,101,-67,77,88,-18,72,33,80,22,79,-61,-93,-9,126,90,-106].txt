RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",1.171026587486267],["They will also show you how to collect water from various plants, this is a desert survival course from the masters of desert survival.",1.1350599527359009],["Desert plants also use less water and generally involve less fuss.",1.1229652166366577],["How plants survive in the desert ecoystem for up to a year without a drop of water, Why plants in the tropical rain forest ecosystem have drip tips, Where plants grow without soil, and much more.",1.103266716003418],["Solar-thermal plants (like most conventional power plants) also require cooling water, which may be costly or scarce in desert areas.",1.0989034175872803],["Others, like the desert kangaroo rat, seldom drank water but survive by eating seeds, plants, and metabolizing fat to produce water.",1.097630500793457],["Another interesting plant is nicknamed \"the desert well\" and also excels in its ability to store water.",1.093959093093872],["instead, desert or semi-desert plants live to the water's edge.",1.0824205875396729],["Concept Desert plants store and conserve water.",1.0819182395935059],["There are roots that store water for the plant (many desert species);",1.0819182395935059],["Desert plants store as much water as they can inside their bodies, to be used as they need it.",1.080568790435791],["However, the desert tortoise may go for many years without drinking, ingesting most of their water from plants and then storing it in their bladders.",1.0729414224624634],["desert plants survive if temperatures are high when there is little rain), What months see a moisture deficit and requires people to store water and irrigate?",1.0689270496368408],["However rain comes sporadically and can be used to supplement irrigation for oasis and transition zone plants but can be the sole water source for desert zone plants.",1.0661906003952026],["Like the plants, desert animals must live on as little water as possible.",1.065651535987854],["Examples of desert plants which store water are shown, and desert animals, reptiles and birds are pictured briefly.",1.0543262958526611],["For example, only plants adapted to limited amounts of water can live in deserts.",1.0486657619476318],["In \"Water\" Abbey discusses the how the ecosystem adapts to the arid conditions of the Southwest, but also the springs, creeks and other stores of water to be found in the desert and in their own ways support some of the diverse but fragile plant and animal life.",1.0480173826217651],["The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor.",1.0332300662994385],["In deserts, they can get their required water from the moisture of succulent plants.",1.0331991910934448],["Packrats get their water by ingesting desert plants.",1.0321801900863647],["How do plants get water in a desert?",1.0321801900863647],["Packrats get their water by ingesting desert plants.",1.0321801900863647],["It also requires less water than currently used by conventional plants operated by the company, a plus for a desert environment.",1.0296151638031006],["It also requires less water than currently used by conventional plants operated by the company, a plus for a desert environment.",1.0296151638031006],["It also requires less water than currently used by conventional plants operated by the company, a plus for a desert environment.",1.0296151638031006],["You will be a part of the fight for water and life as you get to know the plants and animals of the hot, dry desert.",1.029354453086853],["The conventional wisdom is that drip irrigation of desert plants requires less water than other types of landscape and irrigation systems.",1.02358877658844],["The ability of a soil to store water for plant growth could be most accurately judged from knowing which characteristic?",1.0218068361282349]]
