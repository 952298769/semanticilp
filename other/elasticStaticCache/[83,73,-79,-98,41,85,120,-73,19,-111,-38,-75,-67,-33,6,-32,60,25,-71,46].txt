[["In a nutshell we can say that a Butterfly passes through four stages in its life cycle. Usually it lays eggs on a leaf. When the eggs hatch a small larva emerges and crawls out. This larva of a butterfly is called a caterpillar which starts eating the leaf and grows This is the active stage. During its life it moults a few times. Each time it becomes bigger. Soon it changes into a pupa. This pupa may be hanging on the plant in a small loop of silk. And after a few weeks the pupa turns into a beautiful adult butterfly.",5.056341648101807],["Ex: a butterfly's life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, butterfly)",4.823360443115234],["The butterfly life cycle has four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.",4.3822197914123535],["Label the stages in a butterfly life cycle from egg to larva to pupa to adult.",4.3822197914123535],["The life-cycle of the butterfly is divided into four stages, egg, larva, pupa and adult.",4.3822197914123535],["Life Cycle of a Butterfly : Egg --> Larva (the caterpillar) --> Pupa (the chrysalis or cocoon) --> Adult.",4.3822197914123535],["There are four stages in the butterfly life cycle: Egg, Larva, Pupa, and Adult.",4.3822197914123535],["Schreiner (1997) describes the four stages of the life cycle of a butterfly: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. First, the adult butterfly lays its eggs on the appropriate host plant. Then, the eggs hatch and small larvae emerge. The larval stage is subdivided into different phases called instars, and as the instar stage progresses, the larvae grow larger (Benrey and Denno, 1997). Subsequently, after sufficient food is obtained and converted into energy, the larvae then transform into pupae. Inside the pupae, the larva form disintegrates and reorganizes itself into the adult form. After about a week, the pupa opens and the butterfly emerges (Schreiner, 1997).",4.237039089202881],["Briefly, a butterfly starts as an egg. After about 4 to 5 days (some species take up to 3 weeks or longer), the egg hatches and a tiny larva (caterpillar) emerges. The larva starts to eat and will shed its skin 4 to 6 times as it gets bigger and bigger. After about 2 to 4 weeks, the larva will be full-grown and transforms itself into a pupa/chrysalis. Inside the pupa, the caterpillar's body breaks down into a kind of soup and is reorganized into the adult structures of the butterfly! This stage can take between 10 to 15 days. Finally, the adult butterfly emerges from the pupa. Adult butterflies will mate, the female will lay eggs and the life cycle starts over.
