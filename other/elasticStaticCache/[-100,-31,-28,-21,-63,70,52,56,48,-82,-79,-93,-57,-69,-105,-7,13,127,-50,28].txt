a tree is what the wind is or have any reason to touch the tree, it is only the ability to feel the strength of the wind and freshness of the wind on ones face, to feel the wind, moving ones hair or clothing that alows normal people to know what the wind is, it is the smell and texture of the tree that makes people want to reach out and touch the tree without the true ability to feel there is no reason to want to touch it or to smell it, if one can do neither of the above how can one under stand what life is or what people are talking about as most peoples coversations revolve around the senses , to apreciate sight one has to involve the senses,think about any action, it is what one has learnt of the senses that alows us to apreciate sight, how do we apreciate movement a person running , it is the under standing of the senses that we have learnt while growing up that gives us the ability to apreciate what movement is, to under stand the above is to know what autism means to me,we can not laugh, cry, sing, or talk normally without being able to know or feel what the senses are, we live in a world of no-sense which unfortunately, turns into a world of non-sense as far as
