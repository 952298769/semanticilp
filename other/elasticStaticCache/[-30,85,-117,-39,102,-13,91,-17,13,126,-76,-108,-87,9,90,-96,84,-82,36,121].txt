[["Powerful Idea Evaporation of Liquids After a rain, puddles dry up.",1.5304796695709229],["Since we are talking about a cycle, there really is no beginning we can start from, so let’s just start at evaporation. A good way to think about evaporation is to consider how many puddles there are after a storm. Especially on a hot day, when the sun comes out after a storm, many puddles disappear quickly. It doesn’t actually disappear, though, it just changes form, from liquid to water vapor. This process actually removes heat from the environment, which is why sweat evaporating from your body cools you off. Changing from a liquid to a gas, water then travels up through the atmosphere, eventually changing back into a liquid through another process in the water cycle.",1.5019643306732178]]
