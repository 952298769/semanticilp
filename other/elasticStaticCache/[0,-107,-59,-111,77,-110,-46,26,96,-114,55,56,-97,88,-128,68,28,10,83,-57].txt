models to demonstrate that all cells have specialized structures that carry out specialized functions (e.g. microscopic or photographic evidence) Describe the major functions of the living cell and discuss how different groups of cells perform interrelated functions in any organism Discuss, using observation, experimentation, and modeling, the connections between the structure and functions of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems Construct models that demonstrate which chemical elements make up the molecules of substances found in living organisms and how these elements pass through food webs Describe how essential materials enter cells and how waste and other materials leave the cell (e.g. passive transport and active transport) Explain how cells use nutrients as a source of energy (e.g. respiration, photosynthesis) Compare the transformation of matter and energy during photosynthesis and respiration Ecology Students will be able to: Relate different kinds of animals and plants to their habitat by observing their physical characteristics Develop appropriate food webs for the major biomes of the earth and accurately describe the major biogeochemical cycles which control the interactions between the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem Investigate the interdependence of plants and animals in the biomes of New Hampshire Predict, with rationale, the effects of changing one or two factors in an ecosystem Research and present a model that demonstrates how ecosystems are reasonably stable over hundreds of thousands of years, dependent on climate, limiting factors, carrying capacities, and biogeochemical cycles Make predictions about changes in the size or growth rate of a population using mathematical models (e.g. graphs charts, exponential growth curve, logistic growth curve, carrying capacity) Trace the history of an interaction between man and the environment that demonstrates how human activities can deliberately or inadvertently alter the equilibrium in an ecosystem Design and perform an experiment to show that the number of living things any environment can support is limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, minerals, and ability of an ecosystem to recycle organic material Classification (Taxonomy) Students will be able to: Identify and give examples of representative life forms in the five kingdoms of living things Identify and describe differences among organisms of different, but closely related taxa Human Biology Students will be able to: Describe/explain homeostasis (e.g. the maintenance of internal stability within organisms) Describe the life cycles of representative organisms that cause human diseases Describe the use of technology in prevention diagnosis, and the treatment of disease (e.g. sanitation, medicines, organ transplants, adequate food, and water supplies) Investigate behavioral patterns found in different life forms (e.g. communication, orientation, hormonal regulation, learning, and conditioning) Plants (Botany) Students will be able to: Identify the different structures of a plant and explain their function Explain the life cycles of different plants Relate physical characteristics of different plants to survival in their habitat Describe the ecological role of plants and explain their significance in today's world Animals (Zoology) Students will be able to: Relate physical characteristics of different animals to survival in their habitat Explain the relationship of different organism based upon their anatomical, physical, and behavioral characteristics Explain the life cycles of different animals Describe the ecological role of animals and explain their significance in today's world Relate the behavior of an animal to its ability to survive in the area that it inhabits Fungi Students will be able to: Identify the different structures of a fungus and to explain their function Explain the life cycles of different fungi Relate behavioral and physical characteristics of different fungi to survival in their habitat Describe the ecological role of fungi and explain their significance in today's world Microbes Students will be able to: Identify the different structures of a microbe and to explain their function Explain the life cycles of different microbes Relate behavioral and physical characteristics of different microbes to survival in their habitat Describe the ecological role of microbes and explain their significance in today's world Genetics Students will be able to: Interpret simple genetic crosses and predict/explain the patterns that emerge Explain how the characteristics of living things depend upon genes Estimate the degree of kinship among organisms or species (e.g. their DNA and chromosome makeup) Describe how genetic material is passed down from parent to offspring during sexual and asexual reproduction (e.g. mitosis, meiosis, and budding) Research a human genetic trait and trace its appearance/presence through a family history and predict the inheritance patterns and probabilities of the next generation (e.g. pedigree and Punnet Squares) Explain how new genetic traits can arise and become established in a population (e.g. mutations of DNA, gene linkages, crossing over) Explain, in general terms, the role DNA plays in controlling cell functions Evolution Students will be able to: Construct a \"time line\" that depicts how life forms change over time as they interact in and with the environment Explain the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of organisms Discuss how changes in the DNA can create physical changes that are favorable or detrimental to the survival of the organism Describe the process of speciation and the adaptation of organisms to new environments Relate the impact of humans on the evolution of different organisms (e.g. peppered moth) and explain the process of artificial selection",1.0869590044021606],["Modeling
