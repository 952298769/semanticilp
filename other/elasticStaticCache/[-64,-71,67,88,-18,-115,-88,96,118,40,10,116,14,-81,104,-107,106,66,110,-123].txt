for use on live microorganisms - uses an opaque disc to prevent light from directly passing through the slide - allows only light entering the slide from the side to pass through - shows the object against a dark background - Phase Contrast Microscopy - for viewing internal structures in living microbes - two sets of light rays are used - one passing directly through the specimen - one that is reflected (diffracted) through the specimen -
