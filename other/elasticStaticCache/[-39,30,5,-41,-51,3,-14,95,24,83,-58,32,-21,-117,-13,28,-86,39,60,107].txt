such as him innocence that I took for granted inside the fairy tale crystal palace that I lived in as a youth of course it was only make believe but grim reality never intruded into my world of multi-hued rainbows that transported me beyond my petty troubles unlike this child the young boy from Kosovo he stands poised this warrior that should only be fighting make believed monsters typical of childhood that all children do or playing dodge ball with his friends neighbors not ducking real bullets aimed by some half crazed soldier the child in the picture he witnessed unspeakable monstrosities made worse by the \nreality of it all grieving as close friends bled and died in but the golden spring of their childhood I played war as a child but never like this lad with real bullets and guns I can eaily place my child who I never knew existed too easily into this scene shining light brown hair blown around by a light breeze but instead of endless gales of laughter streaming out of him only silent pain radiates out from eyes made ancient before their time the final touch the final horror attracts my sight instead of a ball or a prized toy he holds a gun in his small grasp I wonder about mankind's future as I turn sadly away don't they realize that by destroying the innocence of youth they destroy the hope of the Earth's redemption Coat of Many Colors Lord of All by Paul Vernon Deffendall COME UNTO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST it doesn't matter what color you are it doesn't matter how you show your love I offer unconditional love for all my creations no one is better than anybody else or even of a superior race can you choose which child you like best I created the wholeuniverse to hold mankind my greatest work and my greatest disappointment they're too eager too choose the perfect race the perfect people among their idea of what perfection is killing off what they consider to be below their society I don't understand if I could not choose what makes them believe that they have the wisdom no I created perfection the great tapestry that mankind represents inside of my being the brilliance of the rainbow on the coat of many colors that the planet Earth wears depends on the color of all mankind no one is above anyone else I should know I AM THE CREATOR I AM LORD OF ALL Dance of the Innocents by Paul Vernon Deffendall In memory of Melody Elaine Smith July 11, 1961 - April 30, 1996 may she rest in peace graveyard silent a Celtic cross poises in the midst of the fields of innocents some days the cross cries with dew drops but in the sunset and the racing rays of fading light the drops reminds me of tears of blood silently dripping from who knows where especially at dusk one can see an image form from the Celtic cross a young lady a masculine man or some being of indiscriminate sex and an unguessable age I don't know or can even guess as I sit nearby just out of sight to honor an old girlfriend who died young thinking of my feelings that long laid dorment in my soul an image a vision I'm not exactly sure in this sanctuary of eternal rest that seems to belong in another universe not of sorrows but of extreme ecstacy storybook drawings of what paradise looks like dances in front of my eyes strange I think I never done this before as my thoughts blend with reality and a vision appears so real to me that I blink several times to make sure I'm not hallucinating no it's real including the background strumming of a harp not until then do I notice the strange figure standing at a newly dug grave I noticed it earlier just has I arrived a polished marble tombstone reflecting the dying sun a single ray illuminating the dates of birth and death It's a baby's plot surrounded by others and statues of baby angels and little lambs all the trapings of a nursery that one expects to view only it's strangely out of place here a soul newly formed to spend a lifetime of joys and hardships cut down too soon now the figures sighs over the tiny grave and from it's back wings sprout until I realze that she's an angel perhaps the caretaker of the tiny ones I shouldn't be here I'm contaminating this holy sight by my very pressence too old to locked up in my own sorrows in my own knowledge of my inner nature perhaps even locked up in my knowledge that I could have done something different I don't know what yet I find myself glued to the spot when I try to leave and I sense for a moment the angel's tender eyes on me tender and sad as if she failed in one of her tasks but then the feeling melted away as she looked somewhere else and my own puzzled glance followed hers she spred her wings to the cool breeze wearing a halo shining bright above her head she holds her arms out as if to receive some gift from above and a smile plays across her face and eyes that defie all description twinkle in the star light slowly a nimbus of pure energy drifts up from the freshly dug grave gaining solidity as it approaches her arms a special burden that she's been given to care for eternity as a tiny infant at last lies in her embrace with happy cooing and gurgling the little girl that died young with this miracle I find myself once again conjuring up images of the happiness I once knew so long ago a vision a ghostly time that calls me back to a more innocent time in my life before I grew cold and uncaring about love when all I needed for true happiness was a single touch from my girlfriend and a single glance from her love filled eyes we were young and innocent only she never stopped believing in the goodness of mankind and the realities of miracles showing up every day me I turned to wonder the darker side of my soul living only to see the worst of people and the worst of the world convincing myself that nothing deserved to be saved \nor worshipped what happened to change me so I'll never know so she left my side who cared what's love anyway but some false emotion or so I thought at that time of my life a night time made worse because it's of my own doing because I made the sacrifice that lead to this time and to the cemetary of broken promises of broken hopes I find myself wishing that I could see her one last time to heal the one last mistake that I made in my life not that I deserve to be treated differently I got what I deserved she's with the angels and I walk alone with only my memories and thoughts about what might have been I glance at the angel lovingly kissing the baby girl and her eyes sparkling with all the colors known to men and with colors unknown except to the angels I notice that those eyes rest on me with understanding and a reflection of my pain radiates from them a look I've seen too many times before on my own face in the mirror a look a little child wears when mommy's gone and he or she has to face the world alone for the very first time totally lost looking for some kind of support not knowing who to trust in this strange new world I never thought I'll ever see such a look on an angel's face she sighs carrying the baby in her arms gently rocking her back and forth her voice easily merging with the harp in the background pure music without mankind's imperfections carrying the mystical flow a touch of paradise in this sanctuary of innocent souls like the baby girl's like my old girlfriend's how I wish now that I could turn back the clock and see her alive if only for a millisecond and hear her voice calling my name once more I wonder why once again she was taken so young her life still laid ahead of her and I wonder why I'm allowed to live after all the many years that I sought passive suicide maybe it's true that only the good dies young I find myself crying knowing that some believe that a man shouldn't cry but why should I care about what others think I never have before and a man should be allowed to cry if only to ease a broken heart for a little while soft footprints behind me so soft I'm not sure just when I noticed them or the angel smiling directly at me as if she approves of my crying I don't know this night and its surprises has carried me beyond to some other realm where anything can happen and the world outside the cemetery seems to be a part of another universe although there's nothing seperating it from this reality my thoughts belong to the past for now as I watch her grave earlier I talked to her to this spot that is the only reminder that she lived and now sleeps forever alone with no company except for the occassional visits from her family now I'm here on this anniversary of my lady's death the angel of my morning do you ever forget the first person you love a soft touch on my shoulder startles me back into the present at first I'm confused not knowing st first when or even why I was conscious of the soft footsteps but not in the way that intruded in my private musings it takes me a while to realize that only the wall stands behind no one entered from the front although I'm not sure of anything this night a fleeting memory of a long lost time from a different era when hope flourished inside my being long before I grew cold just seventeen a tentative touch on my shoulder soothing a building rage from deep inside a tormented soul from a girl I barely knew yet she sensed my need and knew somehow to respect my privacy but I looked almost against my will and seen her concerned look shining in her eyes past visions when will they stop haunting me in the daytime light where I no longer dwell I'm a creature of the shadows now the morning's long gone and twilight is here visions even from the scent she bore of freshness and the start of a new day after a terrible night full of storms of doubts and uncertainties aagain a soft touch lights on my shoulders more demanding the pain flares inside my heart I find myself turning around against my will to be met by a quizzical look from a pair of spectacular eyes glorious red hair shining in the pale moon light everything as I remember from my dreams I turn my back quickly avoiding meeting the angel's eyes as I quickly get up and take off walking fast and trying not to think until I hear my name I stop not knowing just what to do pain racking my heart and tears streaming down my face I feel her look resting on my back just patiently waiting for my next move I stood there in the road a few feet away from the car in a moment that lasts forever yet at the same time no time passes in the mundane world before I sigh and say that it's nice to see her she waits for my next move the angel appears in front of me holding the baby and I give her a weak smile in a low whisper I ask hesitantly can I have this dance a low laugh greets me I never danced with her even though I knew she wanted to a little boy lost a grown man holding his breath soft footsteps behind me \nas I turn around to face an impossible dream turn into reality silently I look at her with all my love showing in my gaze not knowing or even caring as I take her again into my loving arms we dance alone in the moonlight not saying a word I didn't care about anything but her then the angel joins us in the celebration of renewal I feel as one reborn new to this world and the breath of freshness blows into my soul we talk quietly long into the night sitting on the hood of my grey chevy about the past and what happened as heavenly music hums in the background I found forgiveness in the long talk in the cemetery just before dawn she whispers that she has to go but she'll always be with me I walk her

looked again in a mirror And became lost in the person that was reflected there Yesterday I was in a unfamiliar place That I once called my second home Pictures of myself and another girl plastered the walls And I cried, staring at the memories I'd forgotten Her mom entered the room Eyes red Lips shaking And hugged me like she used to when I always came for another sleep over Neither of us could believe she'd ended her life I climb the stairs to my own room And for once look at the happy memories from my past And I see her face Smiling, laughing, pouting At me At the camera For the world to see So caught up in losing weight that wasn't there Obsession overcame what she knew And, too frustrated with herself and the unfair world, Ended her greatness Tears streaming I look again at my reflection And I realize those gray mornings That I woke with Feeling intimidated and unrefined Were bogus Because someone loved me And even though our souls had separated She cared, deep down And I cared, too, deep down But our two worlds didn't collide And save one another Until now My hair is mussed My eyes are dull My body too thin for a normal person The drugs have caused me to lose my shine
