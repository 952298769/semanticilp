proposed Purposes of taxonomy provide an unambiguous identification for each organism provides a way of understanding the relationships among diverse species Methods of taxonomy comparative biology compares characteristics of organisms characteristics can be anatomical - presence of limbs, head, different organs, body cavity cellular - presence of types of cells or tissues, presence of organelles reproductive modes - lays egg, live birth molecular - presence of types of genes, sequences genes organisms are named and grouped based on defined sets of characteristics groups start small with organisms which are the only ones possessing a trait - species groups are then put together to form larger groups which have more characteristics in common - genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom - these groups are called taxa Phylogeny the evolutionary relationship among different taxa sort of a family tree early taxonomic schemes predated the concept of evolution and/or modern biochemical techniques used for comparisons this resulted in groupings of organisms which weren&#146;t correctly organized with respect to their evolutionary origins there is currently a lot of research into taxonomy and phylogeny using new molecular tools Characteristics used to construct phylogenies shared traits - synapomorphies traits which all members of a group under consideration share i.e. chordates - all have a notochord during sometime in their life cycle i.e. birds - all have feathers there are characteristics which are homologous between groups of organism homologous characteristics are those which share a common evolutionary origin limbs of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals homologous structures have very similar embryonic origins there are also similar characteristics which are not homologous structures i.e. wings in insects and wings in birds these are non-homologous structures although they perform the same function - flight since these structure perform the same task, flight, they are referred to as orthologous structures derived characteristics those characteristics which are only present in the group of animals being studied ancestral characteristics those present both in the group being studied and in other groups the idea is that ancestral characters would be those found in direct ancestors of the group under consideration a derived character for one group can be an ancestral character for another, more advanced group the arrangement of groups based on synapomorphy of derived characters is hierarchical How do we 1 st determine what characteristics should be used to then determine phylogeny traits determined by methods already described chief among these is molecular biology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology molecular biology sequences of rRNA and mitochondrial DNA comparative embryology - recapitulation to understand how adult structures arise and their potential relationships as homologous

prokaryotic - lack peptidoglycan in cell walls - obligate anaerobes - different ribosomal structures than eubacteria - thrive only in environments inhospitable for most living things Thermoacidophiles - live only in acidic hot springs - live either by gaining energy by breaking bonds of sulfur compounds, like H 2 S, or heterotrophically by breaking down organic material in their environment Halophiles - live only in hypersaline conditions (extreme salt) - all are photoautotrophs Methanogens - heterotrophs that produce methane gas from CO 2 and H 2 - free-living in anoxic muds - symbiotic forms live in the guts of animal that need to digest plant cellulose material - important decomposers Kingdom Eubacteria: - prokaryotic - have peptidoglycan in cell walls - may be aerobic or anaerobic - may be autotrophic or heterotrophic Aerobic heterotrophs - live by breaking down all manner of materials for food and energy (organic or inorganic) - most are obligate aerobes, using oxygen as the final electron acceptor in the process of respiration Anaerobic heterotrophs - mostly obligate anaerobes - use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor - a common life style of this group is to use fermentation as the primary means of transforming energy into a useable form Autotrophs - bacteria that carry out photosynthesis without oxygen - bacteria that carry out photosynthesis with oxygen Kingdom Protista: - garbage can kingdom (repository for organisms that do not conveniently match the characteristics of other kingdoms) Algae - photoautotrophic protists Phylum Pyrrophyta (Dinoflagellates) - mostly unicellular, a few can form colonies - two flagellae, one around the equator of the cell, the other down the axis of the cell - use chlorophyll a and c and carotenoids as photosynthetic pigments - some species produce \"red tides\" Phylum Chrysophyta (Golden algae) - single celled and colonial forms exist - produce ornate outer coverings of silica - use chlorophyll a and c and fucoxanthin as photosynthetic pigments - often have two flagellae, unequal in length, that extend out of the cell from the same location - indicator organism of unpolluted water Phylum Euglenophyta - all are unicellular forms - may switch from autotrophy to heterotrophy as needed based on environmental conditions - use chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids for photosynthesis - only one flagellum - no cell wall - indicator organisms of polluted water Phylum Phaeophyta (Brown algae) - multicellular - use chlorophyll a and c and fucoxanthin for photosynthesis - thylakoids in plastids are stacked in triplets, DNA in plastids is in a large loop attached to the plastid membrane - this group contains the largest algae, reaching lengths in excess of 100 m - gametes and spores are flagellated Phylum Rhodophyta (Red algae) - multicellular - use chlorphyll a, phycobilins, and carotenoids for photosynthesis - thylakoids in plastids are single (not stacked at all), DNA in plastids is in small strands distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the plastid - no flagellated cells at all, even spores and gametes are non-flagellated Phylum Chlorophyta (Green algae) - multicellular - use chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids for photosynthesis, DNA in plastids is in small strands dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the plastid - thylakoids in plastids are arranged into grana stacks - gametes and spores are flagellated Protozoa - typically unicellular, motile, \nheterotrophic protists Phylum Rhizopoda (Amoeboids) - move via rhizopoda (also known as pseudopodia) - free-living and parasitic forms exist - engulf food via phagosytosis - populations grow via binary fission, some can form resistant spore-like stages Phylum Foraminifera - produce ornate calcium carbonate shells - engulf food items via phagocytosis - this group has alternation of haploid and dipliod life stages, unlike other protozoans Phylum Sporozoa - sporozoans may be highly reduced multicellular animals, but since they are included with the protists in our text we will consider them to be protists for the sake of convenience - these have complex life cycles involving at least two hosts - all are parasitic - at some stage of the life cycle, multiple cell divisions produce what appear to be spore-like stages that subsequently divide on their own Phylum Ciliophora (Ciliates) - cilia-bearing - bear trichocyts - all are heterotrophic, most are predators, though there are a few parasitic forms Phylum Zoomastigina (Flagellates) - protozoans that use one to many flagellae for locomotion - all are heterotrophic, some are free-living, others are parasitic, some are symbiotic with hosts in which they dwell Cellular Slime Molds Phylum Acrasiomycota - spends part of its life cycle as amoeba-like individual cells that later aggregate and form a multicellular slug, called a \"grex,\" that produces a fruiting body that releases many spores, each of which develop into individual amoeba-like cells - heterotrophic organisms that take in food by phagocytosis - spore, amoeba, and grex cells are all haploid Kingdom Fungi: - eukaryotic - multicellular (with a few exceptions, like yeast) - complete lack of motility during life cycle - cell walls contain chitin (a substance typically produced by animals) - growth occurs by the production of hyphae (stands or extensions of fungal cells), many hyphae growing in a mass is referred to as mycelial growth - all are heterotrophic, most are saprophytic - spores are produced as a result of sexual reproduction, and spores are used as the means of dispersion for this kingdom Phylum Zygomycota (Conjugation fungi) - cells are coenocytic - reproduction occurs when hyphae of complementary (+/-) mating strains meet and form a zygosporangium - the only 2n stage of the life cycle is when syngamy occurs when a zygosproangium is formed Phylum Ascomycota (Sac fungi) - spores are always produced in a little sac (latin = ascus) - perforated cell walls separate cells, so they are technically not coenocytic, though cytoplasm is continuous between adjacent cells - during reproduction, matching mating strains fuse contribute a nucleus to the new cell, but those nuclei do not immediately fuse, thus those cells are dikaryons, the nucleii of dikaryons later fuse producing zygotes that undergo meiosis, producing haploid spores Phylum Basidiomycota (Club fungi) - have perforated septae between cells, so they are not technically coenocytic, though cytoplasm is continuous between neighboring cells - n+n cells are produced when matching mating strains meet, the resulting n+n cells divide and produce many more n+n cells that eventually produce the reproductive structure, nucleii in cells on gills of the reproductive structure fuse to produce zygotes that in turn undergo meiosis producing spores that are released into the environment Phylum Deutoermycota (Imperfect fungi) - garbage can taxon where fungi whose complete life cycle is not known are placed Kingdom Plantae : - eukaryotic - multicellular - photoautotrophic (with the exception of a few predaceous or parasitic forms) - photosynthesis is carried out by using chlorophyll a and b - develop from multi-cellular embryos Division Bryophyta - non-vascular plants - reproduction is by flagellated sperm that swim to eggs housed in the female sporophyte - the zygote develops into an embryo that develops into a sporophyte that grows as a parasite on the gametophyte, that is...in the bryophyte, the sporophyte is a parasite of the gametophye - the sporophyte produces a spores by meiosis Division Pterophyta - vascular plants - reproduction is by swimming sperm that fertilize eggs housed in the parent gametophyte - the life cycle dominated by the sporophyte, the gametophyte is small and persists only long enough to allow fertilization to occur - sporophytes produce spores by meiosis that settle and develop into gametophytes Division Coniferophyta - vascular plants - rely on pollen production for fertilization of eggs (i.e., this group does not require water for getting its reproductive material around like the previous two groups) - sporophytes dominate the life history in this group, gametophytes are extremely small in comparision (being produced or housed in cones -- pollen and eggs from microspores and megaspores) - eggs are not surrounded by plant material, there is no ovary -- so they are exposed to the environment (i.e., naked gametes, or gymnosperms) - zygotes produce seeds complete with a seed coat, embryo, and nutritive material to support early growth after seed germination - produce cones as sites of spore and gametophyte production Division Magnoliopophyta - produces eggs in an ovary in a flower where seeds are protected from the environment - reproduction is dependent on pollen production and dispersal - microspores and pollen are produced on anthers of flowers - megaspores and eggs are produced in ovaries of flowers - there is a \"double fertilization\" with the first fusion producing the zygote that develops into a zygote, and a second fusion producing endosperm for the seed Kingdom Amimalia: - eukaryotic - multicellular - lacks cell walls - development includes gastrulation - heterotrophic Phylum Porifera (Sponges) - has specialized cells, but lacks tissue-level organization - have choanocytes for collecting food - has swimming sperm Phylum Cnidaria (Jellyfishes, coral, Hydra, etc.) - diploblastic construction (gastrovascular tissue lining the gut, and ectoderm that is the outer layer of cells, and there is an acellular matrix between those layers called mesoglea - incomplete digestive tract -- one opening used for feeding and releasing solid waste - have nematocysts (stinging cells) - typically have polyp (sessile) and medusa (jellyfish) life stages that alternate with each other - typically with radial symetry - has tissue grade construction, but typically lacks organ level organization Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatoworms) - triploblastic construction - acoelomate - incomplete digestive tract - bilateral symetry - cephalization - has tissue and organ level organization - protostomous development Phylum Nematoda (Roundworms) - triploblastic - pseudocoelomate, fluid-filled space lackes peritoneum lining - eutly is common - protostomous development - tough outer cuticle - has only longitudinal muscles in the body wall - parasitic and free-living forms - complete digestive \ntract Phylum Annelida (Segmented worms) - triploblastic - eucoelomate - metamerism -- segmentation of the body - closed circulatory system - parasitic and free-living forms - protostomous development Phylum Mollusca (Snails, clams, etc.) - triploblastic - eucoelomate - protostomous development - muscular head/foot - mantle that secretes a shell (most members of the phylum) - most bear a radula -- rasp-like tongue Phylum Arthropoda (Insects, crustaceans, etc.) - triploblastic - eucoelomate - protostomous development - produce a chitinous, sometimes calcified exoskeleton - have jointed appendages - tagmatization (fusion of segments to produce specialized structures) Phylum Echinodermata (Sea urchins, sea stars, etc.) - triploblastic - eucoelomate - deutoerostomous development - produce an endoskeleton - larvae have bilateral symmetry, adults have pentaradial symmetry - no cephalization - have a water vascular system Phylum Chordata (Urochordates, cephalochordates, vertebrates, etc.) - triploblastic - eucoelomate - deutoerostomous development - notochord - hollow dorsal nerve cord - pharyngeal gill slits Subphylum Urochordata - have characteristics of the phylum only in the larval stage - all are filter-feeders Subphylum Cephalochordata - have characteristics of the phylum throughout the life history, but do not develop a vertebral column - all are filter-feeders Subphylum Vertebrata - animals that have a vertebral column of cartilage or bone that protects the spinal cord - have a post-anal tail - pronounced cephalization - advanced kidney structure (compared to kidneys of invertebrates) Class Agnatha - lack jaws - lack paired appendages/fins - have a cartilage skeleton (no bone) - 2 chambered heart Class Chondrichthyes - have a cartilaginous skeleton - have paired fins - external gill openings are separate - no swim bladder - no scales, body typically covered by denticles - various reproductive strategies, mostly internal fertilization - 2-chambered heart Class Osteichthyes - bony skeleton - body typically covered by scales - one external gill opening - has a swim bladder - external fertilization Class Amphibia - aquatic larval stage, terrestrial or semi-terrestrial adult stage - requires water to complete life cycle - small bones and pelvis - larvae with two chambered heart, adults with three chambered heart - glandular skin - poikilothermic Class Reptilia - amniotic egg allows reproduction without water - body covered by scaly skin comprised of keratin - toenails - imperfect four-chambered heart - poikilothermic Class Aves - four chambered heart - body covered by feathers - specializations for flight (fused bones, lack of teeth, etc.) - amniotic egg - endothermic Class Mammalia - four chambered heart - body covered/bearing hair - mothers suckle young with milk produced in the mammary gland - specialized teeth: molars, canines, incisors Recycle me back to the Principles of Biology I home page",1.1057838201522827],["Consider euglenoids , which are one-celled organisms that have both plant- and animal-like characteristics.",1.102708339691162],["A single cell in a multicellular organism has on its surface upwards of 100 different proteins, each of which is there to receive external cues.",1.0977959632873535],["The cells that grouped together to form multicellular organisms had quite different \nadaptive goals to the solitary single-celled organisms from which they evolved.",1.0956648588180542],["The cells that grouped together to form multicellular organisms had quite different adaptive goals to the solitary single-celled organisms from which they evolved.",1.0956648588180542],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary: Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["urinary : Having to do with urine or the organs of the body that produce and get rid of urine.",1.094295620918274],["GENE REGULATION IN EUKARYOTES -
