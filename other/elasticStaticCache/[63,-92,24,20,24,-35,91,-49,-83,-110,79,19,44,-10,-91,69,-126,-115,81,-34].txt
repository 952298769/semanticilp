shade tree usually maturing at about 70' tall by 50' wide, but with the capacity to grow much larger upright oval growth habit in youth, quickly losing its central leader and becoming rounded to irregular in growth habit with age rapid growth rate C ulture full sun (tolerant of partial sun in youth) prefers moist, rich soils but is highly adaptable to many adverse conditions, including wet soils, dry soils, poor soils, compacted soils, rocky soils, soils of various pH, heat, drought, flooding, pollution, and windswept areas species form is propagated primarily by seed, while stem cuttings from cultivars may be grafted onto seedling understock, or they may be rooted Elm Family, with several cosmetic disease (leaf spots, leaf nipple gall), pest (scale), combination (witches' broom), and physiological (leaf chlorosis) problems, none of which seem to significantly slow the species down, and not including Dutch Elm disease, which is restricted to members of the genus Ulmus moderate availability, usually in ball and burlap form often a volunteer tree in very wet or very dry sites, waste sites, fence rows, and cut-over woodlots, which is left because of its convenient quick shade or windbreak function (or it rapidly becomes too big to conveniently cut down) Common Hackberry is somewhat sensitive to being transplanted in Autumn, and care should be taken to amend the soil, fertilize, water thoroughly, mulch adequately, and avoid Winter salt spray, to enhance survival chances during the first Winter F oliage alternate along the stem, medium to dark green, and about 4\" long leaves are ovate, serrated, with an acute to acuminate apex, and with the leaf base asymmetrical (skewed or lop-sided, like the foliage of most Elm Family members) leaf spots and/or nipple
