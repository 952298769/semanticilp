awake so many nights battling with her own mind memories that felt so real and yet couldn't possibly be thoughts of her own father touching her in the most private of places and even her mother took a piece of the white fluff cake and so she grew up and felt all of these urges never knowing why she was so confused and then the other memories those too horrible she herself doing the things that had been done to her just once, just twice then nothing so afraid of doing it again doing it and not remembering love they only love you if you give them what they want he came along she looked up to him with lights shining in her eyes she was blinded by the touch from her father her mother and now he and so she associated all of this to mean love she gave herself mind, body, and soul for him she was willing to live, to die and everything in between then one day another came and he did not want the touch he said &quot;i love you&quot; and that was love but he wouldn't touch and wasn't that love so she wondered through all of this what in the world was love no one had answers so the questions grew she felt the need she felt the hunger the urge the frustration all of these powerful emotions running around the track who what why when going crazy and then it came the gentle hands the kind heart the knowing eyes and the beautiful mouth speaking words that entered her heart and pierced her soul her mind tranquil heavily sedated wallowing in the warmth and dancing within his song so lost to this new feeling so naive to the world then like a flash of lightning it poured down with thunder he said he didn't love her and that he never had she awoke from the dream from the spell she was under once again tossed into the sea once again alone and afraid crying and never understanding why and wondering she needed to feel she needed the love and thus she went back to the touch hurting herself over and over again telling herself it was true love was the touch it had to be if not what could love mean she'd had the fairy tale and he tore the pages right out of that book and so there she sits the channel has once again changed he slowly begins to sew back together the ragged pieces of her heart he hands her back the reigns and tells her to drive on to places where the sun still shines your eyes and your smile will once again dance and play with the music inside find meaning within
