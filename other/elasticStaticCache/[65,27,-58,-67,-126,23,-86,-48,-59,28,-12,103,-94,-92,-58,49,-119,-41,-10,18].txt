messenger system THE MAJOR ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND THEIR HORMONES Endocrine System Composed of Ten Major Organs tbl 49.1 The Posterior Pituitary Gland Pituitary gland is located in brain, below the hypothalamus fig 49.9 Produces nine major hormones Composed of two independently functioning glands Posterior pituitary derived from outgrowth of brain, retains neural connections Anterior pituitary derived from outgrowth of epithelium lining mouth Secretions of the posterior pituitary Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) = vasopressin fig 49.10 Regulates kidney water retention Damage or alcohol causes excessive urination Oxytocin Peptide hormone composed of nine amino acids Stimulates contraction of smooth muscles around mammary glands Initiates milk release with suckling Stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth Both hormones synthesized inside neuron cells in hypothalamus Transported down axons to synapses in pituitary Stored in axon terminals Released into blood stream with nerve stimulus The Anterior Pituitary Gland Initially associated with growth disorders Surgical removal corrects acromegaly fig 49.11 Tumors cause gigantism fig 49.12 Gigantism caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) in growing child Causes acromegaly when skeletal growth plates are sealed in adults Deficiency in childhood causes pituitary dwarfism Pituitary actually synthesizes the hormones it secretes fig 49.13 Many stimulate growth of target organ, including other endocrine glands Are called tropic hormones Summary of hormones secreted by anterior pituitary Growth hormone ( \nGH or somatotropin) Promotes growth directly Stimulates liver to secrete hormones that promote growth of muscle and bone Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH or corticotropin) Stimulates adrenal gland to produce corticosteroid hormones Corticosteroid actions Regulate production of glucose from fat Regulate balance of sodium and potassium in the blood Contribute to non-reproductive male secondary sex characteristics Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Stimulates thyroid to produce thyroid hormone (thyroxin) Thyroxin stimulates oxidative respiration Luteinizing hormone (LH) Plays an important role in the female menstrual cycle Stimulates testes to produce testosterone Testosterone initiates, maintains secondary sex characteristics Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Significant in the female menstrual cycle Stimulates cells in testes, regulates sperm development FSH and LH are both gonadotropins Prolactin (PRL): stimulates breasts to produce milk Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) Stimulates epidermal color changes in reptiles and amphibians No known function in mammals Hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary gland secretion Control is via hormones not nerve impulses Neurons in hypothalamus secrete releasing factors Carried by blood directly to anterior pituitary fig 49.14 Transported inside short blood vessels that connect two beds of capillaries One bed in hypothalamus, other in anterior pituitary Each releasing factor is specific for one tropic hormone Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates release of TSH Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates release of ACTH Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates FSH and LH Also secretes hormones that inhibit release of certain anterior pituitary hormones Somatostatin inhibits secretion of GH Prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH) inhibits secretion of prolactin Melanotropin inhibiting hormone (MIH) inhibits secretion of MSH Travel in blood from hypothalamus directly to anterior pituitary Negative feedback control of anterior pituitary gland secretions Hypothalamus no longer considered to be \"master gland\" Adrenal medulla and pancreas not controlled by this system Hypothalamus and anterior pituitary are themselves controlled by hormones End hormones feed back to regulate glands that control their release fig 49.15 Example: hormonal control of thyroid gland TRH stimulates anterior pituitary to secrete TSH TSH stimulates tyroid to release thyroxine Thyroxine acts on many target organs including Hypothalamus to inhibits TRH secretion Anterior pituitary to inhibit TRH secretion This is an example of negative feedback inhibition Example: insufficient dietary iodine Thyroid cannot produce thyroxine which contains iodine Blood thyroxine levels very low Less feedback inhibition to hypothalamus and anterior pituitary Causes increased secretion of TRH and TSH Stimulates thyroid to grow, but without iodine still no thyroxine Causes an enlarged thyroid, a goiter fig 49.16 The Thyroid Gland: A Metabolic Thermostat Located in front of the neck Produces thyroxine Stimulates oxidative respiration, helps set body's metabolic rate In children, promotes growth and stimulates maturation of nervous system Children with under active thyroids have stunted growth, mental retardation Condition called cretinism Can supplement with oral thyroxine Produces calcitonin If blood Ca++ is too high, calcitonin stimulates its uptake into bones Lowers its level in the blood fig 49.17 The Parathyroid Glands: Regulators of Blood Ca++ Levels Four small glands attached to thyroid Produces parathyroid hormone (PTH) One of two hormones absolutely essential for survival Synthesized and released when Ca++ levels in blood get low Ca++ required for muscle contraction Extreme low levels cause muscle spasms Cause osteoclasts to dissolve bone with subsequent Ca++ release fig 49.17 Reabsorbs calcium from urine Activates vitamin D to absorb Ca++ from intestine Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, poor bone formation The Adrenal Glands: Two Glands in One Adrenal glands located above each kidney Composed of inner adrenal medulla Composed of outer adrenal cortex The adrenal medulla: emergency warning siren With stress medulla produces epinephrine and norepinephrine Stimulates alarm response similar to sympathetic division of autonomic nervous system, but more prolonged Responses: increased blood sugar, faster heartbeat, increased blood pressure, dilated blood vessels in skeletal muscles, increased blood flow to heart and lungs Extension of fight or flight response The adrenal cortex: homeostasis of glucose and Na+ Produces cortisol (hydrocortisone) Maintains glucose homeostasis, thus called glucocorticoids Stimulate breakdown of muscle proteins into amino acids, carried to liver Stimulates liver to produce enzymes to convert amino acids to glucose, gluconeogenesis Important during fasting Modulate some aspects of the immune response Reduces inflammation Produces aldosterone Acts on kidney to promote uptake of Na+ Na+ needed for nerve conduction, blood pressure Prevents excess loss of Na+ and thus water from the urine Loss of salt and water causes fall in blood pressure Promotes excretion of K+ in urine Second hormone necessary for survival The Pancreas: Regulating Energy Balance Located behind the stomach, connected to duodenum by pancreatic duct Also secretes bicarbonate ions and various digestive enzymes Though to be just exocrine until clusters of cells identified Called islets of Langerhans fig 49.18 Diabetes mellitus results from pancreas damage Insulin produced by islets of Langerhans Type I: lack insulin secreting cells Treated with insulin injections Insulin used to come from animals, Now use human insulin from genetically engineered bacteria Type II: too few receptors in target tissue Insulin levels normal or high Must control diet and exercise Islets produce two hormones, interact to regulate glucose fig 49.19 Eating increases blood glucose levels Beta cells produce insulin Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose Glucagon produced by islet alpha cells when glucose levels fall Acts antagonistically to insulin Promotes hydrolysis of glycogen in liver and fat in adipose tissue Other Endocrine Glands Ovaries and testes Produce sex hormones Estrogen, progesterone regulate menstrual cycle Testosterone promote protein synthesis Gastrointestinal tract: secretes hormones involved in food digestion Pineal gland fig 47.24 Secretes melatonin Function in humans not well understood May be involved in inhibition of reproductive system Called third eye, responds to light in fish, amphibians and reptiles Released in response to darkness, may be involved with daily biorhythms Implicated in mood disorders like winter depression Atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) is a small peptide made in heart Stimulates kidney to excrete salt and water in urine Antagonistic to aldosterone
