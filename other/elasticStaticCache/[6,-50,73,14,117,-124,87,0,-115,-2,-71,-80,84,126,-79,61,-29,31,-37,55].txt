between ultimate and proximate factors in establishing timing of migration, breeding, etc understand basic bird behavior, including that related to feeding, breeding, and social interactions

birds know bird topography, general avian feather tract patterns, feather types, feather structure, and how feather colors are determined know the avian skeleton, and its compnent parts, and know what skeletal modifications are adaptations for flight know the anatomy of the pigeon and what departures from the general vertebrate pattern are peculiar to birds and which ones are adaptive to a flying
