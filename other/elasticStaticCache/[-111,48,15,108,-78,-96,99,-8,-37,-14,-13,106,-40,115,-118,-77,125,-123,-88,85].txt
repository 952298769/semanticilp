[["Adaptations permitting prolonged submersion (1 point each, 5 needed for full credit) Extra capillaries in the lungs (more efficient exchange of respiratory gases) Use 3 times as much of the oxygen from a breath of air as do terrestrial mammals (can extract more oxygen, and therefore can supply oxygen to tissues for a longer period of time) Can force almost all air out of the lungs when exhaling (increases the amount of oxygen in the lungs for next breath, which in turn enables them to extract more oxygen from that breath) Twice as high a concentration of red blood cells (can carry more oxygen to body tissues) 2-9 times as much myoglobin in muscle tissue (muscles are more efficient at extracting oxygen from circulatory system) Heart rate drops to half its normal rate during long dives (oxygen use is conserved) During dives, blood is redistributed (also conserves oxygen, so it lasts longer) High tolerance to lactic acid (prevents muscle cramping and allows the animal to go longer between breaths) High tolerance to carbon dioxide (prevents spontaneous breathing underwater when metabolic wastes start to build up) 4.",1.4462435245513916],["If you get one over 10 pounds you
