lay eggs - oviparous forelimbs are wings - usually used for flight endothermic and to some degree homeothermic once flying birds evolved - the ability to fly and the adaptive zone of the air has governed their subsequent evolution keeping birds from changing very much origin of birds the relationship between reptiles and birds has long been known feathers are modified scales - form from the same cell types during embryogenesis scales still present on epidermis of lower hindlimbs real tie came in 1861 with discovery of Archaeopteryx - (meaning ancient wing) this fossil bore the unmistakable imprint of feathers the origin of feathers has been debated a lot one theory is that they originally evolved as a way to aid in regulating body temperature later - wings evolved due to alterations in the expression of Hox genes similar alterations occurred with the Pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) and mammals (bats) by already having feathers, the early lineages of birds could readily take to flight Class Aves two original groupings flightless - ratite sternum is flat flying - carinate sternum forms a keel now realize that not all flightless birds fit into ratite category and vice versa modern classification is based on the way the palate is formed and whether it remains jointed and flexible or is a fused joint and inflexible Superorder Paleognathae inflexible fused palate most are flightless birds - ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, emus, and kiwis Superorder Neognathae - jointed, flexible palate 22 orders refer to orders in text and in lab manual know the orders in the lab
