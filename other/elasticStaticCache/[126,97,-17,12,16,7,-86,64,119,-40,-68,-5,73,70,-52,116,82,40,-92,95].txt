concepts with history and scientists Life Science Observe and describe habitats within ecosystems Observe and identify organisms with similar needs that compete for resources Describe environmental changes which cause organisms to thrive, become ill, or perish Describe how living organisms modify their physical environment to meet their needs Observe, identify and analyze characteristics among species that allow each to survive and reproduce Identify some inherited traits of plants and animals Observe and identify simple systems and describe the roles of various parts Earth Science Identify and describe the importance of earth materials including rocks, soil, water and gases and classify as renewable, nonrenewable or inexhaustible resources Identify and record properties of soils Identify the planets in our Solar system and their position in relation to the Sun Describe the characteristics of the Sun Identify that the surface of the Earth can be changed by forces Physical Science Measure and record changes in the position and direction of the motion of an object to which a force is applied Gather information including temperature, magnetism, hardness and mass using appropriate tools to identify properties of matter Identify matter as solids, liquids, or gases Fourth Grade Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices during field and laboratory investigations Use and conserve resources and dispose of or recycle materials Use tools to collect and analyze information Demonstrate that repeated investigations increase reliability of results Plan and implement descriptive investigations- ask well-defined questions, formulate hypothesis, select and use equipment and technology Analyze and interpret information to construct explanations from direct and indirect evidence Communicate valid conclusions Construct graphs, tables, maps, and charts to organize, examine, and evaluate information Analyze, review, critique scientific explanations: hypotheses,
