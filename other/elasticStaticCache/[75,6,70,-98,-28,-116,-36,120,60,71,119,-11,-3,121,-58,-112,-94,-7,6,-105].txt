of waves pass by wave length and height depend on wind velocity duration of wind from a constant direction fetch: the length of water over which the wind is passing therefore the large, long duration storms produce the largest waves, typically 15 m in height , but up to 34 m Surf breaking waves in the shorezone (foreshore) as waves drag on the sea floor in the foreshore, the waves decelerate
