of cells only visible under the light microscope when a cell is actively dividing all cells of the body (with the exception of the reproductive cells - eggs &amp; sperm) contain the exact same number of chromosomes all members of the same species have the same number of chromosomes in their cells each chromosome has a compliment - another chromosome of the same size and shape that carries information on the same characteristics of the organism - these pairs of chromosomes are called homologous pairs of chromosomes Structure of chromosomes during one phase of mitosis, called Metaphase, each chromosome appears as two strands connected together at one spot the strands are called chromatids the point of attachment is called the centromere during Metaphase the chromosomes are the most visible if a cell is smashed during this phase of mitosis, the individual chromosomes are randomly spread out to enable viewing of individual chromosomes a photograph can be taken of the chromosomes and enlarged to show even more detail these enlarged chromosomes can be cut out and arranged into their homologous pairs by matching up those that are the same size, shape, and have the centromere located in the same spot along the length of the chromosome the result is a karotype - a precise ordering and pairing of the chromosomes of a cell B] HUMAN CHROMOSOMES Normal humans have a total of 46 chromosomes 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes 22 of these pairs are found in both males and females - the autosomes 1 pair is different in males vs. females - the sex chromosomes females have 2 chromosomes \nthat look alike and are designated the X chromosomes males have one of the X chromosomes and a unique chromosome found only in males and smaller than the X, it is called the Y chromosome therefore, males can be designated XY and females XX Chromosomal abnormalities normally, if a fertilized egg has one too many or one too few chromosomes, a human will not develop in a few cases, a human will develop even if the fertilized egg has a wrong number of chromosomes Down syndrome - caused by having one extra autosome, caused by an extra copy of chromosome #21 (one of the smallest human chromosomes) distinct facial features and different degrees of mental retardation are associated with this syndrome Kleinfelter syndrome - caused by having an extra sex chromosome sex chromosomes = XXY has a penis, but may develop secondary sexual characteristics of females (e.g. breast development) usually does not affect intelligence C] PATTERNS OF INHERITANCE Autosomal dominant
