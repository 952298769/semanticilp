[["Organic activity activities of plants and burrowing animals can cause a rock material to disintegrate click here to see tree roots causing rocks to disintegrate B. Chemical weathering is the breakdown of a substance by decomposition resulting in the formation of new mineral matter--water and acids especially carbonic acid (H2CO3) are important agents in this type of weathering Kinds of chemical weathering hydrolysis--is the chemical reaction of water with the substance in which the (OH) in water (HOH) becomes part of the new formed substance-- often silicate minerals will weather this way to form clays solution (leaching)--is the dissolving of substances by acid in waters usually leaving residual nonsolubilized materials--carbonate minerals are especially affected by leaching oxidation--is the reaction of a substance with oxygen causing a rust to form--manganese (Mn) and especially iron (Fe) minerals are affected although there are individual chemical and physical weathering types often combinations of these can affect the total weathering of a substance III.",1.2894799709320068],["Chemical weathering happens when substances like water or acids get into rock and react with the minerals that make up the rock.",1.143538475036621],["Chemical weathering happens when substances like water or acids get into rock and react with the minerals that make up the rock.",1.143538475036621],["by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances?",1.1289793252944946],["by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances?",1.1289793252944946],["by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances?",1.1289793252944946],["by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances?",1.1289793252944946],["by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances?",1.1289793252944946],["So, when a mineral forms – whether from molten rock, or from substances dissolved in water – it will be initially argon-free, even if there is some argon in the liquid.",1.1002148389816284],["\"I happen to have with me a pair of bottles containing a substance which, if dissolved in water, and sprinkled on this rock, will disintegrate it.",1.0589649677276611],["It constitutes a fifth part of our atmosphere, a third part of water, and a large proportion of every kind of rock in the crust of the earth Hydrogen, which forms two-thirds of water, and enters into some mineral substances, is perhaps next.",1.0201612710952759],["Magma is a molten mixture of rock forming substances, gases, and water from the mantle.",1.0140438079833984],["Sedimentary rocks, most of which were formed by the settling of their substance as sediment from bodies of water such as streams lakes, and \nthe sea.",1.0082159042358398],["Water is perhaps the most powerful agent of chemical weathering: Over time, it can dissolve many kinds of rocks into a solution that has a different chemical makeup than the original substance.",0.997898519039154],["Rocks may be composed of many different substances which can be identified when the rocks are broken down.",0.9777716398239136],["Water can seep into small cracks in a rock or other substance.",0.9716407656669617]]
