---------------------------- Scale insects are a common pest of houseplants and can be found stunting and deforming plants throughout the year Any of several different species of scale insects may be found on plants in the home or greenhouse They all have in common a waxy or shell-like covering over the body of the sessile insect Most scales are tan or brown and vary from 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter Scales may be found on the stems and/or leaves Some scales are hemispherical in shape, while others are oval and flat Scale insects feed on plant sap sucked thorough a slender stylet that remains inserted constantly into the plant tissue More commonly noticed than the scales is the large quantity of a sweet sticky liquid called honeydew that is excreted by the scale insects Scale insects are often difficult to control There are several well-known remedies that can be tried in an attempt to eliminate scales from a houseplant Aerosol or hand pump insecticide sprays made just for houseplants are available at garden centers Formulated active ingredients include insecticidal soaps, pyrethrin, rotenone, resmethrin and acephate You can use a mild dish washing detergent in place of the commercial insecticide soaps Insecticides must be applied thoroughly, repeatedly and persistently (weekly for a month or more) to get good control 2 .",1.8490805625915527],["Like most other
