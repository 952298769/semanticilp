Grounding is the major cause of oil spills from vessels (26%) followed by collision (22%), explosion or fire (9%), ramming (9%) sinking (7%) with human error (5%) and mechanical failure (2%) causing the least number of spills [1]. There is a continuous effort from the concerned organizations to reduce the risk of oil spills by the introduction of strict new legislation, operating codes as well as new operating and maintenance procedures to minimize accidents that may lead to spills. A comparison of oil spill incidents in world and Indian waters shown in figure 1, reveals that the spill trends in India has been increased many fold during the last few decades thereby creating various environmental problems. When oil is spilled on water, a number of transformation processes occur that are referred as the ï¿½behaviourï¿½ of oil and the specific behaviour processes determine its effect on the environment. For example, if oil evaporates rapidly, cleanup is less intense, but the hydrocarbons in the oil enter the atmosphere and cause air pollution. An oil slick could be carried by surface currents or winds to a bird colony or to a shore where seals or sea lions are breeding and severely affect the wildlife and their habitat. The behaviour processes are almost entirely determined by the type of oil and the environmental conditions at the time of the spill.",1.4883661270141602],["Potential impacts: oil spill possibility will increase with greater amount of traffic in the area.",1.484985589981079],["While the amount of activity and therefore the risk of oil spills is increasing, cooperation between relevant groups has resulted in the development of oil spill prevention and contingency plans for those areas most at risk.",1.392128825187683],["When oil is spilled into the marine environment, the growth of indigenous microbes is stimulated as increased amounts of carbon in the oil provide food for the microbes.",1.365142822265625],["When oil is spilled into the marine environment, the growth of indigenous microbes is stimulated as increased amounts of carbon in the oil provide food for the microbes.",1.365142822265625],["Use of dispersants may decrease effects of oil spills on plants and animals that live on the water surface, but may increase negative effects on organisms living in or on the bottom of waterbodies.",1.3616100549697876]]
