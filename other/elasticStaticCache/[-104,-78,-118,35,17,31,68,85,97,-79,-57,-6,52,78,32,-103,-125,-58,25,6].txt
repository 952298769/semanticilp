Poetically however it is sometimes useful to use a metaphor and think of an inanimate but complex system as being 'alive'. This is useful analogy because some natural systems are very complex and so are living systems. A river is a complex system because it responds to external perturbations (minor upsets) in complex ways. For example, if one dumps a lot of sand into a river, the river will change its course over time in such a way as to come back to an equilibrium (stable) configuration. This is similar to for example the way the internal processes within your body regulate the temperature: when its hot out you sweat and evaporation of sweat tends to cool you. If its cold out you get goose bumps and your blood circulation slows down to conserve your body heat.
