causing water pores to be inserted in the collecting duct of the kidney Aldosterone increases Na reabsorption by the kidney (distal tubule) Secretion of these hormones is controlled by feedback loops: if the blood osmotic pressure is too high ADH secretion is increased if the blood volume falls aldosterone will increase (this involves 2 more hormones, renin and angiotensin which are not on the
