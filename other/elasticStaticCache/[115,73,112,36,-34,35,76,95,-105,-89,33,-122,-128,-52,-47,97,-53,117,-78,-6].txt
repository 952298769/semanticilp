The hens talk to their eggs, including purring and other sounds, which can help the chicks recognize their mother_s voice after they hatch.

These are located predominantly on the legs, but also on the skin. They feel vibrations of the ground and in the atmosphere, which help them to recognize enemies very quickly. You can notice it if you quietly approach your hen house in the darkness. Immediately you can hear the warning voice of the rooster. Since chickens are able to express over 30 different sounds, they also have a very good sense of hearing. This can be observed already with the communication between hen and chick, about 24 hours before hatching out. The chick chirps with long, high sounds and the hen answers with a deep, soft voice. Hen and chick can still understand each other at a distance of 20 meters, and the chicken chirps when it gets lost. At this distance chicks are able to recognize their mothers voice out of a lot of other sounds. When there is food for the chicks or they are allowed to slip under their mothers feathers, they chirp quite softly because they feel good. The chicks also communicate with each other. But they don't react if any of their brothers and sisters gets lost.",1.3763036727905273],["When a kangaroo senses danger, it alerts its fellows by thumping its feet loudly on the ground!
