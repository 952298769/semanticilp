for transport of sediment to the deep sea Bulk emplacement large quantities delivered in a single mass, involves mostly terrigenous sediment Settling from surface water involves biogenic sediment and fine (windblown) terrigenous and volcanigenic sediment (ash) Growth of minerals in place ferromanganese nodules, sulphides, phosphates Bulk emplacement of sediments to the deep sea During lowstands, sediment carried to shelf edge Buildup of sediment causes slope instability and slope failure Under influence of gravity, material is moved downslope Slumping movement of material downslope as a coherent mass, little internal deformation Flow of sediment-water slurries Internal bedding structures destroyed Turbidity currents Turbidites form when sediment is resuspended and mixed with water Mixture is dense, is pulled downslope under influence of gravity Often triggered by earthquakes Deposits of turbidity currents = turbidite Characterised by graded bedding (fining of grain size from base to top of deposit) Most turbidites associated with submarine canyons, which serve as chutes Turbidite deposits occur primarily at the mouths of submarine canyons, where they form thick, cone-shaped deposits called deep sea fans Grand Banks Earthquake and discovery of turbidity currents Ice rafting and deposition of glacimarine sediments Ice shelves can disintegrate into ice bergs, which float away Upon melting, release their sediment load Deposits characterised by poor sorting Pelagic deposition (settling of sediment from surface water) Sources Windblown dust from continents Major contributor is Africa Volcanic ash Ash carried to stratosphere and disseminated Blocks out solar radiation, gives rise to global cooling Biological remains (skeletal debris) from surface waters Types of biogenic pelagic sediment Based on chemical composition, two types of deposits: Calcareous oozes (CaCO3) chalk when lithified Remains of Phytoplankton single-celled plants (coccolithophores) Skeletons of Zooplankton single-celled animals (foraminifera) Siliceous oozes (SiO2) chert when lithified Remains of phytoplankton (diatoms) Remains of Zooplankton (radiolaria) Distribution of siliceous ooze and calcareous ooze Controlled by ocean chemistry Silica dissolution is greatest in surface waters and decreases in the colder, more acidic deep waters of the ocean High productivity of
