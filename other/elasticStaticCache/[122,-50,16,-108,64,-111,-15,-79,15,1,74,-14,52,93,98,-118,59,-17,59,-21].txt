biogeochemical activities of microorganisms have altered the conditions of the Earth - early atmosphere had no oxygen and was probably dominated by N 2 , NH 3 , CO 2 and CH 3 - through primitive biogeochemical processes which were uni-directional (not cyclic) - early life forms which were microbial changed the chemical nature of the Earth's atmosphere form a reducing (anaerobic) atmosphere to an oxidizing (aerobic) atmosphere which favoured the development of more complex life forms - early heterotrophs decomposed abiotically formed organic matter - early photoautotrophs ((e.g. cyanobacteria) produced oxygen through photosynthesis which accumulated in the atmosphere creating aerobic conditions - when steady-state conditions resembling a 'dynamic equilibrium' became established with the development of more life forms with more diverse metabolic capabilities - the Earth's biogeochemical processes became cyclic - Figure 1.2 - shows some of the major changes in the Earth's history and the important \nrole of microorganisms in those changes - discussion of cycling of individual elements is artificial - biogeochemical cycles are all inter-connected and cannot really be separated from each other Elements to be considered : (i) hydrogen (ii) carbon (iii) oxygen (iv) nitrogen (v) phosphorus (vi) sulfur (vii) iron (viii) manganese (ix) calcium (x) silicon -

for very long time periods hydrogen is stored in fossil fuel reserves - unavailable for cycling until released during combustion cycling of hydrogen is very slow because of these very large reservoirs -
