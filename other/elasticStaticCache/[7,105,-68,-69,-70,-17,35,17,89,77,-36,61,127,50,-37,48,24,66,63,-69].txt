luteinizing hormone, stimulates development of testes and ovaries Graphic of Ant.",2.2837939262390137],["The chemical, bisphenol A, is thought \nto be an endocrine disrupter, which can upset hormone systems in humans and other animals.",2.279646396636963],["Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the endocrine system.",2.279646396636963],["Findings showed detrimental effects on the nervous, immune, and endocrine (hormone) systems which has direct implications for humans.",2.279646396636963],["Endocrine organs make hormones .",2.266927480697632],["Within the Endocrine System there are literally hundreds of types of hormones produced, some of which merely stimulate the release of still larger even more pronounced hormones.",2.26102876663208],["Within the Endocrine System there are literally hundreds of types of hormones produced, some of which merely stimulate the release of still larger even more pronounced hormones.",2.26102876663208],["The endocrine system consists of specific organs and tissues which function to manufacture and release chemicals called hormones.",2.2515759468078613],["The endocrine system is made up of glands which regulate tissue and organ function, growth and development by secreting chemicals called hormones.",2.2515759468078613],["68) The Endocrine System This system is controlled by chemicals produced in the body called Hormones .",2.243839740753174],["Emphasis will be placed on general aspects of endocrine physiology, the organization of the endocrine system, mechanisms of hormone action, and control of endocrine secretion.",2.2390828132629395],["Emphasis will be placed on general aspects of endocrine physiology, the organization of the endocrine system, mechanisms of hormone action, and control of endocrine secretion.",2.2390828132629395],["All hormones in the human body are produced by endocrine, or ductless glands.",2.2384564876556396],["Interference with the endocrine system--which regulates hormonal activity in people and wildlife--is the effect most frequently associated with synthetic organic contaminants found in many industrial and agricultural chemicals.",2.220092535018921],["Interference with the endocrine system, \nwhich regulates hormonal activity in people and wildlife, is the effect most frequently associated with synthetic organic contaminants found in many industrial and agricultural chemicals.",2.220092535018921],["First, the major endocrine organs and the hormones they produce are introduced, with delineation of major effects.",2.210386037826538],["It is also an endocrine organ that produces thymulin, a hormone also involved in lymphocyte differentiation.",2.210386037826538],["The medulla operates as an endocrine organ producing two hormones: adrenaline and noradrenaline.",2.210386037826538],["The Endocrine System and Steroid Hormones.",2.2017569541931152],["Endocrinology : Hormones and endocrine system.",2.2017569541931152],["endocrine system (sexual hormones).",2.2017569541931152],["Hormones and the Endocrine System 22.",2.2017569541931152],["endocrine system (glands, hormones).",2.2017569541931152],["The endocrine system and hormones 11.",2.2017569541931152],["Hormones are the chemicals secreted mostly by the 'endocrine' glands which travel in the bloodstream to control the body's systems.",2.2005844116210938],["Ad Info Site Map About Us Conditions &gt; Encyclopedia &gt; Aging changes in hormone production Aging changes in hormone production Information: BACKGROUND The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones.",2.1843390464782715],["home &gt; Special Topic &gt; A &gt; Aging changes in hormone production Aging changes in hormone production Overview Information The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones.",2.1843390464782715],["home &gt; SpecialTopic &gt; A &gt; Aging changes in hormone production Aging changes in hormone production Overview Information BACKGROUND The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones.",2.1843390464782715],["home &gt; SpecialTopic &gt; A &gt; Aging changes in hormone production Aging changes in hormone production Overview Information BACKGROUND The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones.",2.1843390464782715]]
