Artic animals adapt to the cold tundra. Adapting means the tundra animals are getting used to there biome. Sea mammals such as seals and walruses have blubber to keep warm. Land mammals have thick fur. Lemmings hibernate and are inactive during winter. That’s how the ecosystem works in this Artic tundra.

Some combine cryptic coloring with the actual details of the leaves, bark or plants on which they live, forming a disguise. Some animals develop a color pattern, like spots, zigzags or stripes to hide the outline of their bodies or blend in with dappled light, irregular bark or tall grass. Some animals mimic the body coloring or actions of poisonous or bad tasting prey to benefit from that protection. Some animals enlarge themselves to discourage predators. Others try to startle a predator with a loud hiss, a flash of color or leaping. This is adaptive behavior. Sometimes physical adaptations help animals survive in their habitat.

Hopping up on their hind legs like a kangaroo, they can …reach speeds of 64 km. per hour. The hare can swim across narrow streams. Arctic hares are fast and can bound at speeds of up to 40 miles (60 kilometres) an hour, because of the bone structure and their long limbs, they are able to do this. If you look at the hind limbs they are bent as if crouched down. This structure makes it easier for the animal to jump and hop because they act like a spring. The arched spine also helps the hare with hopping along because it makes it flexible and the structure is adapted to help it hop and jump instead of walk or run. Feet/limbs - · The claws on the front feet of the Arctic hare are long. The strong claws are used for digging in hard-packed snow. Their feet are thickly padded with fur to keep them warm from the snow, and to make them bigger to assist their digging/burrowing ability. Arctic hares have long claws that help them dig through the snow to find food. Their long, muscular legs make them exceptionally fast runners. Fur - · The Arctic hare's coat grows longer and thicker for the winter. They have a short thick undercoat protected by a longer top coat. The white fur makes the hare difficult to spot in the snow.

DRAFT April 10, 2014 66 chicken use their beaks and bills in getting food. Grasshoppers and spiders make use of their legs to get food. Different animals eat different types of food. Some animals have teeth and some others do not. Some animals have different types of teeth for food- getting. Some animals have sharp teeth or incisors for gnawing like the rats, hamsters, and rabbits. These incisors grow continuously. They are worn down through constant gnawing. When gnawing is prevented, the incisors grow so long that the animals cannot eat and die of hunger. The cats and dogs have smaller incisors but bigger canine teeth. These canine teeth are also called fangs. They use their fangs for tearing meat and their molars for chopping the meat into smaller portions so they would be small enough to swallow. The horses, sheep, and cows have more closely spaced and even – sized teeth. These work well in clipping off grasses and plant leaves. Animals have body parts which they use to protect themselves from weather and their enemies. All animals have skin to protect their bodies from different kinds of weather. Turtles, crabs, and lobsters have shells or carapace for protection from hard objects and attacks from enemies. Birds have feathers for protection from different weather conditions. Fish have scales to protect themselves. Insects have feelers or antennas that help them find their way. Cockroaches come out at night and use long feelers in the dark. Porcupines have spikes all over their body for protection against attackers. Some animals like polar bears have thick hair or fur for protection against cold weather. Cows, deer and carabaos have horns for protection against enemies. Some parts protect animals. The turtle hides inside its shell if it is in danger. The thick furs of polar bears protect it from the very cold climate in areas with snow. The habitat is the specific environment or place where an animal lives. There are different kinds of habitats. There are animals that live on land like cows and dogs. There are animals that live in water. There are different kinds of fish. They have gills for breathing under water and fins for swimming. Some live underground like ants, worms, and moles. Others live in high places like birds. They have wings for flying. There are those animals that can live on both land and water. These are the turtles, frogs, and crocodiles. Animals that live in the forest include lions, tigers, deer and large birds. There are animals that also live in the farm. These are the cows, carabaos, chickens, and goats. Some live in the house as pets. These are the dogs, cats, and rabbits.
