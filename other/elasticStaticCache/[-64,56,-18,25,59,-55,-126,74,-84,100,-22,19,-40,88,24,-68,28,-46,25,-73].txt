wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp;

broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",0.9042336344718933],["EXPERIMENT DESIGN The constants in this study were: -the location of each container -the size of each container (165 ml) -the type of plant ( Peperomia ) -amount of water each plant received every other day (15 ml) -each plants growing time (2 weeks) -the type of each container (Plastic cups) -the size of each plant shoot -temperature where plants are growing The manipulated variable was to find out in which condition plant shoots grow roots best.",0.9023773670196533],["However, soil scientists have found that plants generally need a small amount of acidity in the soil to grow well.",0.8999108672142029],["The stream hosts just five native plants, scientists found.",0.8984479904174805],["Arabidopsis is \na small, fast-growing plant widely studied by plant scientists.",0.8965802192687988],["scientists in the People's Republic of China investigate only plants growing in China;",0.8901700973510742],["scientists in the Soviet Union investigate only plants growing in the Soviet Union;",0.8901700973510742],["Scientists in Japan investigate plants growing only in Japan as a source of drugs;",0.8901700973510742],["Use of native desert plants for survival will be discussed and examined.",0.887564480304718],["D 3-d picture with excellent description - Scientists using information to study dust storm and sand dunes Glen Canyon NRA Home Page This Park includes Lake Powell in Arizona - Good information Death Valley Personal narrative about trip to Death Valley Death Valley National Park Wonderful description of park including plant/animal adaptations to life in harsh desert environment Joshua Tree National Park Great description of beauty of desert as well as things to do in this National Park Joshua Tree Slide Show Pictures with descriptions of life in desert park Saguaro National Park Description of this National Park in Arizona Includes good description of Saguaro Cactus Carlsbad Caverns National Park This National Park is located in the Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico Tonto National Forest Large national forest in Arizona includes desert and mountains Petrified Forest National Park gives history description of petrified forest-geologial Visit to Southern Calif. deserts Voyage to Another Universe Great summary of trip to southern Calif. desert by U.Mass prof.

introduced into bacteria Bacteria reproduce making identical replicas Each cell line maintained separately Whole set constitutes clone library of original DNA Stage 4: Screening Identify clone line containing fragment of interest Among most difficult and critical steps Preliminary Screening of Clones Eliminate bacteria not containing proper DNA fragment Use genes conferring antibiotic resistance
