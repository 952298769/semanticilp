5 Kindergarten Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices at home and school Use and conserve resources and materials Use senses as tools of observation Ask questions and base observations on information Plan and conduct simple descriptive investigations Justify merits of decisions Explain a problem and propose a solution Life Science Sort organisms and objects into groups Record observations about plant parts and animal parts Identify parts that, when separated from the whole, may not work Identify basic needs of organisms Give examples of how organisms depend on each other Identify ways Earth provides resources for life Identify and group organisms and objects as living or nonliving Observe and record stages in life cycles Earth Science Observe and describe properties of rocks, soil and water and give examples of how they are useful Observe and identify patterns including seasons, growth, and day and night Physical Science Manipulate parts of objects that when put together can do things they cannot do by themselves Describe properties of objects and characteristics of organisms Observe, describe, and record changes in size, mass, color, position, quantity, time, temperature, sound, and movement Identify that heat causes change, and compare objects according to temperature First Grade Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices at home and school Use and conserve resources and materials Collect information using simple tools- extend senses Record and compare information using standard and non-standard units Plan and conduct simple descriptive investigations, communicate findings and base explanations on information Life Science Identify characteristics of living organisms that allow their needs to be met Compare examples of how organisms depend on each other for basic needs Observe and describe the parts of plants and animals Group and compare living organisms and nonliving objects Observe and record changes in the life cycle of organisms Earth Science Identify and describe natural sources of water Observe and describe differences in rock and soil samples Identify how rocks, soil and water are used and recycled Sort objects by properties and patterns Identify, predict and create patterns Observe and record changes in weather (daily, seasonal) Sort organisms and objects according to parts and patterns Physical Science Identify parts that put together do new things Manipulate objects, separate parts from the whole Identify parts that, when put together, can do new things Identify and test ways heat causes change Observe, measure and record changes in size, mass, color, position, quantity, sound and movement Second Grade Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices at home and school Use and conserve resources and dispose of materials Use tools to collect information and to extend the senses Use standard and non-standard units to measure and compare Plan and conduct simple \ndescriptive investigations and compare results with knowledge and scientists Draw conclusions based on information and explanations Explain a problem and propose a solution Make decisions and justify its merits using information Life Science Identify external characteristics of plants animals that allow basic needs to be met Compare examples of ways organism depend on each other and their environments Manipulate, predict, identify parts separated from whole may not work or when put do new things Observe and record functions of plant and animals parts Identify characteristics of living organisms and nonliving objects Classify and sequence organisms, objects, and events based on properties and patterns Earth Science Describe and illustrate the water cycle Identify uses of natural resources Observe, measure, record changes in weather, night sky, seasons Identify, predict, replicate, and create patterns including those seen in charts, graphs, and numbers Physical Science Observe, measure, record, analyze, predict, illustrate changes in size, mass, temperature, color, position, quantity, sound, movement Identify, predict, test uses of heat to cause changes Demonstrate change in motion of objects push and pull Third Grade Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices during field and laboratory investigations Use and conserve resources and dispose of or recycle materials Use tools to collect and analyze information Demonstrate repeated investigations increase reliability of results Communicate valid conclusions Construct graphs, tables, maps, charts to organize, examine, evaluate information Analyze, review, critique scientific explanations as to strengths and weaknesses Represent natural world using models, identify limitations Evaluate research and connect science concepts with history and scientists Life Science Observe and describe habitats within ecosystems Observe and identify organisms with similar needs that compete for resources Describe environmental changes which cause organisms to thrive, become ill, or perish Describe how living organisms modify their physical environment to meet their needs Observe, identify and analyze characteristics among species that allow each to survive and reproduce Identify some inherited traits of plants and animals Observe and identify simple systems and describe the roles of various parts Earth Science Identify and describe the importance of earth materials including rocks, soil, water and gases and classify as renewable, nonrenewable or inexhaustible resources Identify and record properties of soils Identify the planets in our Solar system and their position in relation to the Sun Describe the characteristics of the Sun Identify that the surface of the Earth can be changed by forces Physical Science Measure and record changes in the position and direction of the motion of an object to which a force is applied Gather information including temperature, magnetism, hardness and mass using appropriate tools to identify properties of matter Identify matter as solids, liquids, or gases Fourth Grade Scientific Processes Demonstrate safe practices during field and laboratory investigations Use and conserve resources and dispose of or recycle materials Use tools to collect and analyze information Demonstrate that repeated investigations increase reliability of results Plan and implement descriptive investigations- ask well-defined questions, formulate hypothesis, select and use equipment and technology Analyze and interpret information to construct explanations from direct and indirect evidence Communicate valid conclusions Construct graphs, tables, maps, and charts to organize, examine, and evaluate information Analyze, review, critique scientific explanations: hypotheses, theories as to strengths and weakness Draw inferences on promotional materials Represent natural world using models;",0.8590344786643982],["( 11 ) And while here I use the tools of comparative
