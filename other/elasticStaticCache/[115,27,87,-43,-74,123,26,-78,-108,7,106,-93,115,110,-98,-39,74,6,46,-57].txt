room so that the shapes blend into background, do not hide butterfly shapes, they should be in plain sight Make some butterflies easier to see than others so that students can discuss the difference

must stay in that place Predator removes blindfold and looks for prey, predator must stay in the same place and is only allowed to look around When predator spots the prey he/she points and calls out their name The prey is then out and must come and sit down next to the predator without talking After five minutes, if the predator has not found all the prey the blindfold is put back on the predator and the prey has to move 10 steps closer The blindfold is taken off again if at this time the predator cannot find the prey the game is over The last prey not found becomes the predator A new game
