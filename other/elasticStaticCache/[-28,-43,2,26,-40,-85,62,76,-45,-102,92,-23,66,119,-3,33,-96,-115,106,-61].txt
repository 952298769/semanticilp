fall) The mechanism of photoperiodism depends on an internal \"clock\" that lets plants know how long the night is clock is based on special pigment called phytochrome Phytochrome comes in two forms: Phytochrome \"far red\" ( P fr ) is the active form (i.e., this is the form that affects plant development promotes flowering in long-day plants inhibits flowering in short-day plants Phytochrome \"red\" ( P r ) is the inactive form during the day, the red light in sunlight converts P r to P fr (so P fr accumulates during the day) at night, P fr slowly converts back to P r Plant \"measures\" night length by amount of P fr in spring/summer when nights are short, P fr is abundant (because not much is broken down) long-day plants are stimulated to flower short-day plants are inhibited from flowering in fall, when nights are long, P fr levels are low long-day plants are inhibited from flowering short-day plants are able to flower (because they're not being inhibited by high levels of P fr ) How do we know that it's night length, not day length, that counts?",1.1962858438491821],["Plants in containers dry out more quickly and should be deeply watered and moved away from direct sunlight.",1.1904692649841309],["Use a diffuser curtain to reduce the amount of direct sunlight hitting the plant, or move it further away from the window.",1.1866698265075684],["Use blinds or sheer curtains to soften strong sunlight, or simply move your plants a few feet back from the window.",1.1866698265075684],["Use blinds or sheer curtains to soften strong sunlight, or simply move your plants a few feet back from the window.",1.1866698265075684],["plants take sunlight and water and break the water via the sunlight into hydrogen and oxygen;",1.1787410974502563],["Also be sure never to get water on a plant in direct sunlight.",1.1766324043273926],["Sediments will settle on corals and plants and will reduce the amount of sunlight and fresh water they get.",1.1766324043273926],["Then plant them where they get the sunlight, soil conditions and water they need to thrive.",1.1766324043273926],["The sunlight reaching the pond can and should be reduced by using surface plants like water-lilies and water hyacinth.",1.1765583753585815],["For maximum flowering, the plant needs sunlight in early spring.",1.1761044263839722],["When plant is flowering, keep it out of direct sunlight.",1.1761044263839722],["flowering plants generally need some direct sunlight;",1.1761044263839722],["Plant in full sunlight for best flower production.",1.1761044263839722],["Notes how the seasonal availability of water, warmth and sunlight influences plant activity.",1.1750295162200928],["What types of plants are used?, what types of pollutants are treated in this manner?, do certain types of soils show the better results in phytoremediation?, how much sunlight and/or water do the plants need for phytoremediation to be effective?,etc.",1.1706583499908447],["I moved my bed and then rearranged all of my plants so they could get an optimum amount of sunlight.",1.1687206029891968],["only within the top 50 to 150 meters of water do these plants get enough sunlight to grow.",1.167595624923706],["Do not move plants immediately into direct sunlight for they will sunburn and be severely damaged.",1.1608712673187256],["While plants are able to make their own food by photosynthesis they need sunlight and water to do so.",1.1580233573913574],["Just water them daily, and plant them somewhere where they can get plenty of sunlight.",1.157143473625183],["4) Select low water use plants Xeriscape gardening uses a &quot;zone&quot; planting concept -
