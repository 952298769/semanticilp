Ecologists classify living things (plants, animals, fungi, and microbes) as biotic while nonliving factors are classified as abiotic. It’s important to note the difference between dead and nonliving parts of the environment. If something is dead, it had to have once been alive, and is thus classified as biotic. Nonliving factors were never alive. Even after death, plants and animals can be homes, food sources, or provide other benefits to the living things in their habitat. All of the biotic and abiotic factors within a wild habitat like Yellowstone affect each other in many different ways, creating a complex interconnected ecosystem. There is so much life in a place like Yellowstone National Park because all of its living and nonliving parts are protected. Water and wildlife are closely linked, and so are the humans that share the environment with them.",1.2193560600280762],["A nonliving living thing.
