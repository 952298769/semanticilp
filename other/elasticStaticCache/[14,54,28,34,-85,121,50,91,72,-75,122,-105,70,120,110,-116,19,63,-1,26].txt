Key Factor Analysis we often wish to know the specific cause(s) of observed fluctuations in the size/density of populations in the field &#151; this can point to ways of controlling pests or increasing the numbers of endangered species, for example one method that has been applied here is key factor analysis &#151; first applied to study of univoltine (&quot;annual&quot;) insects (spruce budworm) by Morris (1957) construct a life table for each year &#151; use stages (adult, egg, larva, pupa, adult) instead of age classes: calculate k values for each life stage transition &#151; k = instantaneous mortality coefficient: k = log(N s ) - log(N e ) where k = instantaneous mortality coefficient N s = number of individuals starting the stage N e = number of individuals ending the stage for example, 83.0 individuals (per m 2 ) entered the pupal stage in 1955 &#151; 54.6 were killed by pupal predators (shrews, mice and beetles) during late summer, leaving only 28.4 per m 2 : k 5 = log(83.0) - log(28.4) = 0.47 we can then plot overall mortality along with all of the &quot;component&quot; mortalities, and look for those that are most responsible for the observed pattern &#151; i.e., look for the key factors in this case, winter disappearance is the key factor causing the major fluctuations in population size we can also plot the k values for different years against the population density at each time to look for density-dependence in the various mortalities: here winter disappearance is density-independent, but pupal predation (increases with density) and mortality due to other parasites (decreases with density) are both density-dependent D. Experimental Manipulations besides key factor analysis, another method of determining which factor(s) determine or limit population size is to experimentally manipulate suspected factors and observe the effects on \npopulation size: e.g., you can experimentally reduce or increase the numbers of predators, competitors, parasites, food organisms, etc. provides stronger evidence than simple correlations between environmental factors and population size in unmanipulated populations some factors are hard to regulate (e.g., weather), but you can still make predictions about the outcome of a cold spring on deer population size, for example Last Updated: Wednesday, November 18, 2000 Contact: Dr. David J.
