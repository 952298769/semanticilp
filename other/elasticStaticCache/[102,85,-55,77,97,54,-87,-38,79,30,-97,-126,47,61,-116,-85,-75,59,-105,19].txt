after the learning process for \nassessing outcomes Tests Direct Measures of Student Learning Commercial, norm-referenced, standardized exams summative assessment Examples ETS Academic Profile ACT Collegiate Assessment of Academic Proficiency College Basic Academic Subjects Examination ETS Tasks in Critical Thinking ETS Major Field Test Advantages Quickly adopted and implemented Objectively scored External validity Reference group comparison Disadvantages Results not useful for student or program evaluation Results susceptible to misinterpretation Reducing disadvantages Campus measurement experts review reliability and validity data and summarize pros/cons Faculty review all available instruments and choose test that best fits curriculum Choose tests that also provide criterion-referenced results Use multiple assessment methods Locally-developed exams summative assessment Examples Measure students course-specific knowledge Advantages Content and style customized for goals and objectives of institution, program, or curriculum Local grading by faculty for immediate feedback Results useful for student and program evaluation Disadvantages Costly in time and

page Competency-Based Measures Direct Measures of Student Learning Performance Appraisals formative assessment of demonstration of acquired skills Examples Appraisals of students at work to measure job-related behaviors such as leadership and communications Advantages Go beyond paper/pencil tests and most other assessment techniques and instruments Are preferable for measuring generalization of learning to specific settings and situations Relevant to professional training programs with well-defined skill development Usually the most valid measure of skill development Disadvantages Ratings and grading more subjective than for standardized tests Costly for time required Sample of performance appraised may not be typical because of observers presence Reducing disadvantages Develop specific measurable criteria for appraising performance Provide training for appraisers Conduct appraisals in least obtrusive manner Cross validate results with other measures Consider using students and community volunteers as appraisers to reduce cost and faculty time Simulation formative assessment when performance appraisal not possible Examples Role-playing problem solving situations to approximate the results of performance appraisal Advantages Better means of evaluating student skill development than tests Flexible-some degree of simulation can be arranged for virtually any student skill Can be group-administered for many skills Excellent measure for increasing external and internal validity of skills assessment at minimal long-term costs Disadvantages Costly (like performance appraisals) for difficult skills Usually requires considerable planning and preparation More expensive than traditional testing options in the short run Reducing disadvantages Can often be

assessment or institution Inexperienced observers can produce unreliable, invalid results Reducing disadvantages Avoid socially or ethically sensitive behaviors initially Use electronic observers whenever possible for accurate, reliable permanent observation record Classroom research formative assessment techniques used by teachers Examples Any classroom techniques for getting student feedback and improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning Advantages Provides direct feedback to teachers enabling continuous improvement Is a multimethod approach to assessment Conveys interest in student learning Disadvantages Results based on small sample sizes difficult to generalize results Standardization and validation difficult Simple techniques could be misused by untrained faculty Reducing disadvantages Provide training and support to faculty Encourage development of techniques across classes for general education assessment Portfolios summative assessment student work samples Examples Collections of multiple student academic work samples compiled over time Advantages Can be used to view learning and development longitudinally, which is highly valid and useful Can measure multiple components of a curriculum at same time Avoids test anxiety Increases student participation in assessment process Disadvantages Costly for evaluator time and effort Establishing reliable and valid grading criteria is challenging May not provide for external validity Students will select their best work Reducing disadvantages Submit at end of capstone course Collect portfolios from a
