Extended Lecture Outline Chapter 52 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline STRATEGIES OF VERTEBRATE SEX AND REPRODUCTION Sex Evolved in the Sea Female marine fish produce eggs, or ova (ovum) release into water Males release sperm, or spermatozoa into water containing eggs Union called external fertilization Problems of external fertilization in water Dilution of gametes in expanse of sea water Release of gametes must be nearly simultaneous Reproduction restricted to seasonal periods Problems of external fertilization on land Greater danger of desiccation of gametes Intense selective pressure to develop internal fertilization Three strategies for embryonic and fetal development in internal fertilization Oviparity Examples: some bony fish, most reptiles, all birds Eggs laid outside mother`s body to complete development Ovoviviparity Examples: some bony fishes, including mollies, guppies, mosquito fish Eggs retained within mother to complete development Embryos obtain nourishment from egg yolk Fully developed young hatch from eggs and are released Viviparity fig 52.1 Examples: most cartilaginous fishes, almost all mammals Embryonic and fetal young develop within mother Obtain nutrition from mother, not just from egg yolk Fishes Most fertilization is external Egg contains enough yolk to support embryo for short time Development speedy, young mature rapidly Eggs laid in great quantities, few grow to maturity Fertilization internal in most cartilaginous fishes, development viviparous Amphibians Reproduction tied to the presence of water, fertilization external Gametes from both sexes released through cloaca Male grasps female and discharges sperm as eggs are laid fig 52.2 Most eggs develop in water Development takes longer than fishes, not greater amount of yolk Development divided into three stages Embryo develops in egg, yolk provides nutrition Aquatic larva hatches from egg, functions as feeding individual Undergoes metamorphosis into terrestrial adult form Reptiles and Birds Reptiles Eggs fertilized internally before eggs are laid fig 52.3 Male penis injects sperm into female reproductive tract Most are oviparous, lay eggs and abandon them Eggs are surrounded by leathery shell Shell deposited as egg passes through fallopian tube, or oviduct Others are ovoviviparous or viviparous Birds All exhibit internal fertilization Most male birds lack penis All are oviparous Egg passes through fallopian tube Glands secrete albumin proteins, hard calcareous shell Incubate eggs with homeothermic bodies Young born relatively underdeveloped, require parental care Both classes exhibit amniotic eggs Embryo develops within fluid-filled cavity surrounded by amnion Amnion is an extraembryonic membrane Chorion lies inside egg shell, also extraembryonic as is yolk sac Mammals Some reproduce once per year, others have shorter cycles In latter, females usually undergo reproductive cycles Males more constant in reproductive activity Female cycling process Ovulation: periodic release of mature ovum from ovary Most females receptive to males only around ovulation Period of receptivity called estrus, cycle called estrus cycle Cycling continues till pregnancy occurs Estrous cycles involves changes in hormonal levels Changes in secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by anterior pituitary Cause changes in egg cell development, ovary hormone secretion Burst of LH secretion triggers ovulation Humans and apes exhibit menstrual cycles Similar to estrus cycles in cyclic pattern of hormone secretion and ovulation Individuals may engage in sexual intercourse at any time during cycle Rabbits and cats are induced ovulators Ovulation not typically cyclic Sexual intercourse causes reflexive release of LH, triggers ovulation Monotremes are oviparous Incubate eggs in nest Hatchlings obtain milk from glands on mother's skin (lack nipples) All other mammals are viviparous Marsupials born at early stage, complete development in pouches Placental mammals retained within mother's uterus Nourished internally by mother via the placenta Placenta derived from chorion and mother's uterine lining Nutrients derived via diffusion from mother's blood Young are born more completely developed THE MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM Sex Determination Male and female reproductive systems appear similar for first forty days Cells that give rise to gametes migrate from yolk sac to embryonic gonads Gonads have potential to become ovaries or testes (testis, singular) Embryonic gonads are thus indifferent fig 52.4 In males, Y chromosome has gene whose product will convert gonads into testes In females, lack Y and its proteins, gonads become ovaries Sex determining gene may by SRY gene Structure and Function of the Male Reproductive System 43-50 days after conception testes develop seminiferous tubules, site of sperm production Leydig cells between tubules secrete testosterone at 9-10 weeks Testosterone converts indifferent structures into male external genitalia Includes penis and scrotal sac that contains testes fig 52.5 Without testosterone structures develop into female external genitalia Testosterone also promotes production of sperm Hormone production declines until onset of puberty Resurgence renews sperm production Also causes development of male secondary sexual characteristics Includes growth of facial hair, lowering of voice, larger muscle mass Supports development of accessory sex organs Assist in maturation and transport of gametes Testis composed of tightly coiled seminiferous tubules fig 52.6 Testes initially formed within \nabdominal cavity Descend through inguinal canal into the scrotum Temperature maintained slightly lower than core body temperature Lower temperature required for normal mammalian sperm development Production of sperm Haploid sperm have 23 chromosomes each Produced by division of diploid parent cell Parent cell undergoes mitosis, one cell forms sperm, other remains as parent cell Male never runs out of sperm-producing parent cells Diploid daughter cell called primary spermatocytes, begins meiosis Produces two diploid secondary spermatocytes after first division Each produces two haploid spermatids after second meiotic division Each primary spermatocyte produces four haploid spermatids All of these cells constitute germinal epithelium of seminiferous tubules Walls of seminiferous tubules also contain Sertoli cells Nurse developing sperm, secrete products needed for spermatogenesis Help convert spermatids into spermatozoa by engulfing cytoplasm fig 52.7 Spermatozoa composed of head, body and tail fig 52.8 Head encloses nucleus, capped by acrosome that aids penetration into egg Body and tail provide propulsion Tail

causes Sertoli cells to release inhibin peptide hormone, inhibits FSH LH stimulates testosterone, which feeds back to inhibit LH Structure and Function of the Female Reproductive System Ovaries develop more slowly, ovarian follicles appear about day 105 Follicle is hollow, contains developing ovum and granulosa cells Female ovary at birth contains 2 million ova which have initiated meiosis Meiosis arrested at first meiotic division, forms primary oocytes In absence of testosterone Embryo develops clitoris and labia majoris Homologous to penis and scrotum in males At puberty, granulosa cells secrete estradiol (estrogen) Triggers menarche, onset of menstrual cycling Stimulates formation of female secondary sexual characteristics Causes breast development, production of pubic hair Estradiol and progesterone maintain female accessory organs Include fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina fig 52.12 Female accessory organs Fallopian tubes transport ovum from ovaries to uterus Uterus narrows to form cervix, opening to vagina fig 52.13 Lined with stratified epithelial membrane, the endometrium Outer layer is shed during menstruation Inner layer generates new surface at next cycle More complex female tracts in non-primate mammals Uterus divides to form uterine horns, each leads to fallopian tube fig 52.13b,c Some marsupials have unconnected horns, two cervixes, two vaginas Menstrual and estrus cycles Human menstrual cycle lasts 28 days on average Few follicles stimulated to grow in each cycle, only one achieves maturity Fully mature follicle called Graafian follicle fig 52.14 Forms blister on surface of ovary Phase of cycle called follicular phase Granulosa cells in Graafian follicle secrete increasing amounts of estradiol Stimulates growth of endometrium Also called proliferative phase of endometrium Primary oocyte in Graafian follicle completes first meiotic division Produces one large secondary oocyte, one polar body fig 52.15 Secondary oocyte acquires nearly all of cytoplasm Begins second meiotic division, arrested at metaphase II Increased estradiol stimulates anterior pituitary to secrete LH Graafian follicle bursts, releasing secondary oocyte Oocyte released near fimbria, opening to fallopian tube Ciliated epithelial cells line tube, propel oocyte toward uterus Disintegrates within one day if not fertilized Stimulus of fertilization triggers completion of second meiotic division Forms mature ovum and second polar body Fusion of sperm and ovum nuclei produces diploid zygote fig 52.15 Fertilization normally occurs in upper third of fallopian tube Takes three days to reach uterus, 2-3 days to implant fig 52.16 With LH, empty Graafian follicle develops into corpus luteum Second half of phase called luteal phase Corpus luteum secretes estradiol and progesterone Causes buildup of endometrium Called secretory phase of the endometrium High levels of estradiol and progesterone exert negative feedback Inhibit FSH and LH secretion by anterior pituitary Acts as natural contraceptive mechanism Prevents development of new follicles and further ovulations Effect duplicated by birth control pills Without fertilization, corpus luteum triggers own atrophy Secretes hormones to shut of LH production Atrophy may be assisted by luteolysin, secreted by fallopian tubes Abrupt decline in estradiol and progesterone causes sloughing of endometrium Process called menstruation, called menstrual phase of endometrium Summary of events fig 52.17 With fertilization regression of corpus luteum averted by chorionic gonadotropin LH-like hormone produced by developing embryo Maintains high levels of estradiol and progesterone, prevents menstruation Pregnancy tests assay levels of chorionic gonadotropin Animals without estrus cycle do not menstruate Shed cells from endometrium, no accompanying bleeding Estrous cycle phases: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, diestrus Correspond to proliferative, mid-cycle, secretory and menstrual phases THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HUMAN SEXUAL INTERCOURSE Excitement Initiated by nervous system Increases respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, dilates blood vessels Nipples harden and become more sensitive Genital vasocongestion Causes erection of male \npenis Causes swelling of female clitoris and labia majora and labia minora Vagina walls become moist, muscles relax Plateau Penetration of penis into vagina stimulates nerve endings Intensifies sympathetic nervous system response Female begins pelvic thrusts Penis reaches greatest length Orgasm Stimulation initiates a series of reflexive muscular contractions Female response Contractions initiated by hypothalamus, causes release of oxytocin Causes contractions of uterus and cervix Peaks may be singular and intense or multiple and less intense Male response Nerve signals from brain cause emission Cause contractions of vas deferens and prostate gland Sperm and seminal fluid move through urethra Violent contractions of muscles at base of penis cause ejaculation Orgasmic contraction is singular and intense Resolution Male erection lost rapidly after ejaculation Refractory period lasts twenty minutes or longer Further arousal difficult Female arousal can be reinitiated immediately BIRTH CONTROL Human Intercourse Not Solely Associated with Reproduction Continual sexual receptivity is problematic Pregnancy avoided by birth control or contraception fig 52.18 Effectiveness of methods varies tbl 52.2 Abstinence Complete lack of sex is simplest and most reliable method Rhythm method attempts to determine safe period Involves abstinence two days before to one or two days after ovulation Ovulation difficult to predict Effectiveness of method is low In coitus interruptus the male withdraws from the female Prematurely released sperm can be secreted Effectiveness is low Sperm Blockage Condom over the penis prevents transfer of sperm to vagina Decreases sensory pleasure in the male Failure rate is better, but not completely effective Additionally protects against AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases Cervix can be covered Accomplished by cervical cap or diaphragm Must be fitted by a physician Effectiveness varies Sperm Destruction Douching is very ineffective Spermicidal jellies, foams or sponges vary in effectiveness Prevention of Ovulation Daily ingestion of hormones in a birth control pill Contain estrogen and progesterone Shut down production of pituitary LH and FSH Body acts as though ovulation has just occurred Low failure rate Implant capsules of hormones have a lower failure rate Short-term side effects may occur Long-term effects unknown, outweighs risk of pregnancy Sterilization fig 52.19 Results in removal of a portion of the reproductive tract Vasectomy: a portion of each vas deferens is removed Tubal ligation: a portion of each fallopian tube is removed Hysterectomy: complete removal of uterus Failure rate approaches zero Method is irreversible, individual is permanently sterile Prevention of Embryo Implantation Insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) into the uterus Irritation prevents implantation Low failure rate, considerable side effects Morning after pill contains large amounts of estrogen Abortion Removal of the fetus from the uterus Can be accomplished during the first trimester Use vacuum suction or cervical dilation and curettage (scraping of the uterus) RU 486 is a newly developed abortive drug used in first trimester Approved for use in some countries, not U.S. Administer drug, follow with prostaglandins to induce uterine contractions Injection of strong saline induces early labor Can be done through the second trimester More advanced pregnancy increases danger to the mother AN OVERVIEW OF VERTEBRATE
