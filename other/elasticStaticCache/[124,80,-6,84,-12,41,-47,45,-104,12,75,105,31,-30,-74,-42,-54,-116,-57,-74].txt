wasp larvae can e.g. supercool to -47C, adult Himalayan midges are frost tolerant and even maintain activity to -16C - eggs and pupae can be very resistant to or tolerant of drying Mollusc e.g. gastropods (snails) adults, eggs adult snails hibernate in soil or under leaves, some can survive freezing in ice Lichen dry normal form associations of fungi and algae or blue green algae (bacteria) - can survive freezing very well if dry - radiation resistant Bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) e.g. mosses normal form and spores normal form can survive freezing, usually better so if dry, but some happy when wet - spores also are fairly resistant Pteridophyte e.g. ferns spores in some forms can resist drought and cold Gymnosperm e.g. conifers seeds in cones adult plants can be very frost and drought resistant, although sensitive to radiation - seeds can be similarly resistant, and also have fire survival mechanisms Angiosperm (flowering plants) seeds adult plants can be very long lived, and may have storage organs and/or survival strategies for winters or droughts or fires - seeds of temperate plants can be very frost and or drought resistant - tropical forms much less so, although desert plant seeds can, again, be particularly long lived - desert plant seeds can survive for many decades, arctic plant seeds have been reported as surviving frozen for hundreds (maybe thousands*) of years - angiosperms include the major food species for humans - *recent work has suggested that hundreds of years is more likely than thousands Vertebrate Fish e.g. Cynolebias (a tooth carp genus) hard shelled eggs these and a few other fish survive seasonal loss of water by burying eggs in mud, to hatch when water returns - adult lungfish (e.g. Lepidosiren ) do this to themselves, in cocoons to avoid overdrying Amphibia e.g. frogs adult forms some, e.g. wood frogs, can survive being completely frozen - others hibernate deep in the ground or survive drought buried in dried mud Reptiles adults many temperate types (e.g. turtles, snakes) hibernate in holes in the ground Mammals adults some can hibernate, involving lowering of temperature and/or other physiological changes such as urea recycling -
