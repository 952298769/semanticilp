(PARODY OF DON MCLEAN'S \"AMERICAN PIE\") \"AMERICAN CHEESE\" (PARODY OF DON MCLEAN'S \"AMERICAN PIE\") AMERICAN CHEESE - Ryan Wainio A few short hours ago I went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, just to make a sandwich And I knew if I just had some Spam I wouldn't have to use cheese and ham And maybe I'd be happy for a while But something I saw made me quiver I caught the odor of rotten liver Bad food on the first rack The broccoli was turning black I can't remember if I cried When I saw the cheese was old and dried But something made me really sad The day the food went bad So Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze Even the mayonnaise was stinkin' like somethin' died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die Well, do you like to eat olives And if you do, do you want \nsome, I've had enough Even though they're a few years old Do you put cheese on a dinner roll Can the Packers win the Super Bowl And can you reach me from my trance, I don't know Well our janitor is really dim Cause he sees us eating in the gym Oh, he says he doesn't know Why we don't eat on the tables I got bologna stuck between my teeth When I ate it this morning in my pickup truck And I know that I wasn't glad The day the food went bad I started singing Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze The corn-on-the cob was stinking like something died And everything is moldy and dry This might be the day that I die Now for 10 days I was gone from home Now there's mold that looks like it was purposely grown But that's not how it came to be My neighbor Chester came for some jelly beans But instead he got a bowl of ice cream I had rice that came from Milwaukee Oh, and while my back was turned away Chester ran off with my ice tray I caught him just before He could get out of the door And my two lemons made some rude remarks They weren't yellow, but really dark And there's a feeling that I had The day my food went bad It was stinking Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even tangerines were stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die I used to like to eat bread and butter The bird flew off to see his brother Eight pieces of pie, rotting fast And the ham is foul, so I think I'll pass Cake with three layers, it's time has passed And then Chester ate some cheese and he got gas And my appetite even still resumed But, I don't think I'll be eating anything soon Now I have stomach cramps Ooh, but I'd rather eat a postage stamp Then my fingers touched a banana peel Now I can't have a decent meal I had to go through an ordeal The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock at thirty-seven degrees Even sauerkraut was stinkin' like something died Think of all the food I'll have to buy It almost makes a guy wanna' cry Well the fridge had stunk up the whole place The refrigeration was a big disgrace With no food left to eat at all So, come on it's a symbol of my life My hungers cutting me up like a knife And I picked up a carrot, it wouldn't bend Oh and as I stood there by the fridge The cheese fell off of the second ridge There's no mouse in hell That would eat that cheese that fell And as the time climbed here into the night You'd say the day just wasn't right I couldn't satisfy my appetite The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even the applesauce was stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry And this could be the day when I die I went door to door and got on my knees And I begged them for some ham and cheese But they just laughed and they turned away I went down to the grocery store Where I'd bought the cheese from weeks before But the bird there said the cheese was out of stock He showed me meats and corn that's canned Some of them creamed, and some generic brand But now my heart was breaking All the cheese was taken So the three kinds that I eat the most American, Swiss, and Colby Jack They were on a freight train on the tracks The day the food went bad I started thinking From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy Everything in my fridge is stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die And now I'm thinkin' From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy Everythin' in my fridge was stinking like somethin'died And now everything is moldy and dry MY MAIN PAGE",0.6066280007362366],["X1011574961-00163-40948</DOCNO> Vocabulary List-Nebraska (3) Core Vocabulary: Older Adults (Across

calculate the calories and categories Counting up the carrots as the world goes by Everyone remembers all the really fat and ugly women Dancing with each other in the high school gym And everybody's read about the fat guy in the Guiness book And wondered what the hell was really wrong with him Look at all the chubby cheekers Checking out the chocolates While the people with the money do the fat boy dance Totally dumbfounded well endowed and so well rounded Crying out how they're the victims of a circumstance All the wealthy women who have recently discovered They could satisfy a lover with diminished girth Try to keep the secret but then ultimately leak it When they speak about the heaven that is here on earth There's a whole new breed of surgeon Fully armed with suction guns Hired by some health food virgin Tired of the fat farm fun No one's had the nerve to weigh her No one's seen a curve for years She can pay to see her layers disappear See the dietician losing by the hour While the people with the power take away her job See her mutter at her California cutter While he builds a perfect woman from a perfect slob Why should someone worry about eating in a hurry When the caramel and the curry can be cut away Why not stuff your faces If you know that there are places That can just surgically erase your every milky way See the rich girl fire her trainer See her tuck away her thigh See them make a vain girl vainer As they suck her body dry See her smile for the camera Hear her thank her lucky star They would kill to watch her fill the jelly jar See the upper crusters drawn and quartered See the plastic people rioting It's not exactly what the doctor ordered But so much easier than dieting Stick a needle in the fatty tissue Stick a needle in the derriere No one else could take a social issue Turn it into such a fashion fair See the kid who's been so totally insipid He's been saving up the lipids for a rainy day Thinks it kind of funny that some hypodermic honey For a little bit a money drains the past away Everyone who's phobic about being anaerobic Can endure the mock heroics of the surgeons' grind Every tofu hater can revert to steak and taters If he knows that sometime later he'll be redesigned See the girl who swallowed fingers Showing off her appetite Knowing there's some nut to cut out every bite Pinch a fistful and you've wrung the curtain Pinch a fistful and your lover's gone Why be wistful when you know for certain There's a blissful way to carry on Stick a needle and it's hello sailor Stick a needle and it's hello friend Send some business to your human tailor Spend the means to buy your perfect end Slip the tube Into the sack of suet As you pass the fluid with some tenderness Greet the future With a single suture As you roto-root your way to slenderness Stick a needle and you quit the fat boom Stick a needle and you quit the gym Join the people with the human vacuum They will keep you looking fit and trim Stick a

would lose my self restraint If I walk another mile That would surely make me faint There are people out there screaming Tugging on a sleeve all afternoon Why is everybody screaming Can't they think of something else to do We were out there on the freeway And we thought that we'd try something new Give the kids a little leeway Thinking that they might enjoy the view Why are children always nauseous Why do siblings always start a fight Nothing worse than being nauseous Could it be another form of spit We took all our savings And we'll take lots of slides We followed our cravings As we swallowed our pride We're taking the kids Taking the kids Taking the kids to Disney World We'd been on the road for hours Thinking that we'd love to turn around 'Cause the weather looks like showers What time to be Orlando bound And the kids were getting restless Which, of course, had put us in a funk Why are children always restless Maybe we could put them in the trunk We stocked up on patience

never could trust But Mickey Mouse isn't so meek He's on the front page of the weeklies Hanging around with some sheik He's less than a man but He's more than cartoon He handles the folks so uniquely No one gets more than a peek See everything's clean and squeaky At the riki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki room We were terrorized this morning Riding It's A Small World After All And there should have been a warning Parents must have lots of alcohol There's a woman in a rat suit Tell me does she ever get a breath Always stuck inside a rat suit Scaring all the children half to death We battled the tollway While they straddled our laps We scolded the whole way As we folded our maps We're taking the kids We're taking the kids We're taking the kids to Disney World As the sun was slowly sinkin' We were clearly ready for the end Still we liked the talkin' Lincoln But not enough to ever go again Everybody bought the mouse ears Even though we tried to play it smart Nothing cuter than the mouse

how to fight Then when he was ten years old his parents got divorced Father was so cold and mother was so forced It hurts so bad inside, he thought it was all his fault He discovered it was a lie, all the things he once was taught Tomorrow's child he cries But only in his mind He gets so cold inside He leaves his ones behind Today he's a full grown man Wife & children and a piece of land He's got a steady job, no trouble in the way Suddenly there she stands, again in love he takes her by the hand He tries to tell his wife, he wants this woman to stay in his life Tomorrow's child he cries But only in his mind He gets so cold inside He leaves his ones behind This is not the curse of God, nor of the accuser It's the curse of mankind that makes him an ordinary loser The older says: you can go to hell The younger says: she's crazy He loves them both, they know this well Pride hold them back, they lose him Women of this world today Don't wow this world away A man is fertile all his life,

needing to get up on several occasions feeling dazed each time I got the bus to work at about 6am at the bus stop there was a very nice young woman I tried saying good morning yet couldn't get this out of my mouth I didn't feel nervous or anything like that I just felt I was being controlled [this happened again and again today] as the bus reached Burleigh Heads the bus didn't stop the driver saying this isn't a mandatory stop every other time I have travelled to work it has been I was told on one occasion that I never had to indicate the driver as this was a mandatory stop I got off wondering what was going on here, the bus was then on its way to Tweed Heads with the driver mentioning this many times during the trip, the taxi driver was one who I hadn't had for some time he was a

another one of the cabinetmakers came to me very arrogantly after some board cut when I told him that there wasn't any board of that type he wanted he told me \"you better find some then\" I got a

Holiday as I got to work Dave C was there yet there was no sign of Simon Dave didn't have the keys to get in and we waited outside until 7.35am when Simon arrived on picking up my very wet bag which wasn't very heavy I noticed that the muscles in my left shoulder and back was very sore feeling like I had strained them yet I hadn't done any thing for this to happen, walking into the factory I noticed that Dace P had cut a job yesterday as well as changed the settings on the saw by my tape measure it was cutting 2 millimetres under size and was out of alignment I tried cutting some board with very bad results the board end being 3 millimetres narrower on one end, I thought how am I going to cut anything with the saw like this I couldn't believe it, this aggravated me as I know Dave can do better then this, I changed a few things then kept working yet all morning I wasn't very happy at all [interfered with for curtain] Dave C came up to the saw a few times where I was working with his head down looking he had a guilty conscientious at 11am Simon came up to me saying that's enough for today having a little talk to me about getting the kitchens out faster saying the

happen or after something has been done, at about 6pm I tried having a sleep yet couldn't get into any sort of sleep after the work I had done today, I was also very impotent with my penis muscles feeling contracted there was no sperm whatsoever, all my muscles were stiff and sore and again I was thinking over and over about my car \"so you think its going to \nstart it will never see the road

Start-Up's fail\" Information for this presentation came from interviews with several VC's Neither last year nor this year \"normal\" Last Year = EXCESS This Year = Valley following Excess Today's funding environment is \"beyond brutal\" Success = business succeeds at its mission - becomes a \"long term viable business\" NOT necessarily = IPO NOT necessarily = acquisition/buyout Concerning acquisitions... Preferred Stock gets $$ back Common Stock often gets ZERO back because... most acquisitions are done under duress Preferred's are guaranteed multiples, which can drain all $$$ away from Common A VC told Presenter that they \"never invest in anything started by/run by a lawyer\" if things go wrong, lawyers get litigious lawyers are pessimists... entrepreneurs must be optimists Angel funding BAD family & friends - if they are your angels - hate you when company fails therefore... confirm an idea is good enough to get real money before getting family/friend money determine if this idea is a HOBBY or a BUSINESS Hobby = you pay for it yourself Business = you get somebody else to pay for it \"Dilution is your friend\" as long as you are being diluted by good money as long as your company

wave to support the trial/error process Most attempts to \"shoot over the horizon\" fail occurs when you try to guess about a market that will exist in the future very hard to determine for sure if environmental variables will actually create that market even if the market does materialize, very hard to time it properly Passion for the Idea Must have \"work until drop dead\" motivation Financing Fundamentals \"The money picture is paramount\" You WILL STALL if \"every round is not about the next round\" Currently, VC's are just chopping off their bottom 50% of companies in their portfolios whether they are meeting targets or not The stigma of not doing follow-on funding for companies you funded before is gone VC's are currently sitting on \"buckets of money\" That is, VC's have commitments from their partners, but are not making \"capital calls\" for now MUCH MORE $$$ in VC coffers this year than last year MUST CONCENTRATE ON FUNDAMENTALS How many people will buy it How much

Descendents Of The Shoah And The Third Reich His Blind Date A Traditional Family Not Worth Mentioning Words Defective Genes The Master Race His Blind Date when his brother's girlfriend asks him to be the blind date for a pretty German girl visiting her aunt in Antwerp the words he hears are pretty and girl - at age twenty his thoughts of girls and how to meet them consume many of his waking hours only later after he has accepted this blind date his first does the girl's nationality cause him alarm anxiety intrudes into his eager expectations grows stronger as the afternoon comes to a close by early evening he is almost ready to call it off -- all afternoon he has remembered what his father has written into the family's Bible -- in memory of my dear father killed by the Germans in memory of my dear mother killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Elijahu his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Tsilia her husband and three children killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Chaim his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Hannah and her husband killed by the Germans in memory of my cousins aunts and uncles killed by the Germans his mother's family had suffered a similar fate the only survivor of the nearly hundred relatives was his father's youngest sister her husband and two sons who had survived by hiding in a cramped place too low to stand upright liberated by the Russians so weak and stooped none of them could stand up straight memories he hadn't thought about for years flood him - his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork

Backing Vocals Michael Mattioli: Alto & Tenor Sax Ralph Rickert: Trumpet Dave Woodley: Trombone Recorded and mixed at Loyola Marymount University in 1991 DO IT FOR LOVE (Slavens, Muller, Brand, Emert) baby you can rob a bank or hold up a 7-11 you can shoplift merchandise and still buy your way into heaven all you need is a valid excuse they'll tell you it's a sin to steal but you're only as guilty as you feel just don't do what the bad people do you can get away with anything if you do it for love you can get away with anything if you do it but just make sure you're doing it you can get away with anything if you do it for love absolution comes from within but love alone can save your soul from sin just don't do what the bad people do do it for love and only for love not for money or for power or some God up above no judge or jury ever can convict you, son I WAS CONFUSED (ABOUT THE TELEVISION SET) (Slavens, Muller, Brand) I watched the news just the other day and there's just one thing that I must say it gave me a pain right in the middle of my head the newsman came on with his face and told me about the big disgrace let me know just how many people got dead and I got down, it brought me down so I got up and turned it off that left me alone with my thoughts and a great big pain right in the middle of my head and I was confused I didn't know what to do I watched a show just the other night and I must say something was not right how come people on television's weird in the head well they won't show sex but they show a lot of killing guess it must be better to show blood spilling than to let little junior see two naked people in bed EAST COAST JONES (Slavens) back home it's the same things are very slow to change by the time the news comes in from L.A. the latest fad is already passe (hey, hey) the clothes and the music and the latest phrase tomorrow has the reek of yesterday everybody wants to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play back here it's the same everything is up to date they say build it up, buy it up, eat it up fast it's made for looks but it ain't made to last buy a nice house buy a nice car junior executives born to be a star if you want \nto be in fashion you'll have to pay the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play out there it's the same except there ain't nobody knows your name 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'you can run but you can never hide' well you see all the same rules will still apply you'll still get low you know you'll still get high everybody runs to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play CRAWL (Slavens) crawl into another head stand up take a look around - tell me what you see crawl into another head now, when I was a baby I just couldn't understand why everybody didn't think like I did and it messed with my head it took me years to overcome it but I finally did when I took a little trip in someone else's head now, everybody tells me that I gotta have a world view well I listen very carefully but I don't always know what to do there's a lot of bogus causes phony ideologies but if you pick yourself the right one you can set your spirit free now, I am on the right side maybe you are on the left side and we're looking at the same thing but we're looking at it differently I guess I'm talking about perspective but it's different from that if you can walk around with someone else's brain under your hat it's a very simple reason and a lot of people learn it but a lot of people close their minds to certain information they are trying to avoid any unwanted stimulation that might make them reevaluate the values that they live by CASTLE ON THE HILL (Slavens) gotta wonder how you sleep at night with the front door locked and the windows drawn up tight in your castle up on the hill baby, baby, do you know what I mean there's a great big world that I know you've never seen from your castle up on the hill You built it brick by brick and locked yourself inside you're sitting safe in a great big fortress but I don't know what you're hiding from I guess you're worried that you might find out that you've been missing what your life is all about while you're sitting in your castle on the hill if you ask me you're just a victim of your own devices money and security will not suffice go out and get a real life break out of the castle on the hill THE BUFFALO CLUB (Slavens) I don't belong to the Buffalo Club but I sure would like to wake up in the morning and find out it's all been a terrible dream does anybody see it as a warning have you been out there on the street pretty lights above your head pretty bricks beneath your feet clean off the spray paint on the walls clean the kids and clean their minds until there's nothing left to clean except the sky have you been checking out the changes I hear so many names I see so many different faces all the suffering from the same disease did you find out young that life is short and try to take the easy way out there's no easy way out how I wish that I could be naive I long to be taken in tricked into believing again OLD EYES (Slavens) I met you in an earlier time we had just one thing in common that was the only thing in my life I remember that one spring day when we drove out in the country flying past houses, farms and fields I would give anything to be with you again I would give anything to hear you call my name I would give anything to see your smiling face to see you with my old eyes that wasn't so long ago when we were both quite naive oh the things that I believed I remember the summer with you when we lived out in the country so much life and so much time time is changing now my life is rearranged there's so much trouble we got lost I could not find you had to leave you far behind but I will be with you again ALLIGATOR BRAIN (Slavens, Muller) taste of blood on my lips cold spot in my heart man of action plan of action no reaction cold spot in my heart there's a cold spot in my heart if I love you I can hurt you cold spot in my heart everything that you say can be used in a cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart the knife cuts my heart bleeds please don't push me baby, there's a cold spot in my heart just can't be responsible for tearing you apart when I'm in my alligator brain I see my chance I make my move got a cold spot I've got a cold spot in my heart once I'm in motion there is no devotion just one cold emotion cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart LOVE IS THE QUESTION (Slavens) love is the question that my heart's been asking and you are the answer every night I go to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep if I have to climb a thousand mountains high I will be there for you, baby I will show you how to fly yeah, yeah, yeah won't you do it once for me cover me with kisses, baby YEAH RIGHT (Slavens, Muller) everybody's driving in their cars everybody's telling me \nboy you've gotta be a big star I don't listen to what they say I just concentrate on having a nice day and I say hey, hey, hey get outta my face changes coming 'round soon enough gonna put you all in your place so get yourself a job that pays real good find yourself a house in a nice neighborhood get some money in the bank and nothing bad will happen don't worry about the nightly news somebody else has got the blues you're on top and you can't lose nothing bad will happen ...yeah, right as it was it is and shall be evermore don't be too concerned about what the future has in store cuz you don't want to change it anyway well, this is how you dig it so this is how it stays and I say whoa, whoa, whoa maintain the status quo and don't tell me about changes, baby I don't want to know CAST OUT YOUR DEMONS (Slavens) everybody's talking talking all about you don't pretend that you don't know seems you got a problem you don't have to be too smart to guess it right on the nose something's got the better of you and it's sticking to your life like gum on your shoe Everybody's worried worried all about you wondering when you're gonna explode don't be too surprised if they all stand back and leave you alone to carry the load something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you you better cast out your demons everybody loves you everybody still cares about you even when you push them away but hey we're all human and you'll push it to the limit you'll wake up alone some day something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you I know it's gonna be hard but you better cast out your demons BYE-BYE (Slavens) I had a dream a particular scene though now it gets hard to remember you looked so real as you sat at the wheel the air smelled of early December I heard the sound of your voice remember Luanne I heard the sound of your voice say to me... bye-bye hope you remember my name when I'm gone bye-bye don't really know if it meant anything but I feel like a better man today it sounded so true that I knew it was you though I can't recall what you were saying if I was there you didn't seem to care when you spoke you were looking right through me I left school and I guess things got cool between you and our person in common but he was there too he went through it with you who's to say which one came out better UNDERWATER (Slavens, Muller, Brand, Emert) air all around but no water to be found I dance around but the surroundings don't suit me I'm looking for a familiar face I'm reaching for something but I don't know I'm on the outside now I'd love to get back in again I never should have jumped just lack of self discipline and I long to be back underwater once I was so safe and sound just floating all around and there was nothing much to do or see but I long to be back underwater All lyrics by Paul Slavens Musical Arrangements by Ten Hands Please click here to return to the Ten Hands

would be able to stand Camp life when he left home my reason for thinking so is the way he left his business he wanted me to take charge of his business and I told him that if I did so I wanted some person to make a return of the same to and he made choice of Riley and left an instrument of writing the power of an attorney with him and with me to Tan Finish and make sale of all his stock of

Taned Finished and sold the leather and we Riley John Layton Wm Brown and myself all saw the papers that Riley and me held and thought best to go according and write to you and Franklin and hear from you both we all was willing and thought best to go according to the directions he left and we also was in favor of settling his business without any administration as we are all of age and have the right and save unnecessary expences also we think best to not sell his land and some other property untill times become more settled for we do not believe it would bring much now the way times are and

Live forever or turn to dust Whatever happens it's what we've done And now that we have reached The time to choose our destiny Global unity I do preach Love the saviour of humanity The Rivets Are Popping 500 plus species per day Are leaving the web of life Man's extinction is on the way Cutting our own throats with a knife Like Paul Ehrlich says The rivets are popping We're like a plane in the

around I try to find hope But I'm disappointed every time I'm at the end of my rope Waiting for humanity to pay for its crime I try to find hope But it is irreversibly too late I was once filled with hope But now I know that which is to be our fate The Weight Of The World I want to see the majesty I want to sense the wonder I want to advert the tragedy I want to stop the blunder The weight of the world The time running out The hate constantly unfurled The crime of silence all about The Pervasive Charade Keep it up Prop it up Never let it fall The pervasive charade Is now spoken By all A Dead Canary In A Coal Mine Like the lemmings Marching to the sea I see all of humanity Racing to the end A dead canary In a coal mine that's me Warning us now The Earth needs to mend To Bare Witness Take a stand Show your voice Together we band For we have no choice But to bare witness To our own desolation Hoodwinked Cheated deceived swindled We've all been hoodwinked A long long time ago The democrats and republicans Devilishly sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future generations Consume Less Running from here to there And then back again and again For this that and all the other Silly useless and wasteful things We no longer are looking to share Like we did way back when Almost everyone helped one another Lost is the happiness this brings Open yourself try voluntary simplicity Learning to consume less is so freeing Show the corporations no complicity Slow down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation A masterful job where PR firms strive And a dumbing down of education Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The place media conglomerates strive And all Hollywood produces obfuscation Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The part for politicians so desperately strive A government act of incautious deliberation Tinkering With Divine Creation Playing with deadly radiation Like a bunch of babbling babies Tinkering with divine creation Never caring about all the maybes Trying to genetically engineer life While your own species goes extinct Lying to hide all inequitable strife When to Earth you are forever linked The Oligarchy Desperate ubiquitous inequalities Executed by the privileged few Horrendous nightmarish actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we act in time Restore the earth or you'll be Taken away to make it fine Distorted Views Misinformation disinformation Cover ups and lies It doesn't matter which administration They're all cut from the same pies Distorted views Slanted news It'll make you numb What right to choose You'll only lose Are the thoughts of some One Every Second They're dying of starvation One every second They're praying for salvation From the misery there born in But we turn our backs Having our own problems getting by Avoiding the horrid facts While the 3rd world babies cry Till death The Beings From Afar The beings from afar Must look at us and laugh Just babies in evolution Crawling down extinction's path John Lennon You made me write the words I do I'll even admit I idolized you Your assassination ended an era so they say But your message still lives in me each day And I'll reach the masses because I feel That certain destruction is for real If our ways don't change from what is now And stop the killing weapons we let allow Oh the hypocrisy we let go on The human civilization ends with a con With shortsighted leaders sedating us all Technology betrays with apathy we fall As Confusion Creeps In Coming down on your self As confusion creeps in Forgetting pain ruining health What is moral what is sin Each day blurs by Does anything really matter Alone sometimes I cry Wondering will tomorrow be sadder The Atomic Hump Five evolution's to get it right And here we go again Constantly in conflict and fight I think it's time to say when Enough is enough I'm bored of the game Drop the act of being tough Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end

Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn

Standing on this earth that gave me strength to laugh and run I recall how land and sky were innocence and joy I saw the sunrise every morning as a boy I grew up on a dairy farm in northern New South Wales Dad and us would watch the sunrise from the old cowbails Life was mostly dreaming then of things that I would do Now I've been and done them all and come back home to you - and now I know This land is part of me This earth, it is my Mother This ground my feet embrace This land, it is my home This land was cleared to make a farm and raise a family We all moved on and now the land is planted back in trees But land and sky and you and I are one eternal plan I saw the sunrise here this morning as a man I know that life is asking me to love you without fear Caring for the land and sky and all that we hold dear Brothers, sisters, everywhere, come let me take your hand We can live in harmony, belonging to the land - and we can say (Repeat chorus) #23 THE FANTASY Now, here's a little tale of a fantasy that I had one night in the pub Saw a very funny fella with his hair gone yella and a face like a witchety grub (looked liked Yoder) He said: I'm gonna take you to a place where you can get everything you want and some I said: I don't ordinarily do such things but I just might possibly come Well, he took me to a place where there were boys and girls all dressed in satin and lace And the one that came to meet me had a very alluring, titillating face I could see that she was keen on me and being rather nervous I was frozen where I stood I thought: what ordinarily wouldn't happen

and ends sometime late saturday morning If I hadn't fallen down the stairs and sullied myself I'd still be at it tonight but sometimes mental incontinence is not a good thing I was saying things like I want a blue drink I want a green drink and the last clear memory I had was a dim voice down a long dark hall saying--don't drink that so I was being belligerent with a big guy It's the kind of thing that happens when things are not happening well and I'm the king of things that aren't happening I kind of came to when I was fucking my neighbor in the flower bed beauty strikes deep and then truth chases her naked across the street someone called the police but they said it was a domestic matter and that's what I like about New Orleans you can chase your girlfriend naked across the street and not get arrested and in the morning you can talk about it to someone who knows what you're talking about but I move in a magic circle with magic friends and I know that god has pulled us out of the hat to entertain a world full of people who don't know the trick and no matter how many steering wheels go to sleep in our arms we always wake up in our own cars in our own clothes in a city that's still on a map with a phone number and an address in our pocket we've all got powers that no one knows about and even when they're weak they work but my best days were spent in a crossfire between a coma and a photoflash long slow afternoons next to a girl with makeup on her panties and all her cruelties mysteriously spent elswhere I don't know where so don't interupt me sometimes my only goal is not to let a blackout last for more than 10 seconds and sometimes it's two days before I find out my car keys were in my shoes I'm 44 which is 17 in Yoda years It took me a long time to figure out the trick because it's not just one trick we need a suitcase of tricks to get by but it's hard to catch yourself in the middle of it that's why we try catch each other because everything has it's own velocity sometimes it's vertical and sometimes it's earth speed which is undetectable but static is like a glaze thorn in my head and sometimes waiting in a room is unforgivable and I'm tired of writing I'm bored I'm armed I don't feel like talking I've smuggled the secrets out of the bad place but I'm not sure whose side is who so I'll go down any street just see what's there because it's never a walk about what's here it's always about what's there and there's some guy talking on a cell phone with an audible dial tone and he's saying \" I'd give you a ride in my jet but it's in Columbia right now\" so maybe if he came in on a donkey with palm leaves in his beard I'd give him a free drink but that's the moment when suddenly god becomes temporary and I realize No he's not fucking with me he's just being stupid and it's my own personal Heck so maybe it's not going to be great maybe it's just gonna be crazy this way who cares so much for philosophy it's all gone soft and this's gettin too close to heaven I need to take a break I might be bitter but I'm not pissy and we're gonna keep on getting crazy VODKA, GRACE &amp; CHAKRAS I want to be the Yoda of cash --feel the money Luke I want a little vodka grace and kisses to fuel the chakras I want to see my hands when I dream I'm tired of all the cautious sorcery I want to trade in my righteousness for an ashtray or some other famous mystery apocalypse is the only game I'll play or I won't play at all it's a repetition of unpredictables a vacation from explanations just one big fat whatever designed to be erased

a god out there but if there is I'd appreciate her help I always imagine her to be some kind of lock-down goddess like the butter lady on the butter box I just want to get stupid up in california roll up a left-hander and revolve right back into the fucking wack-fucked primal fucking ooze no clock no phone no light until I'm done that'll put a nice little slant on your DNA --don't do it if you want to keep it but I can't hang on to everything I'll just keep it up until my ability to see patterns gets a little too amped and everything gets so omenistic I just keep thinkin' about it matter of fact I'm afraid that something paranormal could be putting its landing gear down in my naked neo-cortex even as we speak but it's not gettin' done by my head because I'm not thinking I'm not learning I'm remembering I'm enlightened but I don't know how correct I am there are maps of the enormous submerged in every moment and when they perpetrate the brilliance and I want it all to be stupid because I'm amazed by how assured everyone is such a beautiful collection of faces for each other fresh young minds in a fine young world, yeah, that'll last about half a block it's all the strangled hysterics of a culture emptied of its magic a people whose rituals no longer resonate with the unseen sleep walking in that bare oblivion something so furiously empty it's always been devouring itself a blast pit mandala in a circle of souls on an empty night that became empty afternoons again angel of oppression I know who I am I've been saved all-to-hell by a phone voice on hold and I've been looking through a window propped open with a clock ticking down to zero and I've been slamming the receiver down relentlessly tell me what's art so I can stop doing it how long will my soul have to be inside out before it can be outside in I can feel my reflection move like a secret equator around one of my immensely dangerous selves angels fly away from the blast but I can't to say which one is coming and which one is going away I got a whole precarious sartori situation goin' on I still have a language I just don't have the words and today no longer feels like any day matter of fact it doesn't feel like anything at all It feels like one of those days in between days first beginnings are always the same always in excess there isn't much more so let me go on it's 3 in the afternoon and I'm drunk as fucking mardi-gras with a bunch of strangers who love me and I'm losing my shit to a sad song on a jukebox in a bar I don't even know I'm just in it and I know that the fate that left me here will come back to pick me up this city is temptation at it's finest and sometimes you got to put a hole in the wall just to see what's going on no bad about it I've had strange environments before but I'm safe in New Orleans now just bring me presents and call me daddy because time flies when we're having fun and it stops when we say stop but time just keeps passing us by and doesn't talk to anyone and we can't say stop we can't say anything at all and time never turns off NO TITLE NO NAME \"the loneliness is sating\" -- Rilke I think too much My mind is constantly banking from thought to thought in a long graceful slur toward a more distant orbit swarming with the mystic and insane and floating among the rusted spines of angels but my mind is a beautiful engine that will always take me places even long after it breaks down there's an aloneness that comes with intelligence but it's not an emptiness it's a solitude that fills everything and there's a terror that comes with knowing but it's a terror without paranoia or conspiracy and there's the pain with great knowledge comes great pain but that great pain is constantly stretching its fingertips across the skin of great pleasure in the most beautiful and most final form of S &amp; M but those whom the gods would destroy they must first drive mad those whom they drive mad they must first haunt those whom they haunt they must first talk to and the tongues of gods speak in all things both great and small and all things count in big amounts but those who've been destroyed are no longer haunted -- to those who've been destroyed the voices simply talk and so we're left somewhere between the answers that gather and the answers that float always drifting sideways between the past stretched out into a gray light behind us and the future falling away into that invisible and uneasy space of silent and mysterious escapes but even when we release the old ghosts from old places and allow all things to be right We still slip in a thin vapor between the constellating sky and the crystallizing ground between the stars they say are above us and the so-called dirt they say is beneath us I \ndon't really know I just keep talking I don't know if I'm a guru a little down on his luck or a street clown with a limp going broke on decateur street truth is I'm probably still slipping somewhere between the two of them so maybe it's that moment between an unplanned kiss and the moment you think about it or maybe its that moment between that one thing about how you're both really different and the other thing when you're both really drunk we're nothing but mirrors of each other but until you've seen a thing empty you'll never know what it's filled with the eyes are the window of the soul if you don't see what you want in the window go inside and ask THE BOOK OF FEVERS it's 7:56 on a second floor Sunday morning in New Orleans I lean back in my chair on the balcony bottom of my feet up on the cool metal rail just cool enough to let me know I'm still alive and my body is still warm and the sun shines on the bottom of my feet just hot enough to let me know that my body has cooled down to the heat of life and not death just enough to let me know I'm back in the world of warmth and light tiny birds shadowed but not quite blue or black snap erratically through the air swinging their tiny yoyo lives around that invisible string whose other end is firmly looped around god's middle finger my left ball rolls down through the huge rip in my shorts slow and easy until it touches down on the cold metal chair and draws back up into the persistant warmth of the body skin and hair still damp and sticky from two days of fever and hallucinations unconcious and alone I peal off my shirt and let my belly buddha in the sun let the sweet beeze from the top branches in the trees lift away what's left of two days of urinous sweat five times I've had these fevers alone unconcious in a bed or on a floor for days with no one around waking thin and weak shaking like a baby and I know what the earth is doing she's been getting me ready she's preparing me to undergo a complicated alchemy where I won't have the words or hear the voices and I won't see the hands or feel the faces and she's teaching me how to die the way it's always done alone my first fever came when I was seven and when it was over my eyes were blurred hearing numbed the finger tips moved without me and after that came all the other crazy fevers fevers in flophouses and rotten rooms sweating it all out uncontrollably soaked in purities and impurities ruining sheets and beds while the real part of me abstracted itself into the world elsewhere branding my mind with visions and then there were the biochem fevers the bad acid that left me cramped and shaking fingernails cold an blue and the good acid that took me out of my mind and then took my mind out of my body and left me float on that invisible blue tether fragile as a kite in the electric current of this collosal universe where faces fade into smoke and the smoke fades into twilight and the twilight fades into deep space as the stars go out one at a time and then suddenly all at once as it all falls into the void but after I had gone there once every journey back into this world is somehow more than just being born again and somehow less because a fever is a starship that burns the spirit for fuel but God's just getting messy with me and he's made me the poster child for spirtiual birth defects freshly awakened from that burned out vision but everything that didn't quit kill me off in this world left me more insane and airborne in the next left the rest of me more alive in that unbearable grace across the street an old lady is pushing a cart of groceries her body is frail and wieghted down she stops for a moment looks up at me and we both nod to each other and when she lifts up her head her smile just floats in the air like a little girl and for a moment of no particular time or length I see her face as a young woman and the humanity of it all overwhelms me and I have the great tears inside until I feel my left ball on cold metal again and I realize my balls are still hanging out but sometimes it's like that I'm with a friend or a total stranger and we both nod at the same time about anythng or nothing at all and what it is doesn't matter it never matters all that matters is that we both wanted the other to be right at the same time everyone wants to be the exception but there are no exceptions the years go by in the billions and we don't I'm not saying this because it happens I'm saying \"this\" because many things happen and I don't want the answer I don't need to know the answer all I need is something that will make me stop asking the question GOODBYE in a goodbye to some rare blue our sleep is taken out of context floating quietly in place without us beneath our dark and silent arms any dream of knowing winds aimlessly away under the twisting stars and their alcohols aching with unfinished happinesses our eyes are \nslowly filling with a drowned light the old photographs overflow and endure the old dream of dying alone in the weather beneath the pursuing forms the moon sings lightly in a black sleepless dress as it leans against a bare woman swaying down and farther down beyond any dream of knowing just let the rain come in in between here and when we left an old photoflash will empty the heart as it shrinks back into place and the days will grow roomy which is just \"too bad\" in a

what happens to me is Savage and these show turn it into a game or sport that everyone gets involved in [] Jodi a manager bending over right in front of me her butt looking very inviting indeed I felt like touching her Saturday the 15th that I woke at about 9am going back to sleep due to being right out of it very dazed and concuss not being able in geting up until 1pm not feeling much better my chemical balance was very poor with my emotions totally different to yesterday when I was motivated, delighted, today I felt very unmotivated and somewhat depressed [normal for Saturday] and that nothing I had planned to do was worth while all day thinging \"not a chance never ever\" {this is like sadism} I had planned to go outside and do some more work on my car, then get a train into Brisbane for the day yet couldn't just stood and walked in my room like a zombie with my brain seized, at 3pm I walked to Australia Fair posting a letter to National Australia Bank then while walking back to use the internet I seen Elwin who stopped talking to me again about the share market not listening to anything I said most of the time just ignoring whatever I said specially whereever I said anything about America and there cost of living, he ended saying that he will make back his looses on the stock market as he said this I instantly throught what I have been thinking for some time that Elwin gets money for interfering with me as I tried leaving he change the subject and kept me from getting away, [over the last last few weeks I have had the stuffing knocked out of myself physically and emotionaly] I then went to use the internet megan didn't seem all that happy in seeing me like she was last week and looked like she had a guilty consceinous, as I started I visited my site noticing that I had over 250 hits over the past week 120 of those to a new page I put on only last week and as yet I haven't added into any index, I checked the National visa center site to check the winner of a compition I entered some weeks ago to find that a person named Evans had won todays draw there has been 1 winner per day for the last 6 weeks, as I tried saving this page my floppy disk was destroyed, then when I tried connecting to my email site I received a time expired message this happened twice before I could connect, after I finished megan said see you latter, I went into coles where I had no idea what I wanted to buy unable in remembering my head was spinning around I couldn't communicate at all mixing words up when I did speak, Jodi a manager bending over right in front of me her but looking very inviting indeed I felt like touching her butt yet just couldn't force myself to do so, I put a loto registration in at the newsagency the male who took it was an old male with fair grey hair who said \"you don't pay for it until you get it\" I wondered what he was talking about instantly thinking of the Moreli's, I sat outside for some time not knowing what I was doing there [like a zombie] before I walked back to my room where all most immediatly I laid down on my bed I was just totally exhausted feeling like I did when the Olypmics were on in 1996 when my body couldn't coup with any more then an hour a day and needed to ly down many times daliy, I woke feeling very depressed, thinking is this all there is to my life, Quality of live very poor today, with pain being tremendous I was that brain dead today I kept thinking how am I going to have any sort of life while I am like this, [Florid court awards over 250 Billion Dollars to class action againist

I got up at 10.45am once again feeling a little better than yesterday after not being able in sleeping until about 2am, I stood and walked around room foe an hour not really knowing what I was doing yet better than most Sundays, at almost 1pm I went outside did my washing and did some work on my car repairing some rust spots on my car, Peter and Doug came along at different times Peter had a change in his voice when he seen me working on my car saying \"it seem to creep up on them if you don't keep up the maintenance\" Doug came back saying \"you got this bomb going yet\" I grunted saying \"no\" he smiled\" saying \"thats alright\" after finishing my washing went back into my room before I walked to Australia Fair where I went into coles to do some shopping the same female security guard as last week brushed up against me as she past me she looked very nice with her hair back and plated, I was served by Hayley, then went and sat down outside coles where Mardy came along and talked for a few minutes before I went and posted my letters I had written last night one too Queensland Transport, Jessica Zaghet, Gold Coast Hospital, Medicare, Dr. Kelly, Centrelink, the one for Dr. Kelly I walked down Marine Parade putting it under the door then posting the \nrest nearby I had intended posting them in Nerang Street yet forget to do so when I walked past the Mail box, on the way to Dr. Kelly's I past a woman in a phone box who had a faded pair of blue jeans on and a body that filled them was beautiful she turned and looked, smiled as I past yet I just kept walking the inner me wanted to reach out and torch her yet I just couldn't on the way back she was still there this time she moved her hips and legs as I past and again I just walked past, this horrifies and traumatises me how I just walk in the opposite direction when a situation like this ever presentees itself I feel like I am completely under control no matter how much I try to reach out I just can't this rips the insides out of myself, I walked back to my room where I was all very happy I felt this was a false emotion specially after what had just happened kept thinking tonight \"just remember that no one is perfect\" \"you still don't get it do you you will never have any woman in your live\" rattling of keys in hallway many conversation in hallway too while I was watching Conspiracy

felt numb with no feeling in my Penis which was shriviled up too a third of its normal size with the feeling of the muscles being contracted by nerve stimulation and due too my body chemistry] my eyes stung, I got up going to work on walking to the bus I was wobbly on my feet as I got off the bus I noticed my legs would ache when I walked up a slight rise, at work today I had trouble thinking, couldn't urinate most of day, Dave Tag came to me with a list of parts to cut for the Tasi Oak job saying \"the 1500 was wrong it needs to be 1600 then added how good it looked then adding a phrase, expression that wasn't relevant to the job \"Its got to be done\", on the radio the songs that played on 909fm \"you better be home soon\" others I can't remember, the weather report \"were going for 16\" at morning tea Dave Tag sat next to me clearing his throat very time the number 16 was said by someone etc, etc, then brodie walked past me saying \"were all square now\" I was at 1.30pm while thinking of 250 Billion Dollar payout that tobacco campanies are facing in Florida and that this is the reason that Michael Schumaker was given a bad deal in the Austrian GP which wasn't inacordance with the rules of Formula One when the race went into safty car status at the accident on the first corner which took Schumackers Ferrari out of the race which should of been stopped alowing schumacker to restart in the spare car, I felt a shock inside my forehead I became concuss, right out of it had NO idea what I was doing very wobbly on my feet \"I feel what has happened to me over the past 2 years has influenced the payout in Florida\", again this afternoon Dave Tag came to me with parts of the Tasi Oak job saying how good it looked then adding a phrase, expression that wasn't relevant to the job \"Its got to be done\" whenever I thought of a woman within minutes I would think \"you still don't get it do you you'l never have a woman\" after work I walked to treetops walking past MJ Evans I waved at Mike Evans he never accknologed me with any gesture, on the way I thought I give Macdonalds a miss today yet when I got there I went in and bought a complete meal a

alarm a travel clock I felt that I had under gone electric shock treatment durring the hours I was asleep on getting up I felt so weak that weak my whole body was in pain and I could hardly move my body and limbs I thought of taking the day off yet never walking off to meet the bus at about 5.20am I also felt that I had a touch of sinusitis once getting off the bus I walked to work this being the hardist walk I have done for some time every step was an enormous effect at about 3/4 distance Dave P drove past picking me up and saving me the hardest part of the walk, just after arriving Tony was near his \nnew Panel saw I happen to mention that the saws we get sharpened aren't as good as the ones old one on this saw as Tony said \"just get rid of them and go back to the old saw doctor\" I for some rwason couldn't look Tony in the eye my eyes down downwards I felt awful, working to day was hard every step I took was an agonizing effect my brain was operating as slow as my body was my head was boiling hot after work I walked to treetops where I went to Macdonalds as I went to walk in there was an tall old male with a moustache who started an harassing whistle as soon as he seen me he was walking out of Macdonlads I thought what is his problem and felt violated then as I received the coffee I ordered the woman with brown hair said \"see you later\" I thought whats going on here thinking of Karen Canon instantly, I then went to the newsagency where I asked about a magizine name computer shopper the US version the young woman telling me that there were 2 listed yet one was unavailable in queensland the manager rang his supplier ordering a copy then told me it was the UK version I had just told him that I only wanted the US version and no other I walked away again wondering what was going on here instantly thinking of Gaynor Davis, on the way back to Southport today it wasn't until after the bus reached Broad Beach that my face became numb and I started getting concuss regaining consciousness at the Sundale Hotel where george lives after getting off the bus I walked straight back to my room where I needed to sit down I was that lifeless with no energy

dishes made of locally hearth-baked clay-technology of Romans and others was lost The Decline of Feudalism Not known what broke isolation and integrity of feudal Europe- not a single event- not a normally disturbing war, a new tool or weapon, an invasion by tribal barbarians, or whatever May have been a series of bad crops, greater hunger, neglect of crops- something that lowered the welfare of manors Cycle of adversity- something led to the greatest mass movement in history- the First Crusade- evidence of acute social discontent emerges in 11th century, a new ideology- a spirit of asceticism- fasting, self-abasement, pilgrimages to Jerusalem, wave of salvation seeking- escape from social realities Originally, pilgrimages were by discontented feudal lords - even encouraged by Pope Urban II- get rid of discontents Some clearly made money from pilgrimages idea of freeing Holy Land from Moslem rule- would have been profitable as well Those who went with lords were not content to live as serfs again Crusades also got rid of malcontents- goal of freeing the Holy Land was a good sell Allowed new leadership to develop while lord was absent, serfs were able to assume new roles- as soldiers and in absence of the lord Many manors joined together to go on pilgrimages and later for Crusades- also mingled serfs- decried their situation Exposure to culture of Muslims also enlightening Crusading masses needed food, shelter, and roads for travel- old Roman towns revived, new trading and craft centers developed, new political units emerged, manors merged Technology, ideology began to change- at first slowly By 15th century- Florence burst-military technology, building construction, religious organization- complex marriage Great complexity, unpatterned variability, and regional character of change emerges Historical stereotyping- Renaissance, Middle Ages, Industrial Revolution- all simply labels not reality 20th century- Age of Science- but it is much more- industrialization, technology, and much more- science also goes back to the Greeks- could be media age, age of television- no one description tells story Age of Chivalry- 11 and 12th centuries- - King Arthur- lofty and honorable endeavors- rescuing ladies, jousting with equally honorable knights- few actually were knights, some off fighting Crusades, others grabbing lands, empire building Revival of Familism Family form of social organization Extended, nuclear- seems to survive change Chinese family - 2000 years, Roman- several centuries As feudal system of organization disintegrated, family survived and maintained social life, not dominant as in China, but survived Family first line of defense against change Gave individual island of stability Assumed function of procreation, physical maintenance, of socialization, of social control Comparable to frontier US- hostile forces, dependent upon own resources, and faced with constant adversity- alone one could not survive- family allowed survival Postfeudal family was patriarchal, women chattel As a form of social organization- well suited to resist change- advantage- no schools to subvert, total jurisdiction over family- born into it, spent whole of early years within it, and entirely dependent upon it during those years- provide intimacy, training, socialization- family also managed deviants Many methods to circumscribe individual- contractual marriages, controlling work, controlling experiences Freedom for women- become nun, for men, priest or soldier- family could no longer control Like women, men also bound by family- accepted mate chosen for them, worked land given to them, followed orders of elders until became elder- from teen years weighted down by responsibility for wife and children, prevented from venturing out on own Women tied to - many children, married quite young, worked with husband&#146;s family Power of dead hand of the past Organizational devices and procedures of extended family operated to preoccupy the individual and to preclude his straying from the tired and true- rituals of births, death, \nmarriages- demanding and time consuming as were family anniversaries - lots of time and money- typical wedding times ten Family tended to discourage individual mobility, keep tied to place and status Even if peasant boy left home and made fortune in town or town boy went to large city to make fortune- forced to divide it among so many relatives- hardly worth the effort- still true today in Italian villages, more one earns, more demanded- Elvis, Muhammad Ali Decline of Familism Still strong in Italy, Spain, parts of Germany, and in Scandinavia, and Hispanic cultures- was in 18th century US, dominated in South, Northern colonies, especially in New England, and still is among peasants all over the world Industrial Revolution broke extended family -modern media, technology all aided Children left home to work in factories in cities Geographic mobility probably greatest cause of breakdown of family Roman Catholic Church aided this breakdown- children could join orders, escape families- transfer filially- Church grew- so did corruption- led to Reformation Either church led to greater social advancement than did family Rise of Church aided by rise of towns and trade and new forms of social organization that made towns possible Town life did not weaken family, it offered alternatives, new and exciting lives Family no longer self-sufficient- buy bread from bakers, shoes from shoe maker, cloth from weavers, work more and more separate from family School system also separated from family Every improvement in transportation and communications weakened the family No longer rural hamlet or isolated farm A century ago- road from home two ruts though field- foot, horseback, or horse-drawn wagon- later a railroad, steamboat Few visitors, occasionally a new school teacher, priest, some drummers Weekly newspapers if at all, read Farmer&#146;s Almanac for bulletins Today, it takes minutes to get information around the world, everyone knows someone who has been to far away places, fashions no longer take years to reach people, news is immediate, hard to isolate oneself- mass processing, mass distribution, public utilities, mass television Ideological support for independence from family support slow in coming Even today typical to honor home, mother, wife, and children Life is not like that- invaded by tax collectors, countless charities, solicitors of all sorts, building inspectors, mortgage holders, children do not seem to honor parents, do not follow parent&#146;s values Idea that sons, especially extra sons, might go off for adventure emerges much later- farm to town pattern- migrant expected to return with riches or in due time to family left behind, most if left simply built near parents on farm and stayed under thumb Not until end of last century that a woman in US, Britain, Northern Europe might leave close family attachments without being suspect- normal role still that of wife, housewife, and mother- still were some independent women The Bourgeois and Other Atypical Family Systems Extended family associated with stability Nuclear family with change Yet family in less developed societies may be nuclear Clearly even extended family societies experience change Western Societies, extended family broke down as major changes occurred Reformation, development of major cities, breakup of extended families all at same time Individuals won recognition in careers etc. -where were their
