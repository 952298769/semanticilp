blood vessels and nerves - the skin is made up of two major parts: Dermis - bottom layer of the skin - divided up into two main parts - reticular layer - deepest part of the dermis - continuous with the hypodermis - forms a mat of elastin and collagen fibers that are oriented primarily in one direction, called clevage or tension lines - orientation of clevage lines are based on skin stress due to movement - incisions made parallel to clevage lines heal faster than those perpendicular - papillary layer - superior part of the dermis - contains finger-like projections (papillae) that extend into the epidermis - increase surface area - highly vascularized Epidermis - the most superior layer of skin - composed primarily of stratified squamous epithelial cells - most of which are keratinocytes - produce keratin, a protein that makes cells stronger and more waterproof - some are melanocytes - produce the skin pigment melanin - contains no blood vessels - nutrients get to the epidermal cells by diffusion from the dermis - new epidermal cells are produced in the deepest layers of the epidermis - as new cells form, they push older cells up - as these cells are pushed up, they become squamate (flattened) and filled with keratin - cells die as they become keratinized and move away from the blood supply - these dead, keratinized cells provide a non-living barrier and are sloughed off (desquamate) - the epidermis is divided into strata, based upon changes that occur to the cells - Stratum Germanitivum (Basale) - deepest portion of the epidermis - attached to the superior border of dermis - single layer of cuboidal or columnar cells - undergo mitosis to produce the other, superior strata - hairless regions have Merkel cells - touch-sensitive sensory cells - contain the melanocytes - Stratum Spinosum - superior to stratum basale - appear &quot;spiny&quot; due to the shrinking of the cytoplasm during the fixing process - Stratum Granulosum - &quot;grainy layer&quot; - cells start accumulating granules of keratin - superior to stratum spinosum - 2-5 layers of semi-flattened cells - cells begin to die here - Stratum Lucidum - thin, &quot;clear&quot; strata superior to the stratum granulosum - dead cells are surrounded by keratin fibers - only found in thick skin (palms /soles) - Stratum Corneum - most superficial layer of epidermis - 25 or more layers of cornifiied cells - dead cells with a hard envelope of keratin proteins Accessory Skin Structures Hair - dead, keratinized epithelial cells arranged in three concentric layers - divided into the shaft (above skin) and the root (below the skin) - attached to arrector-pili muscles - smooth muscle that elevates hair in response to cold or fear Sebaceous (Oil) Glands - located in the dermis - connected

cells and memory T cells remain ready in case the same virus invades again Immunity = state of being resistant to a specific disease Acquired immunity -any form of immunity that is not innate ( present at birth ) but is obtained during life Natural passive immunity -passed from mother to child before birth or immediately after birth through breast milk Natural active immunity -development of antibodies through an attack of an infectious substance Artificial passive immunity -acquired by receiving antiserum containing antibodies from another host Acquired active immunity -artificially acquired immunity through vaccination or immunization Better health usually means that ones immune system can respond effectively disease usually strikes when the immune system is compromised health can be compromised by: l-Age -older individuals are usually more susceptible to new diseases even though they may have a large amount of acquired immunity 2-Heredity -genes and genetic disorders can effect the immune systems ability to respond 3-Disease can cause one to become more susceptible to other diseases (AIDS) 4- Bad habits such as smoking which leads to diseased lungs Macrophage -phagocytic cells which protects the body by ingesting invading cells and interacting with other immune system cells Histiocytes -large macrophages found loose in connective tissue Immunoglobulins each contain a constant region of amino acids which is always set -but not identical among all antibodies each immunoglobulin also contains a variable region- where the amino acid sequence Varies between antibodies -they form the antigen binding site which is Specific to each individual antigen Immunoglobulins (Ig) -antibodies made by plasma cells -five distinctive antibodies in serum and external secretions of the bodyl- lmmunoglobulin A -19A -major Ab in mucous membrane lining of the intestine and in the Bronchii, saliva, and tears 2-Immunoglobulin D -IgD -small amounts in serum 3-lmmunoglobulin E -19E -in lungs, skin, cells of mucous membranes 4-lmmunoglobulin G -( IgG) -( most common) response to invasion by bacteria, fungi, and vlruses 5-Immunoglobulin M -(lgM) -first immunoglobulin produced when the body is challenged by an antigen T cell and Cell Mediated Immunity 2 main types of T cells: cytotoxic T cells -responsible for cell mediated immunity -b/c they bring about the Destruction of antigen bearing cells Contain storage vacuoles -contain perforin = perforate plasma membrane - Allowing water and salts to enter and cause the cell to burst Helper T cells -regulate immunity by enhancing response of other immune cells Upon antigen exposure -they enlarge and secrete cytokines -stimulate Molecules that cause helper T cells to divide and other immune cells to perform their function H1V infects helper T cells -to inactivate the immune system \nActivation of T cells When T cells leave the thymus they have receptors but cannot recognize the antigen by Themselves The antigen is presented to them by APC -antigen presenting cells -usually macrophages Which engulf and break down pathogens to fragments within an endocytic vesicle the fragments are linked to a major histocompatability complex (MHC) protein in the plasma Membrane that can be presented to a T cell Human MHC proteins are called fILA (human leukocyte associated) antigens -b/c they mark the cell as belonging to a particular individual -fILA are self antigens membrane attack complex: -Lysis is the destruction of a cell by penetrating the cell wall and allowing fluid to fill the cell, eventually causing the cell to rupture Interferon -family of proteins released by cells when invaded by a virus -signals noninfected cells to form an antiviral protein to stop or slow viral multiplication -interferon is species specific therefore only human interferon can be used in humans Specific Defenses: antigen -any foreign substance that stimulates the immune system to react to it Immune system is able of distinguishing self from nonself immunity can last for a long time -Immunity is the result of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes B lymphocytes mature in the red bone marrow Give rise to plasma cells which produce antibodies -which are proteins capable Of combining and neutralizing antigens -the antibodies are secreted into the blood, lymph, and other body fluids T lymphocytes ( T cells )produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus coordinate immune defenses and kill organisms which necessary Helper T cells -secrete substances that stimulate the production of antibodies by B cells Suppressor T cells -stop B cell activity when no longer needed Memory T cells -remembers specific antigens for the stimulation of a faster and more intense response if the antigen appears later Lymphokines -chemicals produced by the T cells -are signals between the cells of the immune system to attract macrophages and prepare them to attack lymphocytes recognize antigens because they have receptors molecules on their surface the shape of the reseptors on any given lymphocyte is complementary to a specific antigen -the antigen and receptor fit like a &quot;lock and key&quot; Their is a different lymphocyte for every possible antigen B cells and Antibody-Mediated Immunity 1-",2.1860361099243164],["UV light causes skin cells to produce more of a
