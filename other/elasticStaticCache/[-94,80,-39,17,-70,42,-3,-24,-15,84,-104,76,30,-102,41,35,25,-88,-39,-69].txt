Earth's crust divided into three rock types based on origin: a) igneous - formed directly by solidification of molten lava (e.g. granite, basalt, volcanic rock) b) sedimentary - formed by deposition and consolidation of weathered products of other rocks ( e.g. limestone, sandstone, shale) c) metamorphic - formed by metamorphosis, or change in form, of other rocks (e.g. quartzite, slate, marble, gneisses, schists) ii) Soils - Origin of soil (see Figure 17.1 ): i) rocks are weathered to regolith (or rock rubble) ii) subsequent physical processes (e.g. freeze/thaw cycles, wind, water), chemical processes, and biological processes -
