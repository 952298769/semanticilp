Ryan Wainio A few short hours ago I went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, just to make a sandwich And I knew if I just had some Spam I wouldn't have to use cheese and ham And maybe I'd be happy for a while But something I saw made me quiver I caught the odor of rotten liver Bad food on the first rack The broccoli was turning black I can't remember if I cried When I saw the cheese was old and dried But something made me really sad The day the food went bad So Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze Even the mayonnaise was stinkin' like somethin' died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die Well, do you like to eat olives And if you do, do you want \nsome, I've had enough Even though they're a few years old Do you put cheese on a dinner roll Can the Packers win the Super Bowl And can you reach me from my trance, I don't know Well our janitor is really dim Cause he sees us eating in the gym Oh, he says he doesn't know Why we don't eat on the tables I got bologna stuck between my teeth When I ate it this morning in my pickup truck And I know that I wasn't glad The day the food went bad I started singing Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze The corn-on-the cob was stinking like something died And everything is moldy and dry This might be the day that I die Now for 10 days I was gone from home Now there's mold that looks like it was purposely grown But that's not how it came to be My neighbor Chester came for some jelly beans But instead he got a bowl of ice cream I had rice that came from Milwaukee Oh, and while my back was turned away Chester ran off with my ice tray I caught him just before He could get out of the door And my two lemons made some rude remarks They weren't yellow, but really dark And there's a feeling that I had The day my food went bad It was stinking Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even tangerines were stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die I used to like to eat bread and butter The bird flew off to see his brother Eight pieces of pie, rotting fast And the ham is foul, so I think I'll pass Cake with three layers, it's time has passed And then Chester ate some cheese and he got gas And my appetite even still resumed But, I don't think I'll be eating anything soon Now I have stomach cramps Ooh, but I'd rather eat a postage stamp Then my fingers touched a banana peel Now I can't have a decent meal I had to go through an ordeal The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock at thirty-seven degrees Even sauerkraut was stinkin' like something died Think of all the food I'll have to buy It almost makes a guy wanna' cry Well the fridge had stunk up the whole place The refrigeration was a big disgrace With no food left to eat at all So, come on it's a symbol of my life My hungers cutting me up like a knife And I picked up a carrot, it wouldn't bend Oh and as I stood there by the fridge The cheese fell off of the second ridge There's no mouse in hell That would eat that cheese that fell And as the time climbed here into the night You'd say the day just wasn't right I couldn't satisfy my appetite The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even the applesauce was stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry And this could be the day when I die I went door to door and got on my knees And I begged them for some ham and cheese But they just laughed and they turned away I went down to the grocery store Where I'd bought the cheese from weeks before But the bird there said the cheese was out of stock He showed me meats and corn that's canned Some of them creamed, and some generic brand But now my heart was breaking All the cheese was taken So the three kinds that I eat the most American, Swiss, and Colby Jack They were on a freight train on the tracks The day the food went bad I started thinking From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy Everything in my fridge is stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die And now I'm thinkin' From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy Everythin' in my fridge was stinking like somethin'died And now everything is moldy and dry MY MAIN PAGE",0.4146234393119812],["although they have a

Center With this came a new focus: people from Central Appalachia, rural communities of TN, NC, VA, WV, and KY Participatory Research at Highlander Began in the 1970 s Highlander began to organize around issues of environmental pollution and health problems, ownership of land, taxation, and occupational safety A library was developed as a resource center to assist individuals and groups to do their own research for communities in which they were involved Research projects began to document records involving coal companies Those fighting toxic waste dumps sought out Highlander s help These researchers became educators for communities experiencing problems of this nature The Bumpass Cove Story Bumpass Cove was a former mining community that shut down in 1961 There is a stream that runs through this community which supplies food and drinking water for area residents The close of the mines caused people to be unemployed -people \nwere then excited when Bumpass Cove Environmental Control and Mineral Co. announced that they were going to resume mining and use the previously mined areas as landfills -the mining never happened, but garbage was brought to the landfill sites After the landfill began, strange things began to happen -trucks came in at night without their lights on and rolled barrels into the creek -vegetation began to die around the area -the incinerator (unlicensed) began to emit noxious fumes and smoke -people began getting new illnesses -wildlife was dying Most people ignored what was happening except for Hobart Storey who wrote letters to the TN Department of Public Health asking them to investigate (he was ignored) Crisis happened: people went to church one Sunday morning and people began passing out due to the fumes -most of the community then became involved, standing in the road not allowing trucks to pass and putting nails on bypass roads -three months later, the landfill closed Later, they found that hazardous chemicals had been placed in the landfill and they were leaching out into the groundwater and the creek After this, people came together and started a workshop through the Highlander for people who were experiencing hazardous waste problems A couple from Bumpass Cove went to the Department of Public Health and attempted to sort through some files regarding this case.",0.36669376492500305],["Landfill attorneys

And now he isn't careful with his wings I don't see Why he had to go depend on me He tells me all the time that all he wants is to be free Well it's good when it's good and it's bad when it's bad And
