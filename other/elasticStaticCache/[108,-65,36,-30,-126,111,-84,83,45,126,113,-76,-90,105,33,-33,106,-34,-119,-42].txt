stretched over an internal skeleton Endoskeleton composed of ossicles: movable or fixed calcium plates Plates enclosed within living tissue when first formed Bear spines as indicated by phylum`s name Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple but complete: mouth, gut and anus Capable of

organisms with tough, leathery outer skin Most lie on sides at the bottom of the ocean Mouth is located on one end Surrounded by tube feet modified into tentacles Tentacles secrete mucus to trap food particles Calcareous skeleton reduced to widely separated, microscopic plates Have highly branched respiratory trees that originate from cloaca Water brought into and out of cloaca by muscular contractions Gas exchange occurs across the respiratory trees Have tube feet on body, may be restricted to five grooves Move by tube feet or wriggling of the entire body Some forms are hermaphroditic,
