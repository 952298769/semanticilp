not sure why this is or is not happening suggestions that we establish a standing meeting schedule so people can get it on their schedules ahead of time suggest getting a small group together, that could include people outside of this group, to talk about what outreach is and create a matrix to show who is doing what when and where, and how to contact them - this could be put on the web for us to access and could help the University's administration also would like to work with Web Services to pilot a travel report database project and some variation of the preceptor database that would be web accessible need to email the group for input on the types of information needed for these databases using the web to survey and collect information is something that we might want to use more in the future when we have questions in the future about technology support or access to library services Comments regarding survey's organizational/structural questions: John Saultz originally back in 1994 the position of AVP for Regional Education was created by President Kohler for 2 reasons better advice and coordination of the outreach programs we did here find something for him (John) to do currently the University is trying to formulate what the University's approach to outreach ought to be at the same time the University has had to focus on the health care system and its financial performance with our clinical system consequently the University has been less focused on other things, including trying to determine what role we see service to the statewide constituency should be John assumed Dept Chair of Family Medicine about 1 year ago, he also director of the AHEC Program and in charge of the primary care clinical system Regional Ed consists of Mary and a small part of John's time and effort - means we can do about 1.1 FTE worth of stuff trying to make sure that what everybody expected out of Regional Ed was matched by what resources we put into it - it is not going to do much more that it is doing now if it is limited in its resources by what we are putting into it now - we can't get grandiose unless we reorganize things we have the potential to tap into the collaboration of others to help if we are wanting to do a specific project or look at something - we could form small groups of people to work on these things or delegate them some confusion about what we have been doing with Regional Ed that is different from or related to the AHEC program AHEC is a statewide network of health education centers Regional Ed is an internal university issue about how we want to facilitate, support, integrate and build collaborative partnerships around the University's statewide mission concerns that we need to take on some specific projects and programs diversity of opinion about the degree the University ought to centrally manage things like outreach versus the degree the university should be facilitative but not necessarily see organizing outreach as something that is a central issue doesn't seem to be much desire to change Regional Ed from a somewhat decentralized model we have passed the survey up the line to let people like President Kohler see what people think about this Group Comments Housing issues: would like some discussion about what the potential is for collaboration in terms of supporting housing across the state as AHEC money or support decreases, residents easier to sell than students - will discuss at next meeting Time Constraints: use the context of this already established meeting to discuss issues since it is very difficult for members to fit &quot;another subcommittee meeting&quot; into their schedules ie - interdisciplinary training: what are the issues, what are the funding sources, what are the examples on campus, how can we do more of this suggest continuing this discussion as an examination of the issues raised by the survey to get at the root of what the survey is about and what it told us and didn't tell us suggest not having any program updates or program presentations for a few meetings until we can come up with an agenda of some things we want to work on Regional Ed suggests that these meetings don't need to be the only vehicle for doing this these meetings are to catalyze things since we meet quarterly, there are issues that have weekly or monthly importance, not quarterly a 1.",0.6616082787513733],["Priest: Where do we start with a man who is bigger Yet another different Priest: than John was when John did his baptism thing?",0.646995484828949],["The DM should encourage the players to try different ideas when they encounter a problem.",0.6469771862030029],["As a summary, John presented his &quot;lessons learned&quot;: When trying to introduce change, look inward first.",0.6447293758392334],["When your team has conflicts over differences in personality or working style, here are some things you can try: Decide what you can and can't change \"He talks non-stop.\"",0.6434361934661865],["If you are having problems with your sound, the first thing you should do is try a different reed.",0.6402339935302734],["\"What John Michael is doing is passing on the stories, the songs and the history of his heritage.",0.6343330144882202],["When a player settles on a song unless you're Atlanta Brave John Rocker, who was asked by Twisted Sister to stop using \"I Wanna Rock\" after his offensive quotes surfaced in Sports Illustrated it usually becomes his fingerprint.",0.6332995891571045],["Warren: What you should do is change the easiest thing first and the things that make the greatest difference.",0.6326049566268921],["Changed PET Page template Published to release 3.1 Reviewer: T.

Night&#39s Dream Art Interpretations by Patrick D&#46&#44 Brisa C&#46&#44 Michael S&#46&#44 and Tina L&#46 Midsummer Night&#39s Dream by Partick &#44 Tina &#44 and Brisa The art form that we made is portraying the woods \nin which the faires live in Midsummer Night&#39s Dream&#46 It is also portraying the many things that we think are living in the forest and what they are doing in this magical forest&#46 One of the characters that we portray is Titania &#46 Our picture means Titania&#44 the Fairy Queen&#44 is always with her trains and always worshiped by her fairies&#46 We chose to make a drawing so that we could get many things into the one picture with lots of detail&#46 With this art form we were able to show many different things without it being confusing or hard to understand&#46 By using the colors it made the place look more lifelike by making it look like any other forest except with a couple of strange twists&#46 Midsummer Night&#39s Dream by Michael I chose to write a song as my art form because I like music and I am trying to learn how to play the piano&#46 I thought it would be a good idea if I tried to composing a piece on the piano&#46 I believe I came up with a musical composition that fits the tone of the book&#46 The song is portraying the story in a A Midsummer Night&#39s Dream&#46 The story surrounds a wedding with everyone happily bustling around preparing for the big event&#46 I wrote my song as a theme for A Midsummer Night&#39s Dream &#46 I first thought about the story and decided that the song should be lively&#44 but gentle&#46 I tried to work on different melodies and different combinations of notes until I finally came up with a melody that fit the tone of the story&#46 After I composed that melody&#44 a series of problems take place in the story&#44 which throw everything off track and cause confusion&#46 The King of the Fairies&#44 Oberon&#44 sends his messenger&#44 Puck or Robin Goodfellow&#44 to retrieve a magic flower&#44 whose juice&#44 when squeezed over the eyes&#44 causes a sleeping person to fall in love with the first person they see&#46 When his messenger tried to squeeze the juice over the eyes of Titania&#44 the Queen of Fairies&#44 and Demetrius&#44 he messes up and squeezes the juice over the wrong person&#39s eyes&#46 This event sets off a chain of mistaken love interests&#44 which causes chaos&#46 Everything works out in the end&#46 As I was writing this melody&#44 I initially wanted to convey the happiness of the scene when two people were getting married and everyone was happy&#46 In the first two lines I wanted to show a peaceful scene&#46 As the story and the music progresses&#44 the music becomes higher and livelier&#46 At the end of the song&#44 I wanted to finish the melody with the same notes to show that the story had come in a full circle&#46 LISTEN TO THIS&",0.6012248992919922],["It is also useful as a debugging tool when trying to determine what changed in a
