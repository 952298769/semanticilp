textbook Around 350 mya, some of these evolved into gymnosperms gymnosperms are plants that bear seeds, generally in cones but do not have flowers do not have fruit depend on the wind to blow their pollen around to fertilize another plant to produce seeds most have needle-like leaves generally have a single stem with minor branches, like a Christmas tree modern examples are pines and redwoods visualize the world covered by coniferous forests straight trunks, twiggy branches, needles difficult to move from one tree to the next, few arboreal animals not much to eat up in the trees, anyway this was the environment in which the dinosaurs first evolved, diversified, and became the most prevalent kind of animal around mammals also first appeared in this kind of environment, but they remained relatively few compared to the reptiles About 100 mya, during the Cretaceous period, a new type of plant emerged: the angiosperms this was the later part of the time that reptiles dominated the land angiosperms are plants that have flowers many of which depend on insects or animals to pick up pollen and redeposit it in order to fertilize the same flower or a different one to produce seeds produce seeds enclosed in fruits, rather than cones, many of which are edible many depend on animals to disperse the seeds have broad, rather than needle-like, leaves have complex branches, like most familiar trees most familiar modern plants are angiosperms, except conifers and ferns imagine the world largely covered by tropical and temperate deciduous forests like the ones in the pictures we have been seeing of primates angiosperms offered new kinds of food sources (fruits, flowers, and leaves), opening new ecological niches the angiosperms co-evolved with animals, developing showy flowers with edible nectar and fruits to attract animals to pollinate them and also using edible fruits to get animals to disperse their seeds many animals evolved specialized features to find, eat, and digest the angiosperm fruits and leaves for the first time, many animals also developed arboreal habits, since angiosperm forests form interlocking canopies, unlike conifers various mammals adapted to these new niches, including the precursors to the primates adapted to eat insects and possibly seeds similar to modern tree shrews imagine tropical deciduous forests, with dinosaurs prevalent on the ground, and little shrewlike mammals scurrying around in the trees and underbrush Something drastic happened at the end of the Cretaceous period, around 65 mya many species of animals and plants abruptly went extinct almost all of the dinosaurs disappeared most geologists and paleontologists now believe that this was due to the impact of a massive meteorite on the earth the dust and vapor thrown up by the impact darkened the globe for several years killing plants and plankton, temporarily cooling the climate, etc. disrupting the food chain and driving many species to extinction but some of the small, nocturnal, rodent-like early mammals survived these were our ancestors... by about 10 million years later, some of these little mammals had evolved into the first definite primates this was the Eocene epoch, about 55 to 34 mya the peak of recent global temperatures, about 25 C (77 F) Effectively the whole earth was tropical, hot, and wet most of the world was covered with tropical forest there were two varieties of primates, both similar to different kinds of modern prosimians adapids like modern lemurs larger longer snout smaller orbits (and therefore, eyes) thus probably diurnal frugivores and folivores one species had considerable sexual dimorphism suggesting male-male competition probably multi-male social groups omomyids like modern tarsiers smaller shorter snout larger eyes thus probably nocturnal frugivores, insectivores and gummivores the basic primate features emerged in this environment grasping hands and feet with opposable thumb/big toe nails, not claws, with grasping pads on fingers hindlimb-dominated locomotion reduced snout and sense of smell larger, forward-facing eyes with overlapping field of view this is
