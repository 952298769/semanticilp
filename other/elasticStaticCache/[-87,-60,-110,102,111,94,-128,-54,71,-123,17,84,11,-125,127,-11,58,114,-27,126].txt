supergiants can be seen at tremendous distances because of their great luminosity, they appear to be a very rare type of star Certainly, there are far more red-giant stars in our Galaxy than blue and

dwarf stars all possess Masses less than about 1.4 M sun Radii a few hundredths of Sun's (700,000 km) making them about size of Earth (7,000 km) Consequently, white dwarfs must have mean densities on order of millions of g/cm 3 Suggests white dwarfs composed of matter in state unlike anything we possess on Earth Bright Stars vs. Nearby Stars Stars that are among brightest in night sky are, in general, intrinsically brighter than Sun Most are giants or supergiants, about 70% Some are early-type stars on upper end of main sequence, about 30% Stars that are among closest to Solar System are, in general, intrinsically fainter than Sun - most telescopic Most are red dwarf stars, i.e., spectral class M stars Some are white dwarf stars Stars within about 15 ly of Solar System Number about 50 stars About 0.004 star/ly 3 Or, about 1.0 star/300 ly 3 For every 1000 small, red, class M stars, there are 350 class A to K main-sequence stars, and 1 class B or O main-sequence, giant, or supergiant
