To sprout from the ground and survive, seeds require water, air, and a specific temperature. Seeds can get water, oxygen, and sun by being placed at the proper planting depth. Planting depth is the depth at which a seed is placed in the soil. If a seed is exposed to these vital needs, it goes through a process called germination.
