genetic duplicates of the mother plant Preserves desirable characteristics (high yield, fast growth) which could be lost in sexual reproduction Often more labor intensive and expensive Propagation by seed Seed labels (not required) Hard seed - requires scarification Fungicidal coating - pink or purple seed Primed seed KCl or ethyl alcohol treatment triggers plant growth hormones, seeds germinate sooner less chance of disease problems (plants become more disease resistant a few days after germination) Seed quality Seed viability- high germination rate Buy seed tested for current growing season Buy hybrid varieties for vigor Home seed production Self-pollinated varieties are easiest Cross-pollinated varieties require controlled pollinations F 1 hybrid plants should not be used segregation in F 2 generation results in plants with variable traits Seed harvesting Desire mature embryos Collect mature seed from ripe fruit prior to seed dispersal Seed must be extracted from surrounding fruit tissue &amp; dried Woody plants with hard seed coats - harvest seed when not fully mature - can be sown directly without scarification Seed storage Store in a cool, dry place (sealed container in refrigerator) Life of seed doubles for each 10 drop in temperature slows respiration Life of seed doubles for each 10% decrease in seed moisture dessicants - silica gel treated with CoCl 2 Longer seed are stored, fewer seed will germinate Seed can be stored as low as 0 F (-18 C) 40 F (refrigerator) best for most home uses of seed Growing plants from seed Direct seeding - growing seed outdoors Site selection is important light, drainage, soil fertility Timing of planting important - cold tolerance Cool season crops - 40-55 F soil temp.",0.974231481552124]]
