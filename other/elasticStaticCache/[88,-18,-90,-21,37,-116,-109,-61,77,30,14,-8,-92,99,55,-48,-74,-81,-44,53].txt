protection of sea otters/macro invertebrates different jurisdictional authorities need to be identified, Sanctuary needs to have influence Sanctuary should be coordinating agency for other authorities

vessels education/outreach should be a top priority: more resources and activities, focus on primary schools, expand programs outside of Santa Barbara, teacher workshops, develop this at early age, provide more direct interaction with the marine resources, interpretive enforcement (backed up by law enforcement) investigate our use of terms such as &quot;resources&quot;, &quot;no-take zones&quot; take resource management out of the hands of the Dept. of Commerce laws should be made adequate enough to protect the resources limited entry for divers no-take zones with limited access demonize certain activities, no-take zones should be absolute, that don t let anyone in except for navigation visitor use should be limited and appropriate such as the use of sea caves where there are nesting seabirds (Top of Page) Long Beach concerned about protecting sea otters opposed to oil and gas development in the channel concerned about funding - adequate financial resources to carry out mission concerned about impacts from recreational boaters, more education needed yacht clubs need to address habitat enhancement for endangered species - should be a priority over human use need to address the threat that non-native species pose to endangered species need to take a look at maximum enforcement of regulations need a comprehensive and complete management plan with research areas - no-take zones and ground truth areas for sampling need to be strong about what is allowable and what is not the management should address terrestrial impacts on the Sanctuary - the relationship between human activities in the island watersheds and the effect on the intertidal enforcement should allow for more than paper protection (need citations, fines, etc.) concerned about aquaria collectors taking too

the fishery Sanctuary should take into account and be prepared for significant increase in military activity Sanctuary needs increase in protection from radar activity and not plan as if the miliary

education opportunities for the public Navy stated that they would be willing to share information on marine mammals, air quality, etc. with the Sanctuary to use in their EIS interest in authorities and priorities - very confusing: outreach problem - public needs to be educated, need information in a sound bit expand Sanctuary boundaries - include coast, make as big as possible, more needs to be protected, address coastal water quality issues, boundaries are too arbitrary and don't address threats outside boundaries otters will cause more conflict with people who rely on the resources, CINMS should be prepared (Top of Page) Washington, D.C. need to spell and formalize (including relationships with other agencies) the process for the management plan and marine reserves marine reserve issue needs to fundamentally be part of the management plan need to realize impact of extractive activities on the decline of the marine resources (rock fish, giant sea bass, etc) support for exploring various issues within the issues of boundary expansion - tie to rationale - water quality, oil & gas, critical in EIS to state how boundary expansion will address these other issues issue of funding and resources if boundary expand, need to develop budget to support implementing new management plan will require more resources if you do reach out to the nearshore, suggest you include impacts/events in programs need to consider runoff from Channel Islands due to erosion first priority for management plan should be emphasis on activities within current boundaries and why marine reserves are a critical issue need to consider dynamics of sea otters as functional part of original community in Channel Islands and the roll of CINMS in re-establishing populations (Top of Page) San
