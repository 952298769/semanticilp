natural selection environment determines which individuals are most successful and will reproduce Artificial selection goes on all the time Nature selects for or against traits Populations change with time Changes in population are shaped by natural selection over time a population changes to the point that it is a different species Definitions Population=individuals of the same species in a defined area Species=actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations (production of viable offspring) Evolution=genetic changes with time Populations evolve, individuals do not Individual's genetic composition is set at conception Genes, located on chromosomes code for various traits Genes exist in two or more forms called alleles Genotype=genetic makeup Phenotype=physical appearance Variability (or genetic diversity) is critical Problems with lack of variabiliy (disease can wipe out populations without enough variable resistance) Variability can be effected by factors that produce new alleles mutations-occur randomly-some good-most bad-may be selected for or against resuffling of existing alleles recombination offspring differ from parents through random recombination of alleles random combinations may make individuals more or less fit (or have no effect) increases variability genetic drift separation of populations smaller group=less \nvariability interbreeding

at different times organisms from the past are different than those today fossils found close to each other are similar (those distant from each other are more different) sometimes intermediate forms are found generally, older rocks have more simple fossils than more recent Evidence from Comparative Anatomy natural selection can only use existing structures and gradually modify them homologous structures-related structures in related organisms e.g. forelimbs of mammals same bones exist but forms change man to bat to whale vestigal organs-basic organs with no apparent use in the current form, but string resemblance to ancestral forms humans retain vertebrae that wiggle tails whales retain hipbones Evidence from Embryology embryos of many organisms are very similar human embryos pass

gradually producing new species Divergent evolution single populations split and differences gradually accumulate Adaptive radiation simultaneous divergent evolution Convergent evolution dissimilar or distantly related organisms begin to look alike (whales and porpoises look like fish) Rates of Evolution Phyletic gradualism divided populations change at about the same gradual rate Punctuated
