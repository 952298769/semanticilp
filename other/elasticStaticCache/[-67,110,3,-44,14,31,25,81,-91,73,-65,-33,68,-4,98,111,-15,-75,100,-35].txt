A clear light will thus also be thrown on the fact that flowers are invariably constructed so as to permit, or favour, or necessitate the union of two individuals. We shall clearly understand why monœcious and diœcious,—why dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist, and many other such cases. The plan which I have followed in my experiments is to grow plants in the same pot, or in pots of the same size, or close together in the open ground; to carefully exclude insects; and then to fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the same flower, and others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct but adjoining plant. In many, but not all, of these experiments, the crossed plants yielded much more seed than the self-fertilised plants; and I have never seen the {128}reversed case. The self-fertilised and crossed seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on damp sand; and as the seeds successively germinated, they were planted in pairs on opposite sides of the same pot, with a superficial partition between them, and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light. In other cases the self-fertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on opposite sides of the same small pot. I have, in short, followed different plans, but in every case have taken all the precautions which I could think of, so that the two lots should be equally favoured. Now, I have carefully observed the growth of plants raised from crossed and self-fertilised seed, from their germination to maturity, in species of the following genera, namely, Brassica, Lathyrus, Lupinus, Lobelia, Lactuca, Dianthus, Myosotis, Petunia, Linaria, Calceolaria, Mimulus, and Ipomœa, and the difference in their powers of growth, and of withstanding in certain cases unfavourable conditions, was most manifest and strongly marked. It is of importance that the two lots of seed should be sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot, so that the seedlings may struggle against each other; for if sown separately in ample and good soil, there is often but little difference in their growth.",1.1265743970870972],["Controls in our example would include: the origin of the seeds (they must all come from the same package and should be randomly selected), the amounts of light and water each plant receives, the type of soil used (same type, brand, etc.), the size of the pot, and the temperature.",1.1118817329406738],["Apparatus : thirty-two plant seeds eight pots and soil in which to plant seeds Procedure : Prepare pots with soil and water.",1.1026197671890259],["Apparatus : thirty-two plant seeds eight pots and soil in which to plant seeds Procedure : Prepare pots with soil and water.",1.1026197671890259],["To my mind, it is quite simple really - embryos must be alive or else a baby would never develop.

Poor pot two never gets any water. After two weeks, a plant grows in pots one and two, but noting comes from pot three.

The seeds were cleaned, mixed well, and stored in paper bags in the dark at laboratory temperature. In early May 2008, the plastic pots (35 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) were filled with loam soil obtained from Hezuo station (the nutrient element contents of soil C: 0.68 ± 0.08 g/kg; N:0.27 ± 0.04 g/kg; P:0.66 ± 0.14 g/kg; PH: 6.27 ± 0.27). Each pot included 60 seeds that were buried into a depth of 1 cm. Given that L. virgaurea begins clonal growth in the second growing season (Wang et al. 2008 ), each pot had ≤5 plants (low density, ≈15/m2) and ≥35 plants (high density, ≈100/m2) at each light treatment at the beginning of the second growing season (in mid-May 2009). The densities treatment depended on the investigation of the natural population (low density, 18.33 ± 8.17/m2; high density, 75.44 ± 26.48/m2). Each treatment contained 40 pots, and they were arranged randomly at the same light condition. Pots were hand-weeded and hand-watered every year, and no fertilizer was applied throughout four growing seasons (from 2008 to 2011).
