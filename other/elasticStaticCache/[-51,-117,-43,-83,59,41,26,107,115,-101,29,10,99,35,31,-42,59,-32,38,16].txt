This provides for backwards compatibility with existing browsers and allows authors to specify alternative media via nested OBJECT elements. Note that this doesn't provide the same level of flexibility as would be provided by a richer description of resource variants. For instance, several media types are available for resources, each in English, Spanish, French, and German. In general, all \nattribute names and values in this specification are case insensitive, except where noted otherwise. OBJECT has the following attributes: ID Used to define a document-wide identifier. This can be used for naming positions within documents for use as destinations of hypertext links. An ID attribute value is an SGML NAME token. NAME tokens are formed by an initial letter followed by letters in the range a-z and A-Z (no accented characters), digits, -, and . characters. It may also be used by the user agent or objects in the document to find and communicate with other objects embedded in the document. DECLARE Used to indicate that the object is to be declared but not instantiated. A detailed description of the DECLARE attribute is given below. CLASSID This is a URL that identifies an implementation for the object. In some object systems, this is a class identifier. CODEBASE Some URL schemes used to identify implementations require an additional URL to find the implementation. CODEBASE allows you to specify that URL. DATA This is a URL pointing to the object's data--for instance, a GIF file for an image. In the absence of the CLASSID attribute, the media type of the data is used to determine a default value for the CLASSID attribute. The implementation is then loaded as if the CLASSID attribute had been given explicitly. TYPE This specifies the Internet Media Type [7] for the data referenced by the DATA attribute in advance of actually retrieving it. In the absence of the CLASSID attribute, this allows the user agent to retrieve the code implementing the object concurrently with the data and to skip over unsupported media types without needing to make a network access. CODETYPE This specifies the Internet Media Type [7] of the code referenced by the CLASSID attribute in advance of actually retrieving it. User agents may use the value of the CODETYPE attribute to skip over unsupported media types without needing to make a network access. STANDBY This allows you to specify a short text string the browser can show while loading the object's implementation and data. It can include character entities for accented characters, etc. ALIGN This determines where to place the object. The ALIGN attribute allows objects to be placed as part of the current text line or as a distinct unit, aligned to the left, center, or right. The following values are chosen for their ease of implementation and their independence from other graphics occurring earlier on the same line: For ALIGN=TEXTTOP , the top of the object is vertically aligned with the top of the current font. For ALIGN=MIDDLE , the middle of the object is vertically aligned with the baseline. For ALIGN=TEXTMIDDLE , the middle of the object is vertically aligned with the position midway between the baseline and the x-height for the current font. The x-height is defined as the top of a lowercase x in western writing systems. If the text font is an all caps style, then use the height of a capital X. For other writing systems, align the middle of the object with the middle of the text. For ALIGN=BASELINE , the bottom of the object is vertically aligned with the baseline of the text line in which the object appears. For ALIGN=TEXTBOTTOM , the bottom of the object is vertically aligned with the bottom of the current font. Note The proposed Netscape extensions for the align attribute of the IMG element are context sensitive, as are some of the implementations of ALIGN=TOP. See the test page at http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Test/Img/imgtest.html. The following alignment values allow the object to float rather than being treated as part of the current line: For ALIGN=LEFT , the object is floated down and over to the current left margin. Subsequent text is flowed past the right hand side of the visible area of the object. For ALIGN=CENTER , the object is floated to after the end of the current line and centered between the left and right margins. Subsequent text starts at the beginning of the next line. For ALIGN=RIGHT , the object is floated down and over to the current right margin. Subsequent text is flowed past the left hand side of the visible area of the object. WIDTH This gives the suggested width of a box enclosing the visible area of the object. The width is specified in standard units. User agents may use this value to scale an object to match the requested width if appropriate. Note Smooth scaling a small image to a larger size provides an effective solution to reducing the time needed to download an image, offering better subjective results when compared to color reduction. HEIGHT This gives the suggested height of a box enclosing the visible area of the object. The height is specified in standard units. User agents may use this value to scale an object to match the requested height if appropriate. BORDER This attribute applies to the border shown when the object forms part of a hypertext link, as specified by an enclosing anchor element. The attribute specifies the suggested width of this border around the visible area of the object. The width is specified in \"#units\". HSPACE The suggested width of the space to the left and right of the box enclosing the visible area of the object. The width is specified in standard units. This attribute is used to alter the separation of preceding and following text from the object. VSPACE The suggested height of the space to the top and bottom of the box enclosing the visible area of the object. The height is specified in standard units. USEMAP This specifies a uniform resource locator for a client-side image map [4] in the format proposed by Spyglass, Inc. This is normally appropriate only for static images. SHAPES The presence of this attribute indicates that the contents of the OBJECT element contains anchors with hypertext links associated with shaped regions \non the visible area of the object. See below for further information. NAME This provides a way for user agents that support FORMs to determine whether an object within a FORM block should participate in the \"submit\" process. If NAME is specified and the DECLARE attribute is absent, then the user agent should include the value of the NAME attribute and data obtained from the object along with the information derived from other form fields. The mechanism used to obtain the object's data is specific to each object system. Note As class identifiers in some object systems can be quite cumbersome, the CLASSID attribute may use a short URL to specify a class identifier indirectly. See the Internet Draft on Hypertext Link Relationships in HTML [3] for details on the \"pointer\" link relationship. More About OBJECT DECLARE OBJECT markup with the DECLARE attribute imply objects that are not created (instantiated) until needed by something that references them (i.e., late binding). Each such \"binding\" typically results in a separate copy of the object (this is class dependent). In other words, the OBJECT DECLARE is treated as a declaration for making an instance of an object. If the declared object isn't supported, or fails to load, the user agent should try the content of the OBJECT DECLARE element, which is currently restricted to another OBJECT DECLARE element. The TYPE attribute can be used to specify the Internet Media Type for the object as a hint for this situation. Examples of OBJECT DECLARE Usage To allow PARAM values to be \"object valued\"; that is, the value of the parameter is a pointer to an object. See Example 2 in the section entitled \"PARAM Element\" that follows. To allow hypertext links to point to objects that can't otherwise be addressed using a single URL. For instance: &lt;OBJECT ID=\"obj1\" DECLARE CLASSID=implementation &gt; &lt;PARAM NAME=param1 VALUE=value1&gt; &lt;PARAM NAME=param2 VALUE=value2&gt; &lt;/OBJECT&gt; &lt;P&gt;This points to an &lt;A HREF= \"#obj1\"&gt;object&lt;/A&gt;. The meaning of the link in the anchor HREF=\"#obj1\" depends on what it points to. In this case it points to an object declaration that is then used to replace the current page with a new instance of the specified object class and data. If the HREF points to an HTML element like &lt;H1&gt; or &lt;P&gt; or &lt;A&gt;, then the browser scrolls the document to that point. Note Anchors can exploit nested declared objects to provide alternative media for a given resource. The PARAM Element The PARAM element, shown in Example 2 , allows a list of named property values (used, for example, to &lt;!ELEMENT param - O EMPTY -- named property value --&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST param name CDATA #REQUIRED -- property name -- value CDATA #IMPLIED -- property value -- valuetype (DATA|REF|OBJECT) DATA -- How to interpret value -- type CDATA #IMPLIED -- Internet media type -- &gt; initialize an ActiveX control, plug-in module, or Java applet) to be represented as a sequence of PARAM elements. Note that PARAM is an empty element and should appear without an end tag. The NAME attribute defines the property name. The case sensitivity of the name is dependent on the code implementing the object. The VALUE attribute is used to specify the property value. It is an opaque character string whose meaning is determined by the object based on the property name. Note that CDATA attribute values need characters such as &amp; to be escaped using the standard SGML character entities, e.g., &amp;amp; for &amp;. It is also essential to escape the &gt; character to defend against incorrect handling by many existing browsers (use &amp;gt;). The VALUETYPE attribute can be one of REF, OBJECT, or DATA as described below: REF Indicates that the value is a URL. This allows support tools to identify URLs given as parameters. The value should be passed as is after dealing with any embedded character or numeric character entities; i.e., the URL should not be canonicalized before being passed to the OBJECT. OBJECT Indicates that the value is a URL of an OBJECT element in the same document. This is used primarily for object valued properties (where the value of a property is a pointer/reference to a running object). DATA Indicates that the value is to be passed directly to the object as a string, after dealing with any embedded character or numeric character entities. This is the default in the absence of an explicit value for VALUETYPE. Note that the valuetype attribute value can be given without the corresponding attribute name, as seen in the examples below. This exploits a feature of SGML minimization. The TYPE attribute is only valid for VALUETYPE=REF. In Example 3 , the string \"Hello World!\" is passed to the object as the value for the \"Caption\" property. Example 4 is a hypothetical example of an applet for viewing poems. The poem is passed to the viewer applet via the DATA attribute. The applet recognizes a parameter named \"font\" that defines the font as an object. The VALUE attribute uses a URL fragment identifier #tribune to point to the font object, which is itself defined with an OBJECT DECLARE element. &lt;PARAM NAME=\"Caption\" VALUE=\"Hello World!\"&gt; is equivalent to &lt;PARAM NAME=\"Caption\" DATA VALUE=\"Hello World!\"&gt; &lt;OBJECT DECLARE ID=tribune TYPE=\"application/x-webfont\" DATA=tribune.gif&gt; &lt;/OBJECT&gt; &lt;OBJECT CLASSID=\"http:// ...\" DATA=\"KublaKhan.txt\"&gt; &lt;PARAM NAME=font OBJECT VALUE=\"#tribune\"&gt; &lt;P&gt;You're missing a really cool poem viewer ... &lt;/OBJECT&gt; In the following example, the \"Source\" property of the object is passed the URL images/foo.gif. &lt;PARAM NAME=\"Source\" REF VALUE=images/foo.gif&gt; Client-Side Image Maps Image maps allow hypertext links to be associated with shaped regions on an image. The following mechanism extends the anchor element and provides backwards compatibility \nwith all existing browsers. It removes the need to duplicate image maps with textual hypertext menus for non-graphical browsers. Figure 1 is a navigation toolbar, which is represented as shown in Example 5 . On all HTML 2.0 browsers Example 5 would look like: Access Guide | Go | Search | Top 10 The SHAPE and COORDS Attributes If the OBJECT element includes a SHAPES attribute, then user agents need to parse the contents of the element to look for anchors. The anchor element (&lt;a href=...&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;) is extended to permit a pair of new attributes SHAPE and COORDS. These attributes associate the hypertext link with a region on the image specified by the enclosing OBJECT element. The SHAPE and COORDS attributes take one of the general forms: shape=default shape=rect coords= \"left-x, top-y , right-x , bottom-y \" shape=circle coords= \"center-x, center-y , radius \" shape=poly coords= \"x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3,...\" Where x and y are measured in pixels from the left/top of the associated image. If x and y values are given with a percent sign (%) as a suffix, the values should be interpreted as percentages of the image's width and height, respectively. For example: SHAPE=RECT COORDS=\"0, 0, 50%, 100%\" The ISMAP Attribute When present with SHAPE and COORDS attributes, the ISMAP attribute causes the location clicked to be passed to the server. The user agent derives a new URL from the URL specified by the HREF attribute &lt;object data=\"navbar.gif\" shapes&gt; &lt;a href=guide.html shape=rect coords=\"0,0,118,28\"&gt;Access Guide&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=shortcut.html shape=rect coords=\"118,0,184,28\"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=search.html shape=rect coords=\"184,0,276,28\"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=top10.html shape=rect coords=\"276,0,373,28\"&gt;Top Ten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/object&gt; by appending ?, the x coordinate, and the y coordinate of the location in pixels. The link is then followed using the new URL. For instance, if the user clicked at the location (10,27) for a link with: HREF=\"http://www.acme.com/Guide/top10.html\" then the derived URL will be: http://www.acm e.com/Guide/top10.html?10,27 The use of ISMAP for selected regions allows authors to exploit client-side and server-side imagemaps for the same image, e.g., regions that visually act as 3D beveled buttons can be handled locally, while for complex image maps, or where it is undesirable to pass the imagemap to the client, the location clicked can be dealt with by the server. An example can be seen in \"Find the ball\" competitions where sending the imagemap to the client would give the competition away. The DTD Extensions for Anchors The formal SGML definition of the ISMAP, SHAPE, and COORDS attributes is: &lt;!ATTLIST A ... shape (default|rect|circle|poly) #IMPLIED coords CDATA #IMPLIED ismap (ismap) #IMPLIE &gt; The visually impaired community have argued strongly in favor of the shaped anchor mechanism, as it forces authors to provide a way for readers to follow the links regardless of which browser they are using. Defining Overlapping Regions In Figure 2 , the rectangles are mapped to different URLs. Although the rectangles overlap, clicking on each rectangle loads the appropriate document. If two or more regions overlap, the region defined first in the map definition takes precedence over other regions. &lt;object data=\"navbar1.gif\" usemap=\"#map1\"&gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;map name=\"map1\"&gt; &lt;area href=guide.html alt=\"Access Guide\" shape=rect coords=\"0,0,118,28\"&gt; &lt;area href=search.html alt=\"Search\" shape=rect coords=\"184,0,276,28\"&gt; &lt;area href=shortcut.html alt=\"Go\" shape=rect coords=\"118,0,184,28\"&gt; &lt;area href=top10.html alt=\"Top Ten\" shape=rect coords=\"276,0,373,28\"&gt; &lt;/map&gt; For example, in the map definition for Figure 2 , the leftmost rectangle is defined before the rightmost rectangle: &lt;object data=\"overlap.gif\" shapes&gt; &lt;a href=green.html shape=rect coords=\"66,13,186,37\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=blue.html shape=rect coords=\"195,43,245,46\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/object&gt; In all cases shape=default has the lowest precedence. It extends to the whole of the visible region of the object. Anchors can use the SHAPE attribute together with the TARGET attribute for designating the target user interface object (e.g., frame) for displaying the linked document or resource. The MAP Element The MAP element provides an alternative mechanism for client-side image maps. It was developed by Spyglass for use with the IMG element [4]. The SHAPE and COORDS attributes are the same as for the shaped anchor mechanism. The navigational toolbar becomes Example 6 . The OBJECT element references the MAP with a URL given with the USEMAP attribute. The SHAPE and COORDS attributes behave in the same way as for the shaped anchor proposal. The ALT attribute can be used to provide a few words describing each choice. This can't include markup but can include character entities. Note that MAP isn't backwards compatible with HTML 2.0 browsers. HTML OBJECTs DTD The DTD or Document Type Definition ( Example 7 ) provides the formal definition of the allowed syntax for HTML objects. n &lt;!-- Content model entities imported from parent DTD:
