The spatial variation in the consequences of physical processes across Earths surface Therefore, the student is able to: A. Describe how physical processes affect different regions on the United States and the world, as exemplified by being able to Explain how extreme physical events effect human settlements in different regions (e.g., the destructive effects of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin and the eastern United States or of earthquakes in Turkey, Japan, and Nicaragua) Use maps to illustrate how such natural disasters as floods and hurricanes can alter landscapes (e.g., the impact of the Mississippi River floods of the summer of 1993 on the structure of the river valley in Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri or the changes along the Florida coast caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992) Describe the physical processes that occur in dry environments (e.g., desertification and soil degradation, flash floods, dust storms, sand movement, soil erosion, salt accumulation) B. Explain Earths physical processes, patterns, and cycles using concepts of physical geography, as exemplified by being able to Explain the distribution of different types of climate (e.g., marine climate or continental climate) that is produced by such processes as air-mass circulation, temperature, and moisture Describe the physical processes (e.g., erosion, folding and faulting, volcanism) that produce distictive landforms (e.g., specific types of mountains, such as buttes and mesas, block mountains or horsts, ridge-and-valley sytstems) Explain the effects of different physical cycles (e.g., world atmospheric circulation, ocean circulation) on the physical environment of Earth C. Explain the various interactions resulting from Earth-Sun relationships, as exemplified by being able to Describe the effects of the tilt of the Earths axis on the cycle of the seasons in the \nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres Explain the difference between solstices and equinoxes and the reasons why they occur Speculate on various possible scenarios of future world climates should there be an increase in the greenhouse effect D. Describe the ways in which Earths physical processes are dynamic and interactive, as exemplififed by being able to Explain why the features ot the ocean floor are evidence of the dynamioc forces that shape continents and ocean basins Explain the relationships between changes in landforms and the effects of climate (e.g., the erosion of hill slopes by precipitation, deposition of sediments by floods, shaping of land surfaces by wind) Identify the conditions that cause changes in climate and the consequent effects on ocean levels, agricultural productivity, and population distribution Geography Standard 8: The characteristics and spatial distribution of ecosystems on earths surface By the end of the twelfth grade, the student knows and understands: The distribution and characteristics of ecosystems The biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems The importance of ecosystems in peoples understanding of environmental issues Therefore, the student is able to: A. Analyze the distrbibution of ecosystems by interpreting relationships between soil, climate, and plant and animal life, as exemplified by being able to Analyze the nature of plant communities in an area in terms of solar energy and water supply Describe how physical characteristics such as climate and soil affect the number, kinds, and distribution of plants and animals in an ecosystem Describe the factors and processes involved in the formation of soils in different ecosystems (e.g., climate type, parent-rock materials, slope of land, effects of human activities) B. Evaluate ecosystems in terms of their biodiversity and productivity, as exemplified by being able to Use knowledge of the cariable productivity of different ecosystems to develop a set of general statements about the nature of such systems Characterize ecosystems by their level of biodiversity and productivity (e.g., the low productivity of deserts and the high productivity of mid-latitude forests and tropical forests) and describe their potential value to all living things (e.g., as a source of oxygen for life forms, as a source of food for indigenous peoples, as a source of raw materials for international trade) Evaluate the carrying capacity of different ecosystems in relation to land-use policies (e.g., the optimal number of cattle per square mile in a grassland) C. Apply the concept of ecosystems to understand and solve problems regarding environmental issues, as exemplified by being able to Describe the effects of biological magnification on ecosystems (e.g., the increase in contaminants in succeeding levels of the food chain and the consequences for different life-forms) Describe the effects of both physical and human changes on ecosystems (e.g., the disruption of energy flows and chemical cycles and the reduction of species diversity) Evaluate the long-term effects of the human modification of ecosystems (e.g., how acid rain resulting from air pollution affects water bodies and forests and how depletion of the atmospheres ozone layer through the use of chemicals may affect the health of humans) TOP",1.0287797451019287],["X1011783140-00147-34536</DOCNO> Quia - List of Terms List of Terms Geography World - Ecosystems / Biomes terms related to the world's living ecosystems and biomes A B ecosystem an environment, its living and nonliving elements, and how they work together vegetation plant life soil mixture of rock particles and decayed plant material succession changes in the plantlife of an ecosystem climax vegetation the final stage of succession needleleaf forest trees which keep their leaves year round broadleaf forest trees lose their wide leaves each fall rain forest wide leafed evergreen trees savanna tall grassland with some trees prairie tall and medium grasslands steppe short grassland adapt plants and animals change to survive desert ecosystem found in arid climates oasis place in a desert with fresh water acid rain pollution mixes with rain water greenhouse effect leads to global warming ozone layer protects us from UV radiation overfishing damages oceanic ecosystems irrigation can reduce groundwater and add salt to soil hibernation one way animals adapt to climate",1.0279117822647095],["The cloud forest flora was so different from the arid-adapted plants of the interandean valley and so similar to the plants of the rain forest, that at times it was difficult to remember that we were not more than a few miles from Quito.",1.0277005434036255],["Learn more about the different reptiles families that live in the rain forest.",1.023643970489502],["Nicole If I could make a difference I would clean up the parks and forests in my city, and plant trees to make the area more beautiful.",1.0233538150787354],["Forests must be managed so that plant and animal species which exist naturally in the forest ecosystems, can survive under natural conditions and in vigorous populations.",1.0228568315505981],["Forests must be managed so that plant and animal species which exist naturally in the forest ecosystems can survive under natural conditions and in viable populations.",1.0228568315505981],["Forests must be managed so that plant and animal species which exist naturally in the forest ecosystems can survive under natural conditions and in viable populations.",1.0228568315505981],["Forests must be managed so that plant and animal species, which exist naturally in the forest ecosystems, can survive under natural conditions and in vigorous populations.",1.0228568315505981],["Monkey Rain Forest: identifies a number of rain forest plants and animals and reveals animals living at various levels-from the ground to the treetops.",1.0224374532699585],["It is in these heavily farmed and urbanized regions that forested stream corridors, even though they may be more constricted than many of their riparian counterparts in eastern Ohio, achieve their highest levels of importance as habitat for those species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and other plants and animals which are dependent on forested habitats for their survival.",1.0203038454055786],["The \nprogram contrasts two extremes, the desert habitat, where water is very scarce, and the tropical rain forest, where water is plentiful, to show that plants have different adaptations to help them survive in different areas.",1.0199190378189087],["Another factor was overexploitation of the rain-forest ecosystem, on which the Maya depended for food.",1.0170029401779175],["Another factor was overexploitation of the rain-forest ecosystem, on which the Maya depended for food.",1.0170029401779175],["It's different from a tropical rain forest Many unique plants and animals live there It's the only rain forest in the continental United States...
