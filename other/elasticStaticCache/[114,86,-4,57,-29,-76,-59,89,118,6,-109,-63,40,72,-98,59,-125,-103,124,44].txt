[["Sunlight can penetrate only through the upper levels of the ocean. Although the limit of visibility in the ocean is typically only about 100 feet, animals like the bottlenose which live in these lighted upper levels need to be camouflaged so as not to be seen easily by their predators. Just below these lighted upper levels the ocean provides a dark environment in which vision is often very limited. The dolphin must rely on other methods to “see” in its environment in order to hunt, avoid predators, communicate, and navigate.",1.4781463146209717]]
