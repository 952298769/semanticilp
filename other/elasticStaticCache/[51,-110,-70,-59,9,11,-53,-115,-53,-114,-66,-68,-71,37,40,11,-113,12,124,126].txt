Most biologists now identify six kingdoms Four kingdoms are eukaryotic Animalia and Plantae are mostly multicellular Fungi contain multicellular forms and single-celled yeasts Fundamental differences among multicellular kingdoms Different morphology, motility and nutrition Each kingdom evolved from different single-celled ancestor Protists are unicellular Arbitrary grouping Include algae Archaebacteria and Eubacteria contain prokaryotic organisms The Evolution of Prokaryotes Most fundamental differences not between plants and animals, but between prokaryotes and eukaryotes Prokaryotes though to be uniform group lacking membrane-bound nucleus Molecular DNA analysis Shows distinction between Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Indicates first eukaryotes evolved from Archaebacteria fig 29.4 Later forms acquired mitochondria in form of symbiotic Eubacteria Similar acquisition of chloroplasts Evolution of Eukaryotes Only bacteria existed on earth for 2 billion years First appeared 1.5 billion years ago Fungi, plants and animals are well-defined evolutionary groups Each stems from different single-celled ancestor Largely multicellular, derived from ancestor classified as Protista Greater metabolic diversity between two prokaryotic groups than among all eukaryotic groups Unicellular eukaryotes lumped together in Protista, lacking rationale to put them with fungi, plants or animals Characteristics of the six kingdoms tbl 29.2 Origins Almost all modern eukaryotes possess mitochondria derived from purple sulfur bacteria Some protists acquired chloroplasts and are photosynthetic Chloroplasts derived from symbiotic cyanobacteria Defining characteristic of groups that possess them Endosymbionts evolved and adjusted to new environment Lost redundant genes, kept only those needed for survival in cell Both contain own ribosomes, more similar to bacterial ribosomes Manufacture own membranes Divide independently of cell Contain chromosomes similar to those found in bacteria Other symbionts: basal bodies, centrioles, flagella, cilia Multicellularity Bacteria occur in nearly every habitat Protists diverse in form and biochemistry fig 29.5 Multicellularity allows novel adaptations to environment Distinct cell differentiation possible Greater complexity of activities True multicellularity Occurs only in eukaryotes Coordinates activities of individual cells Bacteria and some protists may form colonial aggregates Some protists exhibit simple multicellularity fig 29.6 Green algal protists were ancestors of plants Fungi and animals arose from unicellular ancestors Groups giving rise to these kingdoms still exist Sexuality Major characteristic of eukaryotes Process is regular, results are predictable Alternation between syngamy and meiosis Syngamy: produces cell with two sets of chromosomes Meiosis: produces cells with one set of chromosomes Differs greatly from genetic exchange in bacteria Cells of animals and plants are diploid during some part of life cycle Few eukaryotes complete life cycle in haploid condition Offspring of sexual eukaryotic organisms vary widely Due to segregation during meiosis Resulting from crossing over in meiosis Provides raw material for evolution Sexual organisms evolve rapidly in relation to demands of environment Protist sexual reproduction May only occur in times of stress Many are haploid throughout entire life, an ancestral condition Life cycles fig 29.7 Zygotic meiosis Zygote is the only diploid cell Zygote immediately undergoes meiosis All other stages are haploid Gametic meiosis Gametes are only haploid cell Gametes fuse giving rise to a zygote Sporic meiosis: alternation of generation Exhibited by plants Multicellular diploid form undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores Spores give rise to haploid phase Haploid form produces haploid gametes Gametes fuse to produce diploid zygote Viruses: A Special Case Viruses not classified as living organisms Viruses not included

Bacteria Are a Unique Group of Living Organisms Represent the oldest form of life fig 4.11 Only representatives of the prokaryotes Used to be classified as the only member of the kingdom Monera Present classification identifies two kingdoms of bacteria Archaebacteria Eubacteria Bacteria Are an Extremely Diverse Group of Organisms fig 30.11 Few major structural differences Species differentiation based on metabolic processes Characterized by growth on certain defined media Activities altered by growth conditions and chemicals Role of Bacteria Responsible for creating properties of atmosphere and soils Are autotrophic, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic, contribute to world carbon balance Are heterotrophic and break down organic compounds Only a few genera of bacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen Involved in industrial processes and chemical syntheses Produce acetic acid, vinegar, amino acids, enzymes Production of various milk products, bread and ethanol

Chromosomes: non-membrane bound DNA is circular and lacks proteins Cell division and genetic recombination Simple division via binary fission True sexual reproduction absent, genetic recombination irregular Internal compartmentalization: Lack membrane-bound organelles Enzymes are bound to cell membrane Only organelles present are ribosomes Flagella: possess simple flagella fig 30.1a,c,13 Composed of single flagellin fiber Lack 9 + 2 structure of eukaryotic flagella and cilia fig 5.26 Flagellar motion resembles spinning propeller, not whip-like motion Metabolic Diversity: Eukaryotes

bacteria will have mutant characteristics fig 30.16 Many mutants result from great number of individual cells Rapid multiplication in short time period Increase number with favorable mutations Rapidly changes characteristics of a population Plays important role in genetic diversity Example: development of antibiotic resistance Genetic Recombination Transfer of genes via viruses, plasmids, other DNA fragments Examples Rapid transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids Transfer of pathogenic characteristics among enteric bacteria Rapid generation time is an alternative evolutionary strategy BACTERIA AS PLANT PATHOGENS Cause Costly Plant Diseases Symptoms are generally spots on stems, leaves or fruit Include blights, soft rots and wilts Most pathogens are rod-shaped pseudomonads fig 30.11a Example: Citrus Canker Caused by pseudomonad Xanthomonas campestris Introduced from abroad, causes serious economical damage in Florida BACTERIA AS HUMAN PATHOGENS Cause Many Human Diseases tbl 30.1 Examples: cholera, leprosy, tetanus, bacterial pneumonia, whooping cough, diphtheria Generally related to one of several genera Streptococcus: pneumonia, scarlet and rheumatic fevers fig 30.1b

many species of bacteria High sugar diets harmful Bacteria convert sugars to lactic acid Acid destroys hard tissue of tooth Control via fluoride by retarding loss of calcium Sexually Transmitted Diseases STDs caused by bacteria and viruses Viral STDs have no cure Bacterial STDs \nfrequently mutate to drug-resistant strains Gonorrhea Most prevalent communicable disease, cause by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium Transmitted during sexual activities through transfer of body fluids Can spread to eyes (conjunctivitis) and internal organs, cause arthritic meningitis Symptoms in women and men are generally mild and go unnoticed Treatment via combination of antibiotics Syphilis Less common as a result of blood-screening procedures and antibiotic treatment Caused by spirochaete bacterium, Treponema palladum Transmitted during intercourse, direct contact with sore or from mother to fetus Disease progresses in four distinct stages Primary stage characterized by chancre sore, highly infectious stage Secondary stage distinguished by body rash Third stage shows no symptoms, may last years Fourth stage is heart disease, mental deficiency, nerve damage, loss of motor functions, blindness Treated via antibiotics Genital herpes Caused by two types of closely related viruses Herpes simplex Type 1 causes cold sores and fever blisters Herpes simplex type 2 causes genital lesions of genital herpes Transmitted through sexual contact when open sores are evident Herpes virus in body travels along nerve endings to base of spine May remain dormant with no symptoms May become active and produce painful symptoms Initial outbreak produces measle-like lesions, flu-like symptoms May become dormant, outbreaks reappear with stress or exposure to sun Antiviral drugs can lessen severity of outbreaks, not a cure Transmission possible during outbreaks Chlamydia \"Silent STD\" caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium Has both bacterial and viral characteristics Susceptible to antibiotics like bacterium Depends on host cell to replicate, like virus Transmitted via sexual intercourse Women usually do not experience symptoms until infection is established Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease Can lead to sterility, increase risk of acquiring HIV Symptoms in men include watery discharge, burning or itching Tests exist to identify bacteria in discharge Treatment via antibiotics mostly tetracycline, penicillin not effective Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Transmission through contact with infected person fig 30.17 More than 30 strains, three known to cause cervical cancer Warts appear in genital region three weeks to three months after exposure Treatment through various agents to remove warts Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Archaebacteria are distinctly different from all other bacteria Base sequences of rRNA virtually identical in all members Differ from sequences in other bacteria and eukaryotes Cell walls lack muramic acid Have distinctive membranes, unusual cell walls, unique metabolic cofactors Capable of living in anaerobic atmosphere rich in CO2 and H2 Include oldest life forms, ancestral to Eubacteria and eukaryotes Independent evolution of each group Some have ribosomes similar to eukaryotes Others have smaller ribosomes like Eubacteria Include methanogens that produce methane gas Produce marsh gas, natural gas

species.",0.8123552799224854],["Key to this whole process is that the bacteriophage has made a mistake so that, rather than packaging its own chromosome, it accidentally has packaged a portion of the donor cell's (the bacteriophage's host) DNA (e) Note that not all bacteriophage are capable of transducing and that of those that are capable, some are more efficient (e.g., make more mistakes) than others (f) See Figure 8.5, Generalized transduction (g) [ transduction ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (8) Conjugation (a) Conjugation is a mechanism of bacterial sex (or a sex-like mechanism in that it often involves a transfer of DNA but no recombination following transfer) that occurs following the docking together of two bacteria, a donor and a recipient (b) The occurrence of conjugation is due to the presence of certain plasmids in the donor bacteria that posses genes for making the proteins involved in docking and transfer, and then it is these plasmids that typically are what is transferred from one bacteria to the other during the conjugative act (c) Note that the donating bacteria is described as being male and that the act of conjugation (if all goes as planned) serves to convert the recipient bacteria also to a male (thus, one starts with one male and finishes with two) (d) [ conjugation ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (9) Plasmids (a) A plasmid is an &quot;extra-chromosomal&quot; piece of bacterial DNA (b) Plasmids typically are stably maintained within bacterial cells, replicating fast enough that they are passed on to bacterial progeny as the bacteria divide (c) Like bacterial chromosomes , plasmids are circular, double-stranded DNA (d) The major difference between chromosomes and plasmids is that plasmids are much smaller than chromosomes plus tend to carry genes that are not essential except in certain environments (e) [ plasmids ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (10) Resistance plasmids (a) One category of genes found on plasmids code for resistance to antibiotics (b) These resistance or R plasmids often contain more than one bacterial-resistance gene (c) A bacterium containing an R plasmid that expresses the appropriate antibiotic resistance gene can survive when exposed to the antibiotic, whereas a bacterium lacking the resistance gene will not (d) Because plasmids may be readily transferred from cell to cell (e.g., just as snippets of DNA may be transferred from cell to cell), bacteria are capable of acquiring resistance to multiple antibiotics simply by acquiring a single resistance plasmid (e) Put another way, it means that antibiotic resistance can evolve in one kind of bacteria, and then that resistance can be wholly transferred (e.g., via conjugation ), intact, to a new bacterium, including to bacteria that otherwise can cause disease (f) [ R plasmids ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (11) Genetic engineering (a) Genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA to a recipient cell using artificial techniques (i.e., something other than or in addition to sex ) (b) Often this DNA is manipulated in the test tube prior to its transfer (c) There are various means of manipulating DNA and there are various means of transferring DNA to a recipient cell (e.g., transformation , transduction ) (d) Additionally, there are various things that one can do with the DNA that has been transferred to a recipient cell (e) Note that the transferred DNA may be from the same species or from a different species than the recipient (f) Such successfully transferred DNA is said to be cloned (g) [ genetic engineering ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (12) Recombinant DNA technology (a) Recombinant DNA technology represents a number of methods employed to (i) manipulate DNA outside of cells (ii) place manipulated DNA \nback into cells (iii) manipulate that DNA following its incorporation back into cells (b) [ genetic engineering ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (13) DNA manipulation outside of cells ( restriction endonuclease ) (a) The key to manipulating DNA outside of cells is the existence of enzymes known as restriction endonucleases (i) The restriction part of the name derives from the actual use of these enzymes by the bacteria that make them: restricting the replication of bacteriophages (by chewing up the bacteriophage DNA) (ii) The nuclease part of the name means these enzymes cut DNA (iii) The endo part of the name means that they cut DNA in the middle of double helix strands (rather than chewing DNA up from the ends, i.e., as do exo nucleases) (b) Restriction endonucleases cut DNA only at specific nucleotide sequences and thus are tools by which DNA may be cut at specific locations (c) Thus, a specific gene may be cut out of an organism's genome (d) Further techniques allow one to specifically change the nucleotide sequence of the isolated gene (e) See Figure 8.15, Producing recombinant DNA (f) [ DNA technology , restriction enzymes ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (14) DNA transfer to recipient cell ( vector ) (a) To transfer manipulated DNA back into a cell, one typically first inserts the DNA into a vector (b) A vector may be a plasmid ( transformation ) or a bacteriophage chromosome ( transduction ) or both (c) The vector or plasmid are opened up (cut) using specific restriction endonucleases (d) The isolated gene is then inserted into this opening (e) An additional enzyme, DNA ligase, then covalently attaches the gene into the vector, thus making gene and vector into one double helix (f) The vector may then be transduced or transformed into a recipient cell (g) Within that cell the vector is allowed to replicate (h) Often these vectors also contain antibiotic-resistance genes which, in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic, allow only those cells that have successfully received the vector to replicate (i) See Figure 8.15, Producing recombinant DNA (j) [ cloning vector , expression vector ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (15) DNA manipulation within the recipient cell (a) Once the DNA is in a recipient cell, things can be done with it (b) One thing that can be done is to allow the introduced gene to express (e.g., produce a new protein), thus changing the phenotype of the recipient cell (c) A second thing that can be done is the gene product (a protein) can be overly expressed so that the resulting relatively high concentration of protein can be purified and either used for a specific purpose or employed for the characterization of the protein (which often is far easier given a relative abundance of protein) (d) A third thing that can be done is the inserted gene may be sequenced using DNA sequencing techniques;",0.8120391964912415],["It's thought that mitochondria are bacteria that were enslaved by the cells of larger species many
