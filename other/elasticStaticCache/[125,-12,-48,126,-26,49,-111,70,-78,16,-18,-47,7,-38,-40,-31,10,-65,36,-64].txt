[["oil and gas production, and industrial and agricultural activities Municipal solid wastes: garbage - home and business wastes from urban areas - primarily paper, paperboard, and yard wastes - most potentially renewable resources - 13% recycled / 87% landfilled or burned Waste management - throwaway/high-waste approach - - solid wastes are left where they are produced, buried, or burned - based on an economic system that encourages waste production and then attempts to manage the wastes in manners that minimize environmental harm Waste prevention - low-waste approach - based on greatly increased recycling, reuse, and waste reduction Burying wastes: sanitary landfills - account for 73% of US wastes - spread in thin layers, compacted, and covered with clays - can be put into operation quickly with low operating costs and can handle large quantities of wastes - areas can be reclaimed as recreational areas when closed - \ntend to be noisy, high traffic flow, and dusty - landfill materials slow to decompose due to compacting, lack of oxygen and water - anaerobic respiration of bacteria produces methane, hydrogen sulfides, and organic compounds - may be collected as fuels Burning: - kills pathogens, reduces volume by 60%, reduces the need for landfill space, and does not require a change in peoples' habits - releases air and gaseous pollutants and generate toxic fly ash and bottom ash - volume decreased but toxicity increased - trash-to-energy - trash burned to generate steam which may be converted to electricity - most mass-burned - everything burned together without separating out hazardous materials Extending resource use through composting, recycling, reusing, reducing HAZARDOUS WASTES Hazardous waste is any discarded material (some 23 tons/person) that: contains one or more of 39 toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic compounds above tolerant limits is flammable is reactive or unstable enough to explode or release toxic fumes is capable of corroding metal containers Does not include radioactive wastes, household wastes, mining wastes, oil and gas drilling wastes, hydrocarbon-containing wastes, cement kiln dusts, municipal incinerator ash, small quantity generators, and the military Dealing with hazardous waste: Don t make them in the first place (pollution prevention) or use less harmful alternatives recycle or reuse them detoxify them burn them hide them in landfills, ponds, pits, deep wells, or dumping them in the ocean Bioremediation: using biological organisms to break down hazardous wastes U.S. HAZARDOUS WASTE REGULATIONS Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA): passed by congress in 1976 and reauthorized in 1984 requires the EPA to identify hazardous wastes and set standards for their management provides guidelines for state programs all facilities that store, treat and/or dispose of more than 100 kg of hazardous waste/month must have a permit requires a \"cradle-to-grave\" manifest to keep track of wastes transferred from the point-of-origin to approved off-site disposal facilities 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA): commonly referred to as Superfund established a $16.3 billion fund financed by state and federal governments and taxes on hazardous chemicals and industry moneys used for cleanup of abandoned or inactive hazardous waste sites and leaking tanks identified as threats to human health and the environment EPA authorized to collect fines and sue owners of abandoned sites and tanks to cover up to 3X cleanup costs 1200 sites on the National Priority List - 103 - 425,000 estimated sites - 17,000 on military lands only 56 cleaned up enough to be removed from list @ $26 million each WILD PLANT AND ANIMAL RESOURCES Species

Increased use of renewable energy resources Reduction or elimination of toxic and harmful substances in facilities and their surrounding environments Improvements to interior and exterior environments leading to increased productivity and better health Efficiency in resource and materials utilization, especially water resources Selection of materials and products based on their life-cycle

resources, but all depend on hinterlands, areas surrounding the city from which resources are drawn Areas with rich agricultural hinterlands supported the growth of cities Today, hinterlands extend much further Cities may draw on natural resources great distances from where they are located Impacts on Hinterland Creation of the hinterland disturbs natural ecosystems Farming removed native vegetation (forest cover, for example) and replaced it with selected plants Disrupted nutrient cycles (declining soil fertility) Deteriorated soil structure Removed wildlife habitat Altered hydrologic cycle (increased runoff and percolation) Polluted water and air If impacts was severe enough, it could threaten the life of the city (fertile crescent) Modern Impacts on Hinterland Despite the apparent impacts of farming on the natural environment, it pales in comparison to the impacts of the modern city on surrounding areas Industrial revolution increased the amount of energy required and waste generated in the city Industrial revolution was also a chemical revolution On the farm, increased use of inorganic fertilizers Loss of biodiversity with introduction of hybrid crops In industry, new chemical compounds and high concentrations placed new threats on ecosystems Growing Hinterland The new economy and increasing size of cities expanded the size of the hinterland Technological revolutions, especially in transportation, allowed the import of materials (and export of waste) further and further away from cities Today it is very difficult to delineate an urban hinterland Consider, for example, where your next meal originated, or what materials were required to make your clothes Ecological Footprint Despite the difficulty in defining a hinterland, it is important that we be able to define the geographical impact of cities on the world In terms of land, they clearly take up little space (in the US, 75 percent of the population lives on 2 percent of the land) But the amount of land required to support a city is clearly much greater Support includes both inputs and outputs (a city could not exist unless it had somewhere to dump its garbage, for example) One way we can measure the amount of space necessary to support a city is to measure its ecological footprint Ecological Footprint The ecological footprint concept tries to measure how much nature people consume Calculates the number of acres required to support a population the ecological footprint of any defined population (from a single individual to a whole city or country) is the total area of ecologically productive land and water occupied exclusively to produce all the resources consumed and to assimilate all the wastes generated by that population, using prevailing
