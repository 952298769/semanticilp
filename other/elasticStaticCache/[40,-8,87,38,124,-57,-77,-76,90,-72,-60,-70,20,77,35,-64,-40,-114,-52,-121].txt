decide if you want to remove the grass totaly or just till it up when you till you can go thru and pick up the bigger clumps of grass and put them in a compost pile after the garden is tilled and raked up a bit you can decide what and where to plant depending on how your garden is laid out and how many is in your family you can plant plant your taller crops like corn sunflowers etc. towards the south that way the others get some shade from the afternoon sun i usually buy starts of the longer growing plants that is the ones that need a long time till maturity like tomatoes,watermelons,cantelope, things like the lettuce,carrots,beans,peas,can be planted right in the garden as soon as its gets warm i usually buy plants of most the vegetables to put in you can start seeds but since this is your first garden stick with plants but like mentioned earlier the lettuce,beans,peas,corn,turnips,radishes,beets etc.use seeds if your not sure to get plants or use seeds ask your local garden center or nursery they are better \nqualified to handle your local growing needs i live in zone 5-6 and have watermelons,cantelopes,potaoes-white and sweet i live right on the ohio river about 40 miles west of pittsburgh so i am in a micro-climate the river and the mountains keep it warmer i didnt have a garden last year but this year i plan to put in a big one too if

\"AMERICAN CHEESE\" (PARODY OF DON MCLEAN'S \"AMERICAN PIE\") \"AMERICAN CHEESE\" (PARODY OF DON MCLEAN'S \"AMERICAN PIE\") AMERICAN CHEESE - Ryan Wainio A few short hours ago I went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, just to make a sandwich And I knew if I just had some Spam I wouldn't have to use cheese and ham And maybe I'd be happy for a while But something I saw made me quiver I caught the odor of rotten liver Bad food on the first rack The broccoli was turning black I can't remember if I cried When I saw the cheese was old and dried But something made me really sad The day the food went bad So Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze Even the mayonnaise was stinkin' like somethin' died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die Well, do you like to eat olives And if you do, do you want \nsome, I've had enough Even though they're a few years old Do you put cheese on a dinner roll Can the Packers win the Super Bowl And can you reach me from my trance, I don't know Well our janitor is really dim Cause he sees us eating in the gym Oh, he says he doesn't know Why we don't eat on the tables I got bologna stuck between my teeth When I ate it this morning in my pickup truck And I know that I wasn't glad The day the food went bad I started singing Oh my, this American cheese It was hard as a rock When I gave it a squeeze The corn-on-the cob was stinking like something died And everything is moldy and dry This might be the day that I die Now for 10 days I was gone from home Now there's mold that looks like it was purposely grown But that's not how it came to be My neighbor Chester came for some jelly beans But instead he got a bowl of ice cream I had rice that came from Milwaukee Oh, and while my back was turned away Chester ran off with my ice tray I caught him just before He could get out of the door And my two lemons made some rude remarks They weren't yellow, but really dark And there's a feeling that I had The day my food went bad It was stinking Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even tangerines were stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die I used to like to eat bread and butter The bird flew off to see his brother Eight pieces of pie, rotting fast And the ham is foul, so I think I'll pass Cake with three layers, it's time has passed And then Chester ate some cheese and he got gas And my appetite even still resumed But, I don't think I'll be eating anything soon Now I have stomach cramps Ooh, but I'd rather eat a postage stamp Then my fingers touched a banana peel Now I can't have a decent meal I had to go through an ordeal The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock at thirty-seven degrees Even sauerkraut was stinkin' like something died Think of all the food I'll have to buy It almost makes a guy wanna' cry Well the fridge had stunk up the whole place The refrigeration was a big disgrace With no food left to eat at all So, come on it's a symbol of my life My hungers cutting me up like a knife And I picked up a carrot, it wouldn't bend Oh and as I stood there by the fridge The cheese fell off of the second ridge There's no mouse in hell That would eat that cheese that fell And as the time climbed here into the night You'd say the day just wasn't right I couldn't satisfy my appetite The day the food went bad I was singing Oh, my this American cheese It was hard as a rock when I gave it a squeeze Even the applesauce was stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry And this could be the day when I die I went door to door and got on my knees And I begged them for some ham and cheese But they just laughed and they turned away I went down to the grocery store Where I'd bought the cheese from weeks before But the bird there said the cheese was out of stock He showed me meats and corn that's canned Some of them creamed, and some generic brand But now my heart was breaking All the cheese was taken So the three kinds that I eat the most American, Swiss, and Colby Jack They were on a freight train on the tracks The day the food went bad I started thinking From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy Everything in my fridge is stinking like something died And now everything is moldy and dry This could be the day that I die And now I'm thinkin' From now on I think I will try To check the expiration date on the food that I buy

is the hydrocarbon source from which plants synthesize other organic compounds such as COH, protein, lipids as previously mentioned, one must consider the quality of these sources Introduction Most animals obtain energy from food or body reserves/stores (glycogen, lipid) energy is stored in chemical bonds holding nutrient molecules together some bonds have more energy associated with them than others when you have many nutrients comprising a feed, the energy level of that feed can vary substantially availability of energy varies based upon feed ingredient and species growth is the endpoint of net energy Glycogen Molecule Lipid Molecule Introduction Energy goes through many cycles and transformations, always with loss of heat can be released at various rates: gasoline can exploding vs. compost pile nutritional energetics involves the study of the sources and transformations of energy into new products (mainly we are concerned with growth or tissue deposition) of all dry matter we consume, 70-90% goes to synthesis of new products Energy Forms \nMatter and energy are basically the same it is often convenient to consider energy a property of matter (kcal/g feed) nutritive value of food items is often reflected by calories what you are used to seeing in the store is not calories, but kilocalories (kcal s) common form of energy in the cell is ATP Energy Forms All processes in the animal body involve changes in energy the word \" energy \" was first introduced by Thomas Yound in 1807, and defined as \"ability to work\" found in many forms: heat, kinetic, electromagnetic, radiant, nuclear and chemical for our purposes, chemical energy is the most important (e.g., ATP) Heat Energy The measurement of energy requires converting it from one form to another what we
