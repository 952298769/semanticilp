move like giant waves The Moon/Sun interaction produces Spring Tides and Neap Tides The earth's tilt (declination) moves the bulges north and south of the equator Tidal bulges can't keep up with the earth's rotation (1000 MPH) because of their slow speed (450 MPH) and blocking by continents Ocean basins with a natural 12 or 24 hour resonance have high tidal ranges Large ocean basins have rotary tides (circle around a point) Chapter 14: Ocean Waters Ocean Water Origin and Composition Water--H 2 0, polar molecule causes surface tension and high heat capacity Water derived from volcanic volatiles and cometary collisions with Earth Ocean water well mixed, interacts with atmosphere, seafloor, and land Color blue or green because these wavelengths penetrate the deepest Dissolved gasses--more oxygen near surface, more carbon dioxide at depth Nutrients--depleted at surface (removed by organisms which then die &amp; sink) Salinity--typically about 35 , mostly chlorine (19.4 ) and sodium (10.8 ) Density--increases with decreasing temperature &amp; increasing salinity Thermocline--temperature profile caused by solar radiation and water density Thermocline creates the SOFAR channel which confines sound waves Surface (horizontal) Circulation (relatively fast) Driven by surface winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) Controlled by Coriolis Effect and continental barriers Gyres circulate clockwise in northern hemisphere, CCW in S. hemisphere Gulf Stream and similar currents are \"rivers in the ocean\" Eddies north of Gulf Stream Eddies south of Gulf Stream Spin clockwise Spin counterclockwise Warm water cores Cold water cores Stay at surface Sink deep Low in nutrients &amp; life High in nutrients &amp; life Deep (vertical) Circulation (very slow) Driven by differences in water density (due to temperature and salinity) Vertical circulation is often blocked by the thermocline Deep upwelling near poles, shallow upwelling along coasts and at equator Upwelled waters contain nutrients and have high biological productivity Mediterranean Sea water circulates horizontally due to its high salinity Chapter 15: Marine and Nearshore Environments Oceanic Zones Epicontinental Seas--shallow continental arms of the sea (i.e. Hudson Bay) Continental Shelves--shallow flooded edges of continents (i.e. North Sea) Shelf Break--edge of continent where shelf drops off toward deep ocean floor Continental Slope--steep incline, cut by numerous submarine canyons Continental Rise--area of deep-sea fans and turbidite \ndeposits from Slope Abyssal Plains--deep flat areas of the ocean floor covered with clays and oozes Trenches--deepest zones of the ocean, correspond to tectonic subduction zones Transgressions--rises in sea level that flood more of the continents Regressions--drops in sea level that expose formerly covered continental areas Coastal Zones of the United States (from north to south) Glacial Erosion--many fjords and islands with hard bedrock (coast of Maine) Glacial Deposition--peninsulas and islands made of glacial till (Cape Cod) Estuaries--drowned river valleys cut by glacial runoff (Chesapeake bay) Barrier islands &amp;
