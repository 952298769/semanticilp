Photosynthesis is split into two separate parts referred to light dependent and light independent reactions. The light dependent reaction happens when sunlight is captured and used to begin the process, resulting in the creation of a molecule known as ATP. ATP is a free energy containing molecule and is produced through a chain of steps starting when chlorophyll absorbs light energy. The light independent reaction creates glucose through the Calvin cycle, which uses the ATP and carbon dioxide to make sugar. Dark or light independent reactions occur in the stroma of the plant.",0.8492664694786072],["So basically, light energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, and above mentioned are used to generate mechanical energy (one transformation happens here - various forms of energy to mechanical energy) these mechanical energy runs the turbine and generates electricity (second transformation happens here - mechanical energy into electrical energy).",0.849215030670166],["So basically, light energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, and above mentioned are used to generate mechanical energy (one transformation happens here - various forms of energy to mechanical energy) these mechanical energy runs the turbine and generates electricity (second transformation happens here - mechanical energy into electrical energy).",0.849215030670166],["and * energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["Energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["Energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light);",0.8482975959777832],["and c) energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, \nand chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and * energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and * energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and * energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and * energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["and energy transformations (mechanical to electrical, electrical to heat/light, chemical to light, and chemical to electrical/light).",0.8482975959777832],["Energy transformation is the process of changing energy from one form to another.
