OF DARWIN AND MENDEL &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution&quot;--Theodosius Dobzhansky &quot;The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all&quot;--Sir Peter Medawar Biological Species Concept Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1963) Defines species in terms of the gene pool, isolated from other similar gene pools Paleospecies A paleospecies or chronospecies is a morphologically or anatomically defined fossil species Since interbreeding cannot be determined for fossil species, species boundaries are determined by similarity of form The more difference there is between two fossil critters, the more likely they are members of separate species In a long-lived lineage with continuous fossil representation, an arbitrary species line will be drawn when &quot;enough&quot; difference is seen Speciation The process by which new species are produced from earlier ones This is the central process of macroevolution, or evolution at the level of the species or above (genus, family, etc.) Microevolution involves evolutionary change at the level of the population, and is defined by changes in allele frequencies within the population The Origin of Species Speciation occurs when populations of a species become reproductively isolated so that they can no longer interbreed with full fertility Geographic isolation of populations usually initiates the process Separated by a river, desert, volcano, etc. Selection operates to produce isolating mechanisms of anatomy and behavior Modes of Evolution Cladogenesis is branching evolution, the production of two or more daughter species from a single ancestral species Anagenesis is linear evolution, the production of a single daughter species from a single ancestral species Tempo of Evolution Gradualism views evolutionary change as occurring at a slow, steady, incremental rate over time Punctuated Equilibrium views the tempo of evolution as consisting of long periods of stability (equilibrium), followed by relatively short periods of rapid evolutionary change (punctuations) The

billion years ago Planet earth formed about 4 billion years ago Azoic 4.5 - 3.8 billion years ago Inorganic chemical evolution Spontaneous formation of proto-DNA, and more likely RNA molecules from nucleotides Spontaneous formation of proteins from amino acids Linkage of the two forms of molecules, probably through the enzymatic action of RNA molecules Proterozoic 3.8 billion - 570 million years
