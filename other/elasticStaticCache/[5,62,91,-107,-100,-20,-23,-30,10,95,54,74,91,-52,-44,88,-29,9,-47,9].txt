the forest The War Of The Forest The war of the forest, is a story untold, it was fought by the young ones, the damaged and old, It ragged between winds, the sleet and the rain, against the trees and the bushes, of the forest terrain, It started one evening, with the gentlest breeze, that past through the forest, just ruffling leaves, And the trees they ignored it, but that was a mistake, for the winds thought the forest, would be easy to take, The winds called tornadoes, form over the seas, to start their attack, on the peace loving trees, They blew through the forest, the length and the breath, ripping up roots, in the dark forest depths, They called up the clouds, to make it all dark, as they tore at the leaves, the branches and bark, Then the wind started howling, like the banshee's song, the trees tried to fight them, but the winds were too strong, The trees shook with anger, no more could they take, they held out their limbs, to make a wind break, But the winds started swirling, though they couldn t be seen, tearing up bushes, and any-thing green, At the height of the battle, the death toll was high, then the hurricanes came, throwing trees at the sky, The plant life was losing, they couldn t win on their own, so the birds joined the trees, in defense of their home, The birds they were worried, by the winds from the west, if the trees were destroyed, then where would they nest, But the birds and the trees, were losing the fight, because even combined, they couldn t match the winds might, Then the winds asked the lightning, to strike up a fire, to level the forest, was the winds main desire, The lightning struck trees, that were felled in the fight, and they burst into flames, in the dead of the night, When the winds and the fire, had finished their round, all the trees of the forest, had been burnt to the ground, The birds they surrendered, having no-where to hide, and on winning their victory, the winds began to subside, But when the wind wasn t watching, and with help from the rain, the trees of the forest, began sprouting again, And it wasn t too long, till there stood even more, trees than were standing, at the start of the
