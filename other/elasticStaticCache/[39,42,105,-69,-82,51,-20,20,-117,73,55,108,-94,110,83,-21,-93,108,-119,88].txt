rice plants are protected from toxic effects of H 2 S accumulation by associated Beggiatoa which oxidizes H 2 S to sulfur or sulfate 2) Mutualism (Symbiosis) in Root Zone a) Mycorrhizae - are interactions involving mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi - fungus is integrated into the physical structure of the root - fungus derives nutrition from plant roots - fungus contributes to plant nutrition without causing disease - specific association established for prolonged periods - plants with mycorrhizae occupy habitats inhospitable to non-mycorrhizal plants - two types of mycorrhizae: i) ectomycorrhiza (external) ii) endomycorrhiza (internal) i) ectomycorrhiza ( Figure 9.5 ) - fungus forms an external pseudo-parenchymatous sheath (> 40 mm thick and > 40% of dry weight of combined root and fungus) - fungal hyphae penetrate intercellular spaces ( between cells ) but do not invade living cells - root hair formation suppressed, hyphae act as root hairs - most trees in temperate forests have ectomycorrhizae - many fungi involved (e.g. Ascomycetes such as truffles and Basidiomycetes such as Boletus, Amanita, etc.) ii) endomycorrhiza - fungus invades the living cells of root - cells become filled with clusters of mycelium non- vesicular-arbuscular (non-VA) type of endomycorrhiza ( Figure 9.6 ) - occur in a few plants (e.g. Ericales: heath, azaleas, laurel, rhododendrons) - orchids are obligately mycorrhizal vesicular-arbuscular (VA) type of endomycorrhiza ( Figure 9.7 ) - VA type occurs in more plant species than all other types of ecto- and endo-mycorrhizae e.g. Angiosperms (flowering plants) - wheat, maize, potatoes, beans, tea, soybeans, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries, coffee, sugar maple Gymnosperms (conifers), pteridophytes (ferns) and bryophytes (mosses) - enhanced barren soil colonization by pine if seeds inoculated with appropriate fungus but mycorrhiza does not enhance yield if soil treated with fertilizer at high rates - in tropical rain forests, fungi act both as saprophytes that decompose organic matter, and as mycorrhizal fungi b) N-Nodules - important mutualistic relationship involving invasion of roots of suitable \nhost plants by nitrogen-fixing bacteria resulting in formation of nodules within which bacteria are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen - symbiotic nitrogen fixation is important in maintaining soil fertility - in agriculture, relationship exploited to increase crop yield (through crop rotation) - examples: - Rhizobium - legume symbiosis (e.g. alfalfa, clover, peas, peanuts, soybean, beans) - most widespread (see diagram ) - non-legumes (e.g. Alnus (alder), Myrica (Bayberry), and Casuarina) can form symbioses with Rhizobium, cyanobacteria, and actinomycetes - in high latitudes, root nodules formed by actinomycetes in Alnus , are the main source of N -
