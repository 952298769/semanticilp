animal or its offspring stay alive Example: Tinbergen`s gull experiments fig 55.1 Gull parents remove hatched eggshells from nest If broken shells replaced, predation increased White shell interior cues predators Shell removal behavior is adaptive Behavioral Ecology Study of how natural selection shapes behavior Adaptive significance: how behavior increases survival and reproduction Concentration of early studies Habitat selection Avoiding predation Becoming more effective predator Recent studies examine animal`s fitness or reproductive success How behavior is related to fitness = study of adaptation itself Natural selection acts on genetic component of behavioral differences Behavior favoring reproductive success becomes more prevalent over time Test hypothesis by measuring fitness, demonstrating its correlation with behavior May also measure other factors associated with reproduction FORAGING BEHAVIOR Feeding Is One of Most Basic Animal Behaviors Foraging behavior: involved with selection and collection of food Predators may actively hunt, ambush or trap prey fig 55.2 Specialists Versus Generalists Specialists: feed on only one kind of food Example: some ants eat only spider eggs Example: oystercatchers feed on only mussels fig 55.3 Generalists: feed on many different kinds of food Not as efficient as specialists at catching any one kind of food Take advantage of catching many different varieties Behavior is obviously important to growth and reproduction Target of strong evolutionary forces Expect evolution to favor foraging efficiency Calculate net energy of different prey items, size and energy needed for pursuit Predictions made by optimal foraging theory fig 55.4 Animals cannot always maximize energy intake Nutrition and variety of food must be considered Compromises made because of predation by others fig 55.5 SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Definition of Social Behavior Interaction with others of same or different species May be competitive or cooperative Territorial Behavior Home range: daily activity site May overlap with others in time or space May be exclusive and actively defended Territoriality fig 55.6 Individual exclusively uses area with some limited resource Resources may include food or potential mates Defense of area via displays or overt aggression Economic risks of territorial behavior Energy costs versus energy benefits Example: flowers and nectar-feeding birds fig 55.7 If flowers scarce, not worth defending since they do not provide enough energy If abundant, not worth defending, easy to get enough energy Defense practical for intermediate quantity of flowers The Ecology of Reproduction Reproductive strategies: behaviors that maximize reproductive success Include mate choice, number of mates and parental care Evolved in response to ecology, food resources, nest sites, distribution of potential mates Mate choice first observed by Darwin fig 55.8 Female`s evaluate male`s quality, decide whether or not to mate Superior mates should leave more offspring Parental investment and mate choice Contributions of each parent to raising offspring Estimate energy spent by male and female in offspring care Parent with the greatest cost should make choice for mate Generally female, may be male Depends on cost of parental care Fundamental differences between males and females Size of gametes: egg significantly larger than sperm Nutritional value of gametes: egg more than sperm Care costly to females that gestate and lactate Some males increase cost by collecting food, defending and feeding young Males may show mate choice if they have high parental investment Example: male cricket spermatophore = 30% of body weight Females compete for males Males choose large females to produce more offspring fig 55.9 Reproductive competition and sexual selection Reproductive competition: competitive interactions over access to mates Females frequently mate with largest male May be associated with competition between other males fig 55.10 Few males in population may sire most \nof offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define \"individual\" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by \"queen substance\", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed offspring, watch for predators, defend territory Can reproduce but do not for a period of time Nest with helpers have more offspring tbl 55.1 Helpers are often fledged offspring of those they help Resembles family situation Evolution explained by inclusive fitness concept Vertebrate Alarm Calling Activity of certain individuals benefit group at expense to individual Example: meerkats fig 55.5 Individuals act as sentries for group May give alarm call when predator sighted Draws attention to itself to protect others Behavior seems contrary to own self interest Example: Belding`s ground squirrels Colonies female-based, \nmales not related to any females Females with relatives nearby more likely to sound alarm than females with no kin nearby Alarm calling favors nepotism Socioecology Vertebrate societies have characteristic organization fig 55.22 Examines influence of environment on social organization Factors include food type and predation Example: African weaver birds Forest species fig 55.23a Builds camouflaged solitary nest Monogamous mating Eat insects Savanna species fig 55.23b Nest in colonies in trees Polygynous mating Eat seeds Feeding and nesting depend on area ecology Mating form dependent on feeding and expense of being a parent Sociality in African ungulates correlate with diet HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY Theories of Animal Sociobiology and Human Applications Could readily examine human activities Exhibit kin-selected altruism and reciprocity Show extensive parental care of offspring Possess variety of mating systems Exhibit unevolutionary behaviors like adoption Two Processes Led to Adaptive Change in Human Evolution Biological evolution Primate heritage shared with chimpanzees Include kin-selected and reciprocal altruism Traits are definitely adaptive in non-human primates Cultural evolution Transfer of information needed for survival Nongenetic mode of adaptation Passed from generation to generation by tradition Includes use of tools, shelter construction, marriage practices Difficult to identify biological components of human behavior Study cross-cultural traits May have been affected by natural selection May result from genes fixed in human populations Examples: Most mammals and human species are polygamous Many cultures exhibit same greeting pattern Many biologists resist explaining human behavior in evolutionary terms Has been used in past to support racist, fascist, sexist policies Potential for abuse still exists If behaviors are \"hardwired\" negative behaviors like violence and aggression cannot easily be changed Human behavior is affected by innate and learned components Study of human behavior will continue to be
