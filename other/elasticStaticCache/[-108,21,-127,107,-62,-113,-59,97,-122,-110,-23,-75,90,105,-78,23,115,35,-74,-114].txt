To measure the chemical energy stored in food, you will oxidize the food much more rapidly than the cells in our body do by burning it in air. To do this, you will use a homemade bomb calorimeter that captures and measures the heat energy released by burning food. The basic idea of a calorimeter is to release all the stored energy at once and capture all the released heat energy with a reservoir of water. Measuring the temperature of the water at the beginning and at the end of the trial will allow you to calculate the energy put into heating up the water. As all this energy comes from the chemical reaction, the calculation will reveal the actual amount of energy released during the reaction, or the energy originally stored in the food. However, this is only true if all the energy released during the reaction is used to heat the water, and none of it gets \"lost.\"",2.502048969268799],["Where do air, water, food, and energy come
