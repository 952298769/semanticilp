decay away under some rare circumstances, bones can be preserved as fossils the most common form of fossil is formed when the organic material gradually dissolves away and is replaced by minerals that crystallize out of ground water this creates a rock in the exact shape of the bone which is then very durable, and may last long enough to be found and studied the study of fossils is paleontology , done by paleontologists most paleontologists study extinct animals (and plants) that are not primates, as the evolutionary arm of biology the study of fossils \nof animals ancestral to humans and our close relatives is a sub-specialty often called paleoanthropology , done by paleoanthropologists by the way, archaeologists like me do not normally study fossils we study the material evidence of cultural activity by people that is, artifacts, fire pits, living places, buildings, garbage dumps, burials, etc. sometimes that includes the remains of human bodies or other animals this stuff is usually much younger than any fossils so a guaranteed way to irk an archaeologist is to ask him or her if she has found any good dinosaurs recently as you'll see, you don't want to say that to a paleoanthropologist, either... fossils of bones and teeth can tell us a lot about what extinct animals were like not only their body shapes, but also normal forms of locomotion general kind of diet general kind of environment they lived in sometimes something about mating strategies, social groups, etc. and also their phylogeny which ones were ancestral to which paleoanthropologists are also
