nonliving factors, including water, oxygen, light, temperature, soil, and inorganic and organic nutrients autotrophs - organisms that can make all the organic nutrients they need from inorganic compounds biomass - mass of organisms biosphere - the portion of the earth in which living things exist biotic factors - living factors including all the living organisms in the environment and their effects, both direct and indirect, on other living things \ncarnivores - animals that feed only on other animals commensalism - one organism benefits from a symbiotic relationship and the other is not affected consumers - heterotrophs that must obtain nutrients from other organisms decomposers - break down the remains of plants and animals, releasing substances that can be used by other members of the ecosystem ecosystem - includes a community and its physical environment food chain - a series of organisms through which food energy is passed food web - food chains interconnected at various points forming a food web herbivores - animals that feed only on plants heterotrophs - organisms that cannot make their own nutrients latitude - distance north or south of the equator omnivores - animals that feed an both plants and animals mutualism - both organisms benefit from their association parasitism - one organism benefits from a symbiotic relationship while the other is harmed population - all individuals of a particular species within a certain area predators - attach and kill their prey and feed on their bodies producers - autotrophs that can produce their own nutrients from inorganic compounds pyramid of energy - amount of available energy in an ecosystem saprophytes - organisms that obtain nutrients by breaking down remains of dead plants and animal scavengers - feed on dead animals they find symbiotic relationships - two organisms living in close association and benefit at least one of them RESOURCES: FILMS/VIDEO TAPES: Cycles in Nature: Food Webs Ecological Cycles Succession: Ways Ecosystems Change -three sound filmstrips from National Geographic This is the 3960th time this file has been accessed since 11/16/96.",1.540946364402771],["Most living things get the energy and nutrients they need in order to survive through food chains comprised of green plants as food producers, animals as consumers, and decomposers as recyclers.",1.4235080480575562],["Those nutrients cause plants to grow, which feed animals, which feed people, who live, who die, and then start things all over again.",1.3911700248718262],["habitats how are animals adapted to their environment grade 2 how plant and animal needs are met relationships between living organisms and their environment effects of weather grade 3 food chains and webs agriculture and soil grade 5 recognition of nonliving elements of the environment essential to life human impact on the environment communities and ecosystems (optional) grade 6 interactions among living things and the environment which surrounds them (how ecosystems work) populations climate change (optional) grade 7 essential characteristics of life how organisms adapt nutrient cycles impact of humans role of microorganisms (optional) grade 8 abiotic components;",1.3271241188049316],["VOCABULARY community- plants, animals, and other living things existing in one place food chain- the transfer of food energy from the plants through a series of animals with related eating and being eaten behaviors producer- an organism that makes its own food and is the beginning of a food chain ADVANCE PREPARATION 1.",1.3243199586868286],["It includes such things as plants, animals, life cycle of a frog, food chains, food chains, adaptations, and surface tension.",1.3144090175628662],["All of the things which have ever lived and died from insects, to plants, to animals become part of the earth when they die.",1.3025853633880615],["When humans eat carrion- or prey- eating animals, they are partaking of a \" \nfood chain\" which includes things harmful to humans.",1.2960500717163086],["A food chains is a series of food energy steps from plants to \u0006 animals to other animals in a community of living things .",1.2745577096939087],["Most of the animals live in threat of other things, but they help the food chain.",1.2743371725082397],["Flies contribute to the breakdown of vegetable matter and dead things which replenish the nutrient content of the soil which in turn makes it's way to us through the food chain or the oxygen produced by healthy plants.",1.2685139179229736],["Some of the things they filter are small single cell plants and animal that are the organisms food.",1.1858525276184082],["Some of the things they filter are small single cell plants and animal that are the organisms food.",1.1858525276184082],["I think it's a good habitat because many living things enjoy it, it provides many nutrients for things living in it and it provides a food chain for the animals around it.",1.1811585426330566]]
