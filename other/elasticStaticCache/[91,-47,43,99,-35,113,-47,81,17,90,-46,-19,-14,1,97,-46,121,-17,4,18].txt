The reasoning for \"survival of the fittest\" is because populations tend to produce more offspring than an environment can hold. From here, the offspring with successful alleles survive, leaving weaker alleles to die out eventually. Offspring with successful alleles pass down their genes, which makes their species more and more adaptable to their environment. The first type of selection is called stabilizing selection. In stabilizing selection, the environment supports the medium version of a specific trait. This, meaning that a species with the mid-way of a trait will survive the best out of all the other versions of the traits. For example. if there were three rats, one white, one gray, and one black, the gray one would survive. This is because there is something in the environment that supports the survival of gray rats such as camouflage against gray rocks being that the white would be easily seen because it is too light, and the black one would be easily seen because it is too dark. The second type of selection is directional selection. In this selection, only one extreme of the trait is supported. This being that the environment only supports one end of a trait. Going back to the rats, directional selection would take place if there were prominently black rocks. In this case, both the gray and white rats would be too light to blend in. The last selection is disruptive selection. In the selection, both extreme versions of the trait are supported by the environment. With this, the medium is excluded and will die out. Including the rats, the environment can have both white and black rocks, leaving the gray rats to easily stand out and be captured by prey meanwhile the black and white rats will be able to camouflage.  ",1.259555459022522],["Mobbing in animals is an antipredator adaptation in which individuals of prey species mob a predator by cooperatively attacking or harassing it, usually to protect their offspring .

The shape of a bird's beak, for example, will determine what food it can eat. The colour of an animal's fur may provide an effective camouflage against predators; or an animal may have learnt the best way to catch food. Anything that helps an organism to survive and successfully reproduce in an ecosystem is regarded as an adaptation (refer to Topic 3, Chapter 6: Adaptations).",1.2173579931259155],["Camouflage is seen when an organism's coloring helps it blend into its background or environment.",1.2145273685455322],["They are attracted to the airport environment, naturally camouflaged, blend in with the scenery and are rarely seen.",1.2145273685455322],["Prey defenses can be a stabilizing factor in predator-prey interactions. Predation can be a strong agent of natural selection. Easily captured prey are eliminated, and prey with effective defenses (that are inherited) rapidly dominate the population. Examples include camouflage in the peppered moth, and prey that are nocturnal to escape detection. Bats capture moths in flight, using sonar to detect them; some moths are able to detect incoming sonar, and take evasive action. Perhaps seriously unbalanced system simply disappear, and those that persist are ones in which the predator is not \"too effective\", likely because the prey has adaptations to reduce its vulnerability. ",1.1978206634521484],["Camouflage A color or shape in an animal's body covering that helps it blend into its environment.",1.1972076892852783],["The children will learn about camouflage and how animals use it for protection by blending into their environment.",1.1972076892852783],["Some animals have the ability to blend in with their environment this is called camouflage.",1.1972076892852783],["Another function of color is camouflage for both predatory and prey animals to blend into their environment.",1.1972076892852783],["This form of camouflage, known as cryptic coloration, allows animals to blend in with their environment.",1.1972076892852783],["Another function of color is camouflage for both predatory and prey animals to blend into their environment.",1.1972076892852783]]
