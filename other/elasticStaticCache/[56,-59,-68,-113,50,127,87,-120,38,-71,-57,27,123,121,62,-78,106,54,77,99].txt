They use digital sampling technology to accurately reproduce the acoustic sound of each piano note. They also need to be connected to a keyboard amplifier and speaker to produce sound (however, most digital pianos have a built-in amp and speaker). Alternatively, a person can practice with headphones to avoid disturbing others. Digital pianos can include sustain pedals, weighted keys, multiple voice options (e.g., sampled or synthesized imitations of electric piano , Hammond organ , violin , etc.), and MIDI interfaces. MIDI inputs and outputs allow a digital piano to be connected to other electronic instruments or musical devices. For example, a digital piano's MIDI out signal could be connected by a patch cord to a synth module , which would allow the performer to use the keyboard of the digital piano to play modern synthesizer sounds. Early digital pianos tended to lack a full set of pedals but the synthesis software of later models such as the Yamaha Clavinova series synthesised the sympathetic vibration of the other strings (such as when the sustain pedal is depressed) and full pedal sets can now be replicated. The processing power of digital pianos has enabled highly realistic pianos using multi-gigabyte piano sample sets with as many as ninety recordings, each lasting many seconds, for each key under different conditions (e.g., there are samples of each note being struck softly, loudly, with a sharp attack, etc.). Additional samples emulate sympathetic resonance of the strings when the sustain pedal is depressed, key release, the drop of the dampers, and simulations of techniques such as re-pedalling.",0.7592581510543823],["THEORY &#9;A black body absorbs all of the energy which strikes it, heating it until the energy being emitted equals that being absorbed.",0.7568953633308411],["Take a piano and play a melody using only the white keys which are immediately to the left of a black key.",0.7553219795227051],["For example, A sharp and B flat are enharmonic equivalents because they are played using the same black key on the piano.",0.7543666362762451],["For example, in conductive liquids such as salt water, \"ion-drag\" causes heating, as charged ions are \"dragged\" more slowly back and forth in the liquid under influence of the electric field, striking liquid molecules in the process and transferring kinetic energy to them, which is eventually translated into molecular vibrations and thus into thermal energy.",0.7519798278808594],["She holds 2 patents for thermal imaging devices, and was a key developer of the ThermoMeter heat-transfer modeling program.",0.7478750944137573],["(Show us a piano that knows which fingers on a key",0.7469419240951538],["A player piano is an acoustic piano where the sound is produced mechanically by moving keys which cause hammers to strike the piano strings, without using electric or electronic components to create the sounds.",0.7431926131248474],["MIDI can be thought of as being similar to the old piano rolls--rolls of paper with holes in them that could mechanically trigger the keys in specially-made pianos, &#0147;player pianos,&#0148;
