[["Shorelines Waves: agents of erosion and deposition Waves wave height - vertical distance between crest and trough wavelength - distance between waves wave period - time between waves waves move, but water particles oscillate with circular motion, water moves much more slowly than waves water motion to about 1/2 wavelength in depth properties of waves are controlled by wind velocity duration of wind distance over which wind interacts with wave (fetch) in open ocean waves low amplitude - wave begins to slow and break (surf) when ocean depth is about 1/2 wavelength Wave Erosion - Force of wave and material carried by wave abrade rock, break into smaller pieces Rates of Coastal Erosion - Depends on rock type, power of waves and storms Cornwall, England - Granite cliffs, minimal erosion Yorkshire, England - Glacial sediments- 1 to 2 meters/yr Massachusetts - Glacial sediments - 3 to 4 m/yr New Jersey Shore - Unconsolidated sediments 2 m/yr In New Jersey - Storms have removed 30 meters in days In Massachusetts - Thoreau described 130 meters of erosion in one storm Wave Refraction - Waves do not move straight onto beach direction of waves controlled by wind sea bottom topography Waves tend to be focused onto headlands - preferentially erode headlands Headland worn away by attach from sides tend to form caves in sides Arches when caves unite creates arch Sea Stack when arch top falls - stack results - isolated column of rock Beach Drift - Long-shore Drift movement of sediment along beach - due to oblique movement of waves Beaches Sand is - eroded transported to beach \nmoved along beach by long-shore drift cycled between beach and offshore bar transported into deeper basins and deposited Beach Budget - balance of sand brought to beach/removed annual cycle during summer - beach wide waves - long period, low amplitude - constructive - bring sand from bar to beach during winter - beach narrow waves - short period, high amplitude - destructive - removes sand to offshore bars Man alters beach budget by: constructing dams on rivers bringing sediment amount of sediment moved on Mississippi - decreased by 50% reduces beaches - wetlands Barrier Islands - emergent sand ridges - 3 to 30 km from shore and 15 - 30 km long usually 5 to 10 meters elevation Outer Banks, NC - Long Beach Island, NJ Padre Islands, TX large coastal storms/hurricanes may have

highest known waves have occurred: as the result of earthquakes during hurricanes after volcanic eruptions when landslides dumped large amounts of material into small bodies of water An example of a secondary shoreline: the shore of an estuary the shore of a fiord a fault scarp which is partly submerged a barrier island When a wave changes direction in shallow water, the change in path is called: absorption refraction reflection erosion As an oceanic island sinks or is eroded, the fringing reef may be left behind as a circular ring called a(n): crater caldera atoll esker An isolated rock left

beaches with well drained sand dunes.",0.9167094230651855],["waves slow, steepen, break, and form surf surf spends its energy against the beach ( swash ), and the water returns seaward ( backwash ) beach drift : the more energetic swash tends to hit the beach at an angle, but the weaker backwash tends to run straight down the beach, so sand particles tend to move down the beach (see 9.11) Longshore current (9.9) if the wave approaches the shore at an angle, it resolves into a surf component (perpendicular to the shore) and a longshore current component (parallel to the shore) Wave refraction waves approaching coast at an angle tend to bend parallel with the coast this focuses wave energy on headlands and disperses it in bays Tsunamis special type of wave, generated by displacement of oceanic water column, due to: displacement of seafloor by earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, or testing of nuclear weapons may generate a special kind of wave impact by large bolide (meteorite or comet) characteristics high velocity (up to 950 km/hour) long wavelength (up to 200 km) amplitude: 0.5 m at sea, up to 40 m at coast hits the coast with tremendous energy, eroding some areas and laying down thick sand deposits in others most common in the Pacific, e.g., Japan, west coast of Vancouver Island River Mouths the discharge of large rivers into the ocean is an important aspect of coastal dynamics delivery and deposition of sediment, generally resulting in the construction of deltas (see 6.13) delivery of nutrients to coastal ecosystems delivery of freshwater, providing a brackish mixing zone that is also important to coastal ecosystems this mixing zone may take the form of an estuary , an ecologically-rich intertidal zone where the river maintains distinct channels Biological activity another important aspect of coastal dynamics many marine invertebrates produce carbonate skeletons which become important components of some coasts coral reefs (see 9.21) coastal plants and microbes play an important role in binding loose coastal sediment some intertidal invertebrates bore holes in solid rock e.g., sea urchins on the West Coast of Vancouver Island turn the rock into something that looks like Swiss cheese Types of Coasts Rocky (cliffed) coasts (9.15) Beach coasts (9.16, 9.17) rocky coasts and beach coasts often occur in close proximity Carbonate coasts (see 9.21) form in warm waters with little or no non-carbonate sedimentation reefs, atolls, lagoons, carbonate beaches Coastal erosion coasts are high-energy interfaces between land and ocean consequently, coastal erosion is a significant process rocky coasts are worn away beach coasts constantly reconfigured as the sediment is shifted around (9.18) carbonate coasts are also subject to erosion, although they tend to configure themselves in such a way that the reefs bear the brunt of the impact storms are always significant in coastal erosion Coping with dynamic coasts people often live along the coast coasts are dynamic interfaces so there is a risk to people and property (see 9.12, 9.19, 9.24) and to the coastal environment, which is often sensitive (especially carbonate coasts) a variety of coping measures can be attempted breakwaters and seawalls to take the impact (9.22) jetties and groins to trap the sand (9.23) beach nourishment protecting
