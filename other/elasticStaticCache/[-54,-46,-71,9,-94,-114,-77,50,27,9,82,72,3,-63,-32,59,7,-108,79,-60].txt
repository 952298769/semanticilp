sheets Problems Large number of students (300) makes marking a great effort Large number of students means feedback is usually limited and a long time in coming Students only get one attempt - if they get it wrong they may learn very little Tutorial/assessment programme An alternative, automated approach Two sets of weekly exercises : Tutorial set Can perform exercise as often as student wishes Tutorial is different every time it is taken Provides feedback on performance and guidance Available throughout the year Assessed set Can be performed only once Is different for each student Available only during the week it is set Electronics laboratories The current arrangement: Nearly 300 students take the 1st year electronics labs for 3/4 sessions each Students complete a quiz sheet for each session and keep a lab note book Quiz sheets are marked each week and returned during the next session Lab notebooks are marked at the end of the series of labs Electronics laboratories Perceived problems Students concentrate on completing the quiz sheet and keep a very poor record of their work The marking load is enormous - consequently the feedback that can be given is very limited Feedback on the laboratory notebooks often comes very late because of the time taken to mark them Electronics laboratories An alternative, automated approach It is proposed to do away with the quiz sheets and to no longer assess the laboratory notebooks thereby drastically reducing the assessment effort Students would do the labs in the same way and would be required to keep a good record of their work in a notebook After the lab (within the following week) they would be required to take an on-line test Electronics laboratories Nature of the on-line test The test would ask questions related to the laboratory and would be similar to those in the existing quiz - however, they would now be assessed automatically The test would also ask for details of the experiment and so test the students
