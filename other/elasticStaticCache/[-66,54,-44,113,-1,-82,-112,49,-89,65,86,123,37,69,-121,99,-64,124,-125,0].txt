Extended Lecture Outline Chapter 35 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Plants Continue Growing Throughout Their Lives Achieve great size Attain great age Genetically identical individuals propagated for generations Plants Have a Fundamental Unity of Structure fig 35.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE PLANT BODY Basic Plant Body Plan Root system Penetrates soil Absorbs water and ions Anchors plant Shoot system Stems: serve as framework to position leaves Leaves: primary location for photosynthesis Flowers and fruit: serve reproductive functions Tissue Types in Plants Vascular tissue: conducts materials throughout plant Xylem: water and dissolved minerals Phloem: materials needed for growth, carbohydrates, amino acids, hormones Ground tissue: tissue in which vascular tissue is embedded Dermal tissue: outer protective covering, surrounded by waxy cuticle EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT First Stage Is Active Cell Division Zygote divides repeatedly to form embryo Meristems established at root and shoot apices Differentiation in angiosperms begins immediately after fertilization fig 35.2 Zygote divides transversely along long axis Establishes polarity of embryo Lower pole divides to form suspensor Embryo proper divides to form protoderm, procambium and ground meristem Apical meristems detected after six days Shoot meristem grows upward differentiating leaves, lateral branches Root meristem grows downward differentiating root structures Differentiation in gymnosperms fig 35.3 Cell walls do not initially form between daughter cells After eight divisions, embryonic cell contains 256 nuclei Cell walls then form and differentiation begins Cells near micropyle divide slowly to produce large cell suspensor Smaller, rapidly dividing cells at end give rise to apical meristem Plant Development Significantly Different from Animal Development Pattern of development not affected by chemical signals in egg as in animals Plant embryo will develop normally even if removed from ovule Embryo affected by environment as it alters concentration and distribution of hormones The Establishment of Developmental Patterns Axis with one or two \ncotyledons or embryonic leaves fig 35.4 Monocots have one cotyledon, dicots have two cotyledons Absorbs food from endosperm during germination May remain within seed at maturity Tip of epicotyl Contains shoot apical meristem fig 35.4a Portion of stem axis that extends above cotyledons Plumule = epicotyl + young leaves Tip of hypocotyl Contains root apical meristem Portion of stem axis that extends below cotyledons Radicle or embryonic root At lower end of hypocotyl develops into primary root If no radicle, axis below cotyledons is called hypocotyl root axis, has apical meristem and root cap Special development in grasses fig 35.4b Plumule enclosed in sheath called coleoptile Radicle enclosed in sheath called coleorhiza The Role of Seed Dormancy Embryo stops developing at certain point Generally arrested after differentiation of meristems and cotyledons Integuments develop into relatively impermeable seed coat Adaptive importance of seed Development postponed until conditions favorable for plant growth Reinitiation of development tied to environmental factors Seed affords protection at most vulnerable developmental stage Dispersal of seeds permits migration and dispersal into new habitats Seed coat protects metabolically inactive embryo Germination cannot occur until water and oxygen reach embryo fig 35.5 May involve cracking of the seed Seeds may remain viable for hundreds of years Special adaptations assure dormancy Tough fruits only open in response to fire Germination occurs in fire-cleared area Burned plants release abundant nutrients for germinating seed Inhibitory chemicals leached from seed coat in presence of water Prior passage through animal intestines assures dispersal Seeds may germinate in areas where plants are thought to be extinct DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANT BODY Germination First step includes absorption of water Metabolism resumed in presence of water Initial metabolism in seed may be anaerobic Cracking of seed coat allows uptake of oxygen Few plants germinate underwater in total absence of oxygen Additional environmental signals may be required for germination Light of proper intensity and wavelength Stratification, a series of cold days, prevents germination in midwinter Significant fraction of seeds may still remain dormant Called seed pool Provides a genetic reservoir The Mobilization of Reserves Reserves may be stored in embryo or in its endosperm Stored in starch grains of amyloplasts Fats and oils provide additional food reserves Cotyledon modified in cereal grains Forms scutellum that provides first food from its stored reserves Scutellum absorbs food from endosperm Epithelial layer secretes hydrolases to mobilize starch Aleurone layer secretes hydrolytic enzymes Emergence of Root and Shoot Is Extremely Variable Root may emerge first and anchor plant in soil fig 35.5 Cotyledon activity May remain underground May emerge above ground and become photosynthetic Establishment of the Meristems Apical meristems develop from clumps of tissue at apex of shoot and root Primary growth Initiated by apical meristems near tips of roots, shoots Results in elongation and produces primary plant body Made up of primary tissue Comprises soft shoots and roots, or entire plant if herbaceous Secondary growth Involves activity of lateral meristems Vascular cambium: gives rise to secondary xylem and phloem Cork cambium: produces outer layers of bark of roots and shoots Results in thickening of plant body Produces secondary plant body Made up of secondary tissue Comparison of primary and secondary growth zones fig 35.1 How
