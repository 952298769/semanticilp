out into the desertlike the patterns of the mosaics and carpets in the Dome of the Rock that fabulous building I remember the way I felt about the boulders embedded in the dry creek bed and the way the casuarinas all bent in one direction as I sketched them then understanding later that they'd been bent by floods and the whole painting had a sense of aftermath it was the biggest painting I ever did And the woman who was there with me must have been thinking very different thoughts she and her husband setting up house together in a different way from me where their nesting instincts definitely centred on children and in my memory the image of her stomach and her breasts as we lay near our tents under the trees by the river bank and the idea of embryos implanting themselves in the uterine wall are connected For me the painting, structurally a bit like blue poles was more important I could feel the sense of choking claustrophobia and boredom in the other alternative there wasn't much variety of lifestyle in the 60's I remember looking at buildings out of interest in them wanting to discuss ideas being interested in male intellectuals for that reason (being deluded about the

like a blistering wave of heat over the point from the huge and inert silos of White Bay inert by day and by night I remember the inner city lifestyles of the 70's the kitchens, the tarot, the numerology the herbal tea, things that are institutionalised now my world straddling the women's movement and the small press scene when performance was the only way we could reach an audience in times before the institutionalised creative writing courses and the massive takeover by the multinational presses marketeers reaching into our back rooms and kicking us out whitewashing the whole

correct, actually not like now when people are too scared to say boo as though the tidal wave myth actually came true in a metaphoric sense, sweeping away everything in its path and the survivors are the ones who retreated to the country or just retreated into a defensive position I remember a dream I had of a wide salty sea the water shallow and whitish with salt there was nothing but water, no land and I swam up to a figure draped on a dead tree an old female relative, so old that her body was like silky hemp she had no clothes only long blond silky hair she was more than helpless, she was no use outside the water her body had the stiffness of hemp but in the water she was amorphous like fine seaweed it seemed like the previous generations weren't going to be much help and this proved
