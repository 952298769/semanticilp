experience force to make it orbit the Earth (otherwise it would just travel in a straight line) - also applies to planets as they orbit the Sun Newton: the same force that makes things fall to Earth could also be responsible for orbital motion of the Moon Earth's gravity constantly pulls the Moon towards the centre of the Earth, bending its path into a curve (FIG 2.21) size of force depends on mass of Earth, as well as the mass of the object - if either was more massive, gravitational force between them would be stronger since the force of gravity depends on mass, all objects that have mass exert a gravitational force on each other Newton: the strength of the force must decrease as the distance between the objects increases - necessary to produce stable orbits to account for Kepler's 3rd Law (relates size and period of orbits) - the force must decrease in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between the centres of the objects (inverse-square law) m 1 and m 2 are the masses and r is the distance between their centres e.g. if the distance is doubled - force changes by a factor of 1/2 2 =1/4 e.g. if the distance is increased by a factor of 10, the force decreases to 1/10 2 = 1/100 its original size All objects interact though their gravitational field Newton's Laws of Motion and his Law of Gravitation - can derive all of Kepler's Laws result: the period of the orbiting object also depends on mass of central object these laws allow us to predict and control the orbits of satellites around Earth Centre of Mass and Orbital Motion Newton's 3rd Law implies that if the Sun is exerting a gravitational force on a planet, planet must also be exerting an equal force on the Sun Since Sun's pull causes the planet to follow an elliptical path - planet must also cause the Sun to move in an ellipse Sun is not stationary at the centre of the solar system Motion of the Sun is very small compared to the motion of the planet Newton's 2nd Law: a=F/m size of the force (F) that they each exert is the same Sun accelerates much less because its mass (m) is so much larger than that of a planet (300,000 times the mass of the Earth) e.g. the centre of mass of the Sun-Jupiter system is just outside the surface of the Sun Both objects orbit around common point - centre of mass : located at one focus of each orbit each object will orbit with the same period but have its own semi-major axis.",1.3599358797073364],["Thus, if the mass of a given object can be varied while being oscillated either in a linear or orbital path, such that the mass is high while the mass is moving
