adaptation to its sub zero habitat include a compact body with short legs, short ears, dense fur, and thickly haired foot pads, which insulate against the cold and provide traction on ice Like many Arctic animals, the arctic fox turns colour with the seasons to stay camouflaged In winter the Arctic Fox is a brilliant snow white colour (although some may appear to have blue-grey patches of fur) As the snow melts the Arctic Fox sheds its warm coat and grows a brown one In September and October, the Arctic Foxes begin to grow their white coats as the temperature cools and snow begins to fall Mating occurs in early March and early April Gestation lasts 52 days Litters average seven pups but may contain as many as 15 pups During the spring and summer months the Arctic fox can be found
