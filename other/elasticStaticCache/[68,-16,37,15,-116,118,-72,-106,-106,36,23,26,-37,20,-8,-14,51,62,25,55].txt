[["Many organisms have found ways to use sunlight to make a different form of energy, much like a solar panel does. These organisms use this energy for survival. Plants, some protists, some bacteria, and blue-green algae have each developed a way to absorb and use energy from sunlight to produce sugar and other organic compounds and then use the sugar as energy (which is used like an electric current) (Bailey, 2012). The process by which these organisms make energy for themselves using sunlight and certain elements from the physical world is called photosynthesis. In a very general sense, organisms take energy that was produced in the sun and convert it to chemical energy. The chemical energy is then used to power the organism.",2.558298110961914],["Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.",2.5439162254333496],["Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.",2.5439162254333496],["If a paint were created using photonic crystals that don't absorb the color green--the most intense color in the spectrum--then a car \nwhose exterior was coated with that paint wouldn't absorb green light and would remain cooler when exposed to direct sunlight.",2.4896655082702637],["The reason for this is because the methane absorbs much of the red light from the impinging whit sunlight, which leaves a bluish green color in the reflected sunlight.",2.397897720336914],["The reason for this is because the methane absorbs much of the red light from the impinging whit sunlight, which leaves a bluish green color in the reflected sunlight.",2.397897720336914],["Trees are really green solar panels collecting sunlight and converting it into ... sugar.",2.3715178966522217],["â€¢ Why are leaves green for most the year?
