(algae and higher plants) light strikes P680 and P700 more or less simultaneously electrons move from both reaction centers to their electron transport chains ETC from P700 directs electrons to NAD+, the acceptor making NADPH ETC from P680 directs electrons to P700, filling the gap left by the electrons leaving P700 electrons are ripped from H2O to fill the gap left by the electrons leaving P680 -
