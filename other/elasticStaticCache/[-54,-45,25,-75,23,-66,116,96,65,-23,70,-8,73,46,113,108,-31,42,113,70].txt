[["Where do air, water, food, and energy come from?",2.4459409713745117],["In this project you will learn a method for measuring how much chemical energy is stored in different types of food and express your result in Calories (note the capital \"C\"), as this is the unit of energy widely used to quantify food energy. To measure the chemical energy stored in food, you will oxidize the food much more rapidly than the cells in our body do by burning it in air. To do this, you will use a homemade bomb calorimeter that captures and measures the heat energy released by burning food. The basic idea of a calorimeter is to release all the stored energy at once and capture all the released heat energy with a reservoir of water. Measuring the temperature of the water at the beginning and at the end of the trial will allow you to calculate the energy put into heating up the water. As all this energy comes from the chemical reaction, the calculation will reveal the actual amount of energy released during the reaction, or the energy originally stored in the food. However, this is only true if all the energy released during the reaction is used to heat the water, and none of it gets \"lost.\"",2.33012318611145],["The energy needed to accelerate the air comes from the energy stored as compression of the gas, so the gas expands, and its pressure drops.",2.2161707878112793],["The energy needed to accelerate the air comes from the energy stored as compression of the gas, so the gas expands, and its pressure drops.",2.2161707878112793],["In fact, most of our energy requirements come not from food but from the air we breathe.",2.0210771560668945],["In fact, most of our energy requirements come not from food but from the air we breathe.",2.0210771560668945],["In fact, most of our energy requirements come not from food but from the air we breathe.",2.0210771560668945],["In fact, most of our energy requirements come not from food but from the air we breathe.",2.0210771560668945],["In simple terms, the energy comes from combining food in our bodies with the air we breath.",1.9567527770996094],["In simple terms, the energy comes from combining food in our bodies with the air we breath.",1.9567527770996094],["Briefly, Qi is the vital energy which comes from heaven (air), earth (food) and ancestors (genetic vitality).",1.9567527770996094],["Greenhouse gases exist naturally in air, heating it by trapping energy that has originally come from the Sun.",1.9374070167541504],["Greenhouse gases exist naturally in air, heating it by trapping energy that has originally come from the Sun.",1.9374070167541504],[") tiny air freshener (from the health food store.",1.9068679809570312],["These are energy fields that come from the mineral and air kingdoms.",1.8016129732131958],["My body stored this food energy, and can use it to do work on a bean bag, by throwing it up in the air, and converting the food energy to energy of motion.",1.7608585357666016]]
