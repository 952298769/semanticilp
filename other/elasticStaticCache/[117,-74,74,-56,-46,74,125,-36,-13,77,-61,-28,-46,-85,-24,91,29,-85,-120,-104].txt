An example of a producer is a tree or flower which uses the sunlight to make food. A consumer is a living thing that depends on other living things to get is own food. All animals would considered consumers because all animals depend on plants and other animals to get there own food. Like a wolf hunts other animals to feed or a bird gathers food from plants. Decomposers are livung things that consume dead organisms. Scavengers and detritivores fall in this category. The main decomposers are Fungi and Bacteria.

The main idea is that a food chain all begins with the producer (plant) making food on its own using the sun's energy. A food chain shows the relationship between different living things in a particular environment or habitat. Often, a plant will begin a food chain because it can make its own food using energy from the sun. Also, a food chain represents a series of events in which food and energy are transferred from one organism in an ecosystem to another.
