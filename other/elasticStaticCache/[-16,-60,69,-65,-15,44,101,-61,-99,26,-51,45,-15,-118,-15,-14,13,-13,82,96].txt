[11] Others note that on some species ( Plumbago auriculata ), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbago's mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.

Basically, tho…ugh, insect jobs appear to range from support for the worldwide food web to participation in scientific research. Within that web, insects take on important roles as prey, predators and pollinators. Particularly as prey, they're important sources of protein. As an example, they provide otherwise unavailable protein to such carnivorous plants as the Purple Pitcher [Sarracenia purpurea]. Be they digested as prey, or dead and decaying by other means, insects become equally important sources of nutrient rich organic matter in soil. So digested or otherwise, their body parts contribute to the health of the soil and the well being of its plants and soil food web members. Additionally, insects are means by which important scientific breakthroughs are achieved. For example, the fruit fly [Tephritidae and Drosophilidae families] is a cooperative, popular research tool for many scientists.
