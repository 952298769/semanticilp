[["The tree's extremely long needles make a significant contribution to the islands water supply, trapping large amounts of condensation from the moist air coming off the Atlantic with the prevailing north eastern wind (locally called \"alisios\"). The condensation then drops to the ground and is quickly absorbed by the soil, eventually percolating down to the underground aquifers.",2.2899036407470703],["Gravity, surface tension, evaporation and condensation, hydraulic pressure and friction control the movement of water through the soil.",2.243042469024658],["If the soil is uniformly moist, there appears to be no movement of the water because the rates of evaporation and condensation are in balance.",2.243042469024658],["If the soil is uniformly moist, there appears to be no movement of the water because the rates of evaporation and condensation are in balance.",2.243042469024658],["Gravity, surface tension, evaporation and condensation, hydraulic pressure and friction control the movement of water through the soil.",2.243042469024658],["The hydrologic cycle: The hydrologic cycle refers to the constant process of evaporation of water from the oceans (and to a lesser extent from lakes, forests and soil), its assent into the atmosphere, its condensation into clouds, its movement on the wind and its deposition as rain or snow.",2.181567907333374],["the repeated movement of water through the environment in different forms.
