long-term variation in the amount of incoming solar energy striking the earth's surface - uneven heating of the earth s surface - rotation of the earth on a tilted axis - properties of air and water - results in air cells and prevailing winds Earth's rotation, axis inclination, prevailing winds, and differences in water densities also cause ocean currents upwelling - cold, nutrient-rich bottom water moving to the surface replacing surface waters flowing away from land masses el Ni&ntilde;o - Southern Oscillation - periodic event when prevailing westerly winds weaken or cease and Pacific surface waters near the coasts of North and South America become warmer, suppressing upwelling and affecting global weather patterns Chemical content of the atmosphere also affects climate: greenhouse gases: CO 2 , ozone, methane, CFC's play a role in determining temperature - absorption of heat leads to greenhouse effect Ozone in upper atmosphere absorbs and blocks UV radiation - depleted by human activities Topography also influences climate: - mountains interrupt flow of prevailing surface winds and moisture flow -
