reactions occur at the same active site Decarboxylation reaction of photorespiration requires oxygen Little photorespiration occurred prior to the O2 atmosphere C3 plants lose one fourth to one half of their fixed carbon in this way Loss is related to increased temperature Oxidation of RuBP increases more than its photosynthesis Tropical plants adapted to counteract this problem The C4 Pathway
