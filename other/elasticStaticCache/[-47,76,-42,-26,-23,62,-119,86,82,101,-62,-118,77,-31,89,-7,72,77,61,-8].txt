Activity 3 - Soil Air1. Ask each student group or pair to place 1 cup of dry soil into a 2-cup container.2. Students should slowly pour 1 cup of water into the soil container until the soil is “saturated” or all the dry soil is “mud.” While they were pouring the water they should notice the “air bubbles” that are rising to the surface.3. Students should measure the amount of water left and subtract it from 1 cup.4. Lead students to infer that the amount of water in the soil sample was approximately the amount of air that was displaced. As the students added the water to the sample, they should have seen bubbles, until the sample was saturated.5. Have students compare the amount of water that they were able to pour into their soil samples. There will be differences depending on the soil texture and organic matter. What is the percentage of air in the soil sample? If they were able to add a 1/4 cup of water, the sample contained 25 percent air.6. Using the components of the soil transparency, and the movable yarn, explain how air and water amounts change.Discussion1. What are the components of soil? (mineral matter, organic matter, water, air)2. Which two components are the most variable? (water and air) Why?3. Why do worms come up to the surface after a drenching rain? (to breathe)Background Soil is naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose material at the surface of the earth,which is capable of supporting plant and animal life. In simple terms, soil is comprised ofthree components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase which accounts for approxi-mately 50 percent of the volume in a typical soil is a mixture of mineral and organic matterand gives soil its mass. Soil particles fit loosely (depending on the particle size) leaving“empty” pore spaces. The pore spaces are then filled with water (liquid) and air (gas). Thewater and air in an “average” soil make up the other half of the soil’s volume. All soils are made up of the four major components; however the portions will vary. Themineral matter is derived from the weathering of hard rock at the earth’s surface. An“average” soil is made up of approximately 45 percent mineral content by volume, theamount and size of mineral particles vary. In an “average” soil, the amount of organic matter (living and dead organisms) willrange between 1 and 5 percent. Organic matter is mostly composed of dead plant andanimal remains. This decay in the upper layer of soil, or topsoil, is the major source ofplant nutrients and other organisms. Organic matter is what makes a soil fertile. Soils highin organic matter do not compress as tightly allowing for more air spaces. Organic par-ticles also hold the moisture by absorbing water. Water is held in the small air spacesUtah Agriculture in the Classroom 10",1.5031782388687134],["For water based liquids (i.e. salt water, add color if desired) Students place celery stalk (also cut under running water) in each cup Use a marker to mark the height of the liquid Have students wrap plastic wrap around the top to eliminate evaporation from the cup.",1.5008171796798706]]
