Thus, the trait will become more prevalent in future generations. _ In ARTIFICIAL SELECTION (selective breeding of dogs, for instance), can produce such a variety of different breeds, then Darwin hypothesized that NATURAL SELECTION could produce speciation. _ Here’s how it works: o Cells contain chromosomes, which are molecules that contain the recipes for producing the proteins that cells need to grow and to perform their functions. o These “blueprints” get altered, through a mutation : A change in the genetic information contained in the chromosomes of sperms or eggs, which can be passed on to an organisms’ offspring; provides genetic variability. o Most mutations are not advantageous, they provide a sort of handicap to the offspring. But every so often the mutations confer a selective advantage : A characteristic of an organism that permits it o produce more than the average number of offspring of its species. _ The effects of the physical alterations can be seen in our behavior. o Example: if a mutation occurs changing the structure of the brain, which tells an animal to freeze upon viewing a novel stimulus, this animal will be less likely to be preyed upon, giving it a selective advantage.
