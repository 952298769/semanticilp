Some authors have considered there to be as many as four, but most have been content simply to divide them into ‘upland’ (variously referred to as Greyhound, Hill, Highland and Mountain foxes) and ‘lowland’ (Terrier, Mastiff, Cur, Little and Common) foxes; upland animals are said to be larger, with longer legs, coarser greyer fur and increased stamina over their smaller, shorter-legged, orangey-red lowland conspecifics. How many, if any, of these breeds are actually distinct remains to be demonstrated, but several studies have shown that Scottish foxes are generally larger than English ones, closely matching Scandinavian foxes in size; some have suggested they’re descendents of stock imported from the continent. The suggestion has also been made that the long winter nights at high latitude could allow the foxes longer to hunt when food is hardest to find and more food could allow them to grow larger. Another suggestion is that the increasing day length leads to increased primary productivity (plant growth), which could translate to more available fox food. Either way, the larger size implies an adaptation to upland areas, where food is more widely dispersed and less predictable and weather conditions are harsher (larger bodies lose heat less quickly than smaller ones, which helps in cold environments, while longer legs can be a bonus in snow).",1.3211665153503418],["Evicting a den of foxes Keeping these animals from moving in should be your first step, but the following ideas will help discourage and evict unwanted foxes: If you are not sure foxes are using a den site, look for fox fur and food remains nearby.",1.2960714101791382],["Survival Adaptations - Island foxes can run quickly over grasslands and hillsides to catch prey.
