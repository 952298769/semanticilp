We now understand the alternate forms of these units as ‘ alleles ’.  If the two alleles that form the pair for a trait are identical, then the individual is said to be homozygous and if the two genes are different, then the individual is heterozygous for the trait.",1.6192387342453003],["Knowing a fund family s inheritable traits tells what you should expect from its funds.",1.348270297050476],["It is likely that the citrus fruit, which was of Chinese or Indochinese origin, inherited its western name from this area, in which it was grown.",1.346287488937378],["It is likely that the citrus fruit, which was of Chinese or Indochinese origin, inherited its western name from this area, in which it was grown.",1.346287488937378],["Probably, you would like to know exactly what traits are inherited;",1.3346285820007324],["The yellowness is inherited from its mother plant (seed parent), a small-sized variety known as \"Ōgonkan\" or \"Golden Orange\", which has been crossed with the Imamura Unsiu variety of Satsuma orange for size and other desired traits.",1.3192932605743408],["The planet evidently takes its name from Liberia, a country in Africa, which would explain a dark-skinned genetic inheritance.",1.287192940711975],["(The planet Libair takes its name from Liberia, a country in Africa, which would explain a dark-skinned genetic inheritance.",1.287192940711975],["dominance-recessiveness : disappearance of one parental characteristic in the F 1 and its reappearance in the F 2 convinced Mendel that both traits were present in the F 1 but one ( the dominant ) was preventing the other ( the recessive ) from being expressed -- we now know that many, though not all traits have dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance.",1.2836787700653076],["\"Autosomal Dominant Inheritance\" is a name used to describe a situation where a child inherits a condition or characteristic from ONE of its parents.",1.269051432609558],["Would you like to know its name?",1.2412879467010498],["If you know the name of a company, or a trade name, and would like to know which advertising agency does its ads.",1.2312098741531372],["This vine gets its name from the small thorns at the base of the leaves, which looks like a cat's claw.",1.2226738929748535],["This vine gets its name from the small thorns at the base of the leaves, which looks like a cat's claw.",1.2226738929748535],["This vine gets its name from the small thorns at the base of the leaves, which looks like a cat&#39;s claw.",1.2226738929748535],["Each style inherits its name from the area it which it originated.",1.2220348119735718],["You would like to know which parents you need to breed together to get that desired trait.",1.201590895652771]]
