A female frog lays hundreds of eggs, after which the male fertilises them. These eggs are exposed to wind, rainfall and other animals who feed on them as well. Therefore, to make sure that at least a few of them are fertilised, the female lays hundreds of eggs. A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs. This whole mass of fertilised eggs in the jelly is called a spawn. After a few days, the tadpoles hatch out of these eggs. They then feed on the yolk of the egg from which they hatched. After a few days, the tadpole develops External gills for breathing and fins and a tail for swimming. After a few weeks external gills disappear and tadpole develops hind limbs. After a few days tadpole develops into a froglet. It develops forelimbs. It also develops lungs for breathing. Final stage: Tail of the frog becomes smaller and finally disappears. Frog has entered the adult stage. This entire transformation from the egg into an adult frog through drastic changes is called metamorphosis.

A few tolerate brackish water, but there are no true sea water amphibians. Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water whatsoever. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, bypassing the tadpole stage entirely. Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. The larvae (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior gills. After hatching, they start to transform gradually into the adult's appearance. This process is called metamorphosis. Typically, the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults, but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction. The most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land. But there are several other changes: * The gills are replaced by other respiratory organs, e.g. lungs. * The skin changes and develops glands to avoid dehydration * The eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water * An eardrum is developed to lock the middle ear * In frogs and toads, the tail disappears",1.669509768486023],["31 Amphibians: Frogs and Toads No tails as adults Frogs are aquatic; toads are terrestrial.
