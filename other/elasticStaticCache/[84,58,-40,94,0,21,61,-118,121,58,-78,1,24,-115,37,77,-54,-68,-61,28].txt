down, holes punctured through half chewed Gristle, debauchery with dead bodies, turning green Upheaveal of human entrails Deterioration of grated genitals, dangling from the hooks Obscene feelings deep inside me Dislocating, separating a blood Drenched body Begin the anal grounting Awaiting insertion, to rip out intestine Bodily destruction Vulgar molestation Treachery never ending soul ripping Lifeless Bodies not, petrified Cloggins veins Presure building Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate Condemned to life of obscurity Dismal dimensions of my being, I explore my thoughts through murder Devoting my life to mutilation Screams of blood saturate, grubs feed on dilapidated Stumps, darkness overshadowing the killing Eyes \nnow dialate Bodies disintegrate Razor sharp hooks implanted in your rectum Splitting bodies, spilling guts on the ground Sodomizing living beings with my utensils Stabbing on your life stripped of all your skin Disgusting to the world Beauty to my eyes The body lying naked, discharging my infection Invigorating while I kill, intoxicating Invoking suffering on human beings Grinding orifices my only therapy Sculpting gore Muscle tissue Reshaping Mounds of flesh, deformation Skulls of victims stacked like trophies Bleeding from your arse sudden blood ejection GUTTED A table of the deranged, this savage brutal being A shocking way of life living on human offspring Murder of the innocent, his pale grey face expresionless Horrid dismemberment One persons tortures, is anothers pleasure Malformation, a diseased brain Unsuspecting slowly dying, as his knife invades The child, screams of pain, no one hears Blood splotches now appear, esctasy through Each cut, now the body twiches the gutted Little torso ready to be cooked Isolated in his own mind the need to kill Now possesses his body Self mutilated Between killings ejaculation, cut off appendages Of former victims, sexual violence satisfaction Disembodied corpses, spewing gore On his body, soaked with their fluids, various Digestive parts, and assorted meats Plunging his fist down the throat, ripping out The guts, internal extraction The entire body bleeding The heart stops pumping The child lying dead, just another gutted infant To satisfy his hunger, temptations of the flesh Voracious appetite Killing to release pure souls to the heavens Justification of his killing self-torture Stiffening pain He sees the faces of the dead Guts are strewn from the children Splintered bones, poke through skin Gratification through castration Roasting parts for consumption LIVING DISSECTION Fingers missing from hands, ready to snap bones And necks, pierced together from dead tissue Body parts crudely sewn, face is smashed to pulp drooling from an empty socket Brain half Dead Hungry for flesh Many souls commanding my existence My body alive, I defy, the life I've been given I should have remained dead Experimenting on dead tissue, convulsing bodies on the table Reanimation of the dead, rusty scapals cutting skin Pieced together parts and parts Transplanting human life Rotten organs, restal pus Spitting up your galbladder Donation of bodily organs carved from broken bodies Eyes melting, skin exploding Every bloody bleeding Meat inter-changed from the mutalated stiffs Parts of the dead are never to rest Lymphatic nodes Implode, while the brain corrodes Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead Creation of a being never known to man Heart pumping pus through the body, sliced in sections, the putrid infection Regaining life from beyond To rip the flesh from your bones Stripped of flesh, unsighty Torn in two, slicing through you Live organs needed to be reanimated Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor, now he lies Dead Awaiting a new brain Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead Exposing their insides, slitting their necks Finding a way Bringing life to the corpse, one dead on my table Soon to walk again Fingers missing from hands Ready to snap bones and necks Pieced together from Dead tissue Face is smashed to pulp, drooling from An empty socket Brain half-dead, hungry for flesh Many souls commanding my existence, my body alive, I derfy, the life I've been given I should have remain dead UNDER THE ROTTED FLESH Under the flesh Rot my lust for decayed corpses dead bodies exhumed Their coldness induces me endless defilement, re-occuring relapses, perverse with the dead, soon I will kill for myself Impending suffering, spasms shooting through me nausation A cannibalistic necrophile violating the body, putrefied, mouldering, gorging on the rotted flesh Cutting off the body's head drinking from its severed necks as I rip the corpse in half Human shit for nurishment Coprophagia, consuming feces of the dying, as their bowels let loose defecation flows down my throat excremental injestment Reflections of things to come, mirored in the dead one's eyes my fantasy of murder Incarnated open wounds gushing, blood on skin coagulated tortured of the retched, no one cares of their dead appaling odor wreaking, piles of rotted bodies The bodies prepared for slaughter, wallowing in your own blood Grinding of your fingers and toes feeding on your meat I immerse my sharpened implement into a fresh bleeding gash her body used for my sick desires The blood thirst I can't control Many more must suffer Disposal of the dead, the corpse chopped to bits licking up the drivel The gore enrages me All I kill a new creation, my work of art bodies torn apart Liver quivering at my feet Eyelids cut off to watch your own dismemberment, cutting through arteries nerves exposed Feel the power of pain COVERED WITH SORES Bleed on me, digesting the clotted scabs Blood thirsty Ungodly Passing on my curse, the spell pussing gores Of those I infect become my loyal servants To ride me of my own rot Whittling meat from the bones of the dead Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge The mutilated bodies I leave rotting after I Have fucked them with my knife Becoming a product of my own nigtmares A bleeding sac of infection, years deceased I hide my slobbering skin Covered by a victims flap I love to watch the blood ooz down the bodies stump Like scap, a vulgar way of life, my hideous side Now revealed Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past Leaking membrane, consuming bodies Carving out the cunts, blood my lubrification Spewing pus on rotted skin I celebrate my Cruelty, boils begin to form, dripping on my tongue Swallowing throbbing glands, the juice leaks from My lips, my only thirst is pus eruption of cysts Incurable disfigured bodies, I rape the dying Horrific sights now manifest, penetrating inner organs The ruptured organs leak the fluid that I seek To break the incantation of my damnation Split wide open, \nbloated organs burst Nerves uprooted, re-opening healed wounds On my body Sucking on the sores Ingesting my own fluids Self-parasitic puss indulgement VOMIT THE SOUL Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass Evil controlling my mind, the fear of dying expired of life, to vomit the soul I am dead within my self The end a beginning to a new life in hell I am your path to ever-lasting pain mass extinction of the human population Son of the devil the evil incarnation Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals, the child born unto evil, trapped within the statue of flesh Vipers travel through bodily orifices, blessed by the Devil under inverted crosses, religious ways, lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves I search for decay packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast I suffer forever living only to dismember Open season on humans, laughing I watch them die, they bleed so easily Their blood flows through my body, I need to taste the flesh exposing pulsing arteries Removing vital organs Not stopping till you've died Puts from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts Constricted corpusles coagulating blood my drug a slave to its taste, reincarnated to human form, creating a race of immortal beings, rot away dead bodies, set a flame Searing flesh, broken necks You can't kill what already dead De-evoulution, hunting for life Cannibalism, immortality rip and slash A society of mass murder Bleeding slow I take away your life, and leave you lying cold, decapitated body Searching for its head Anticipate apocalypse, rising dead dismembering Hacking limbs bleeding, cracking ribs Torture us Blessed by the devil, under inverted crosses Religious ways, lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves Desolate Empty hollow corpse, desecrate forced To eat your flesh Extracting purity violat Twisted bodies, rot away BUTCHERED AT BIRTH Birth is always painful, Decaying in the womb trapped within this body A bleeding human tomb gutted bitch lies dead emptied of the child chewing on the cords its life line to this world afterbirth is flowing The stench is overwhelming My body, growing stronger, my pain turns to torture Severing its bloodline A butchered infant carcass Meat from the unborn, the freshest kills Chopped up children bathing in blood Contoured and festering I rot in disgust Re-generation of my body Mother ripped apart Smashing in her face My knife cutting holes, fucking her remains Esophogus carved out Crushing cartilage Bile oozing from punctures in your liver Riping meat within Chewing in intestine Bladder spurting urine, sight of defecation now grow infection The child ripped to shreads Drinking its excretions Zombification ejaculation over mutilation On the Mothers body hacked into pieces The sludges from my cock gives her life once again Sewing the remains of the child deep within her Reborn through evil My torture known throughout Hell Heed to his calling, the demons await my next kill Carnage is my fetish Body cavities scraped of guts Brains seeping from cracks as my axe continues to hack RANCID AMPUTATION Torsos hang from their own intestines Raped of all bodily extentions, stumps wreathing in a sludge Like infection Suffering through a Rancid amputation A pulsating artery accomanied by some veins, slit with no restraint Sacs of pus develop My muscles tighten as I feel the rush I look at your body starting gush I slice through the limb, a human dissection portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth starting to chew your now bleeding stump I will swallow your pus your own rectal slime I'll force you to drink Vessels explode as needles injected Uncontrollable My brain tormented Slit from head to toe, die through the torture Disease engulfs you Internal rot Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot Ripping through flesh is what I do best Tear off an arm Amputated neck Eyes removed, cranium smashed Decomposing remains, severed in half Dying slowly never to rest, nerves are quivering as I trip Removal of life on the blade of my knife Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone Feel my hell, I feed on fright Rape the limbless cadaver INNARDS DECAY Rotting alive Tearing my way through the meat Driven to kill, my brain twitching for guts Devoted to evil Severed arteries gush Hungry for the blood Life is to decay Victims meet my blade, carving out organs A world of pain and terror Visions of the future Premonition of the evil, forthcoming eve of darkness The chosen one will come Eyes torn out bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks Demented madman Unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light Live inside the shell Feed upon infection At one with the dead I rip my way through Easy prey, disfigured bodies decompose Chewed limbs drip with pus, intestinal strangulation Humans left ripped apart Lap up the dripping goo Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh Internally you rot away My need to kill Induced by hate, betrayal of trusted ones My mark left on this earth, victims of my slaughter Souls of my dead, murdered by my Hand Blood on my face, innards decay Snapping necks chewing flesh Insatiable thirst For blood Slicing throats viciously uncontrollable insanity Tear out the beating heart Engulf the quivering spleen, chew the meat Death is my life Life is to decay victims Meet my blade carving out organs, a world of pain And terror, visionsof the future Premonition of the evil Forthcoming, eve of darkness Eyes torn out bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang From broken necks, demented madman unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain If you have any comments, questions, contributions then E-mail me at: lichter@telia.com All copyrights belong to their owners
