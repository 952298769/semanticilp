GROUND WATER Aquifer - the underground water supply these are water-bearing layers in bedrock well water comes from this source Water held in aquifers contains chemicals that dissolved from the rocks of the particular geological formation where the ground water is found two common chemicals found in ground water from local aquifers are iron and sulfide these chemicals are not found in surface water because they react with air and leave the water (sulfide as a gas and iron as a precipitate) E] SURFACE WATER Surface water is the water found at the surface of the land and it includes rivers, streams, ponds and lakes Power plants are located near surface water because they use the water for: steam production use for cooling of power generating equipment used to \"scrub\" the smoke generated from burning high-sulfur coal An important chemical that is found naturally in surface water (and ground water) is silica found in nearly any water that touches the ground silica comes from the degredation of silica containing rocks silica is relatively non-toxic to humans F] POINT SOURCES Point source pollution - pollution that enters the environment from easily identifiable origins includes toxins released by industry, sewage treatment plants, gas stations, etc. this type of pollution has decreased in importance as federal and state clean water laws have been enacted G] NONPOINT SOURCES Nonpoint source pollution - pollution that enters the environment from wide-spread human activities (usually arriving in the water supply as the result of run-off of toxins after rain) typical sources are the insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used by homeowners and farmers this is the most important type of pollution introduced into the water today it is very difficult to regulate and control Ammonia Nitrogen is a common nonpoint pollutant in water that indicates the breakdown of organic compounds (often as a result of decay of dead organisms in the water) H] ALGAE BLOOMS Algae bloom - an expolsive growth of algae on surface water usually caused by fertilizers (chemical fertilizers or animal feces) entering the water usually the result of nonpoint pollution can kill organisms in the water by lowering the supply of oxygen in the water Chemical fertilizers typically contain 3 major ingredients: Nitrate Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potasium (we tested for the first two in lab) I] pH pH - the relative acidity of water pH scale goes from 0-14, with 7 in the middle representing a neutral pH (the pH of pure, distilled water) pHs below 7 are considered to be acidic (the lower the pH, the more acidic the solution is) pHs above 7 are considered to be basic (the higher the pH, the more basic, or alkaline, the solution is) the pH of ground and surface water is kept near neutral, to slightly basic, in this area due to reactions with carbonate in local rock and soil the pH of rain water (and snow) is slightly acidic due to a reaction with carbon dioxide in the air (causing the formation of carbonic acid) even lower pHs are caused as sulfur dioxide from coal burining factories and power plants mixes with water vapor to form sulfuric acid in other cases, lower pHs are caused when nitrous oxides from automobile exhaust mixes with water vapor to form nitric acid rain with low pH caused by either of these two situations is called acid rain J] BIOLOGICAL MAGNIFICATION Biological Magnification - the accumulation of poisonous materials in organisms as these materials are passed through the food web these poisonous materials are resistant to change or destruction in the environment producers accumulate small amounts of these chemicals in their tissues herbivores (primary consumers) accumulate larger amounts in their tissues as they eat affected plants carnivores (secondary, tertiary, etc. consumers) accumulate even larger amounts in their tissues as they eat affected animals these chemicals are not \ndestroyed by the body when consumed, nor are they removed in the waste products, rather they generally are captured and stored in the fat of an animal and they can build up slowly but surely over time Common examples of toxic chemicals that can be passed through food webs this way include heavy metals (such as lead, cadmium, and mercury) and persistant insecticides (e.g. DDT) Because most game fish are higher level consumers (usually tertiary and above), they can accumulate hazardous amounts of these toxic chemicals that are of concern to humans that eat them to lower the risk of long-term poisoning caused by eating affected fish, remove and discard the fat (as this is where the chemicals accumulate) this can be done by removing the skin (most fat in a fish is right under the skin) and not using the liquid which comes off the fish when cooking (some of the liquid represents liquified fat from the fish) K] DRINKING WATER Chlorine - a chemical that is often added to drinking water to kill microorganisms in the water Cisterns - a common local water supply that relies on collection and purification of rain water (it relies on living things to purify the water, a biological purification process) Lead - a chemical that is not wanted in drinking water.",0.5839133262634277],["Flushing of Organic Contaminants from a Ground Water Plume at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal: Field and Laboratory Studies.",0.5838969945907593],["First,
