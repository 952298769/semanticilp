cells perform interrelated functions in any organism Discuss, using observation, experimentation, and modeling, the connections between the structure and functions of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems Construct models that demonstrate which chemical elements make up the molecules of substances found in living organisms and how these elements pass through food webs Describe how essential materials enter cells and how waste and other materials leave the cell (e.g. passive transport and active transport) Explain how cells use nutrients as a source of energy (e.g. respiration, photosynthesis) Compare the transformation of matter and energy during photosynthesis and respiration Ecology Students will be able to: Relate different kinds of animals and plants to their habitat by observing their physical characteristics Develop appropriate food webs for the major biomes of the earth and accurately describe the major biogeochemical cycles which control the interactions between the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem Investigate the interdependence of plants and animals in the biomes of New Hampshire Predict, with rationale, the effects of changing one or two factors in an ecosystem Research and present a model that demonstrates how ecosystems are reasonably stable over hundreds of thousands of years, dependent on climate, limiting factors, carrying capacities, and biogeochemical cycles Make predictions about changes in the size or growth rate of a population using mathematical models (e.g. graphs charts, exponential growth curve, logistic growth curve, carrying capacity) Trace the history of an interaction between man and the environment that demonstrates how human activities can deliberately or inadvertently alter the equilibrium in an ecosystem Design and perform an experiment to show that the number of living things any environment can support is limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, minerals, and ability of an ecosystem to recycle organic material Classification (Taxonomy) Students will be able to: Identify and give examples of representative life forms in the five kingdoms of living things Identify and describe differences among organisms of different, but closely related taxa Human Biology Students will be able to: Describe/explain homeostasis (e.g. the maintenance of internal stability within organisms)

mutations of DNA, gene linkages, crossing over) Explain, in general terms, the role DNA plays in controlling cell functions Evolution Students will be able to: Construct a \"time line\" that depicts how life forms change over time as they interact in and with the environment Explain the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of organisms Discuss how changes in the DNA can
