around the circle: RV camping at the Alyeska hotel parking lot, shepherd squatters to a permanent facility to burn legal fires with a waste facility, hauling off garbage from the Forest Fair, restriction of length of stay from 2 weeks to 3 days, private for profit, expensive to develop, utilize numbers and problems from 2000 temporary campground as a basis for permanent area, lots of illegal camping and parking in lots and along roads, lots of camping along local trails, shower house for tent camping, tent trailer parking, permanent park and recreation contractor, use municipal owned campgrounds as a model, ask the Municipality if they want to do it, keep subcommittee diverse, background work, KOA with everything, Portage valley style, need hired manager - must be on site manager, Tom Yeager has run 20-30 different financial scenarios on campgrounds - can be profitable based on a whole lot of assumptions, teepees, large motorhomes, establishment of a campground will encourage more squatters and be like the Homer spit, rv area separate from tents, more important than profit is having a place for the people already camping here and there to go, have a branch of the Girdwood Community Club run the campground, someone must be paid, volunteers are burning out on current local projects, squatters will not pay at a campground, permanent structures in the woods exist now, lots of things to consider and hurdles, do not eliminate things too early - but if we decide we do not want RV's (or we do) let that be known, Girdwood Resort Association gets 6+ requests per month specifically asking about campgrounds in Girdwood, Denise Halliday gets daily requests during the summer at the Girdwood Library and 2-5 RV's park in the school parking lot each weekend with 1-2 nightly, RV's ok - but port-potty's with well pumps and fire pits - simple, maybe power, what is the community willing to support, has been very controversial in the past, no showers, do both kinds of campgrounds - adjacent or separate, low impact, forest service type - not like the gravel pad one near Denali, copy Granite Creek or Williwaw - many agreed, permanent or temporary - permanent was agreed, indicator of the quality of town we want to have in the future - keep it quality with showers and all kinds of camping - require operator to provide services - \n20 or 30 acres with a wilderness experience - spacing for privacy and aesthetics, fire pit - like Dawson - make it profitable $5 - $20 + $30, year round vs just summer - people are living outside year round anyway - may use rv's all winter, the riff raff is good since many present started out living in Girdwood in camps and cars, fire pits and tables are important, no Motorhomes - keep out of the valley, hotel has $5 shower with swimming, start small, do not view as a profit maker, day limits, rotation to allow grounds to fallow, land is worth too much here, offer a benefit to the community, need to police status quo or establish campground, do not be short sited - plan for long term, start small then experiment, deciding factor will be public funding for riff location, private sector would require KOA style, Dawson creek, 2-300 people in the past - now too many to let it \"flow\", give to parks and recreation to run for \"free\" on our tax dollars - unlikely in current climate, don't rule anything out - defer to sub-committee, HLB land with restrictions for fit and built with private development, needs to be the best campground in the state of Alaska - if it's going to be in Girdwood, RV's squatting all over the valley in the summer, work in stages - watch behavior, big public parcel to plan 20 years - suitable for all types of camping, foresight to take charge, beat a private developer to the punch so the facility will be acceptable, once you say yes - it will be on the burner forever, city will not likely be interested, public sector pays - then run by private enterprise, Portage campground cost $1 million to have a low- impact campground, what is a campground?, if Parks &amp; Recreation is a sponsor HLB can sell or lease land at less than fair market value to a non-profit concessionaire, money aside - there is a problem now, careful what you ask for - you might get it, can't stop RV's unless you have a place to put them, Hope Campground, master plan 100-200 acres similar to Birch wood in Chukka with cabins for retreats and outdoor seminars with or without combination with the hotel, Tessera has a dump station with water, winter camping so locals can enjoy, shakedown camp for teen and other summer and winter outdoor programs, designate area or areas large enough, take economic advantage of our \"hippie\" image, create an atmosphere of retreat, bring in
