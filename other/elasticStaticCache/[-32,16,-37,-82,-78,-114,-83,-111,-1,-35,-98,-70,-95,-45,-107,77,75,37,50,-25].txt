Provide adequate supervision and guidance to youth drivers Make certain youth drivers take a certified training class and periodically review safety guidelines with them Join a snowmobile club that

approved helmet, gloves, boots and layered clothing including a wind resistant, water-repellant outer layer State Maternal and Child Health staff should meet with staff of state agencies responsible for youth snowmobile training and enforcement to discuss methods to: Encourage cooperation between local public health agencies, state and local snowmobile clubs, and agencies responsible for enforcement of snowmobile laws Evaluate the effectiveness of laws, safety training, and snowmobile design changes to reduce snowmobile-related injury among youth Increase access to and availability of operator safety education classes and groomed trails Sponsor or conduct research to identify effective injury prevention strategies for youth Establish and maintain an emergency medical system
