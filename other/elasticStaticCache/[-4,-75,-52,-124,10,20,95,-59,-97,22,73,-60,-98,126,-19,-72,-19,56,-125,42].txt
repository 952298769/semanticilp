[["When a soccer ball is kicked along the grass surface, there is always a force parallel, but opposite of the ball [5] . This force is called friction. The friction force is tangental to the surface and opposite to the ball. Friction is caused when two opposing surfaces make contact with each other. The electromagnetic forces within each surfaces resist the relative lateral motion of objects, in this case, it is the ball and grass. However, friction can also happen when the ball is in the air. Because air is matter, friction is always present. Friction is the reason why the soccer ball always slows down. People sometimes confuse gravity as the force that slows down the ball, but really all gravity is doing is increase friction because is forces the ball down against the ground and when that happens friction occurs.",1.9052168130874634],["It is the force of friction which causes the ball to rest.",1.4018899202346802],["Thus, for instance, even though a soccer ball consists of billions of atoms, we are sure that the forces between atoms within the soccer ball cancel out, and the trajectory of the ball as a whole is determined solely by external forces such as gravity, wind drag, friction with the ground, and the kicks of soccer players.",1.3820087909698486],["Friction with the ground causes air to pile up.",1.3753018379211426],["(friction)  When the ball hits the ground, it gets squished, which causes friction between the different rubber molecules that make up the ball, and the friction heats the ball up.",1.3633501529693604],["Rolling is caused by friction between the ball and the ground on which it rolls.",1.2074651718139648],["Rolling is caused by friction between the ball and the ground on which it rolls.",1.2074651718139648],["Besides the disagreements between the ground forces and air planners, the targeting process has also been a source of friction between the Air Force and U.

The hotter something is, the more thermal energy it has.  So when we see the ball bounce back up almost to its original height, we know that it is always a little bit lower than it started because it has transformed some of that original potential energy to thermal energy.",1.1149671077728271],["it is friction or air resistance which causes the elephant to fall faster than the feather.",1.1086221933364868],["This creates sufficient friction force F to be generated, which causes the spin and horizontal velocity component of the ball to reverse direction after impact with the surface.",1.0824720859527588],["A ball free falling with no air friction III.",1.079123854637146],["A ball falls under the influence of gravity (a constant 10 N/Kg) and air friction (and the ground - when it hits it).",1.0701754093170166],["Without friction the ball spins in place, but with friction the ball applies a force to the ground and the reaction force both cancels much of the applied couple and causes the ball to begin translational motion.",1.0576550960540771],["A well-rounded compact stream leaving a nozzle at a velocity sufficient to carry it across the space between the fire fighter and the fire should be entirely effective were it not for the following factors: friction of the air force of gravity Which tends to pull the water toward the ground, causing the stream to fall far short of it's target.",1.047663927078247],["Friction is one force causes a ball to roll downhill .",1.0415704250335693],["If you consider the case where there is friction, if the force is again applied to a stationary ball the frictional force will act in the opposite direction to the force but at the edge of the ball that rests on the ground.
