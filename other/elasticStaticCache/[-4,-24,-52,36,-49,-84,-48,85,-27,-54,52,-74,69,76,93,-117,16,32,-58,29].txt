[["It is believed that millipedes have the same senses as we do: sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. But little is know about their senses and their accuracy. Millipedes have compound eyes with which they sense light, including ultraviolet light. They generally can feel sound with their body instead of hearing it with ears. Their antennae are used for the sense of taste and smell.",1.4759607315063477],["Using taste or smell to determine objects --",1.4508328437805176],["Using taste or smell to determine objects --",1.4508328437805176],["Using taste or smell to determine objects --",1.4508328437805176],["Using taste or smell to determine objects --",1.4508328437805176],["Taste and colours are not necessary conditions under which alone objects A 29 can be for us objects of the senses.",1.3303526639938354],["Taste and colours are not necessary conditions under which alone objects can be for us objects of the senses.",1.3303526639938354],["Taste and colours are not necessary conditions under which alone objects A 29 can be for us objects of the senses.",1.3303526639938354],["Taste and colours are not necessary conditions under which alone objects can be for us objects of the senses.",1.3303526639938354],["Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. [62] Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. [62] Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. [62] Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. [62] Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. [62] The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. [62] Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. [62] For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. [62] The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. [62] Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. [62] An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. [62] For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. [62] Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make. [62]",1.2816500663757324],["Consider first the sensory abilities of animals. All actions (such as body movements, detection of objects of interest, or learning from others in a social group) begin with the acquisition of information. Thus, an animal’s sense organs are exceedingly important to its behaviour. They constitute a set of monitoring instruments with which the animal gathers information about itself and its environment. Each sense organ is selective, responding only to one particular form of energy; an instrument that responds indiscriminately to multiple forms of energy would be rather useless and similar to having none at all. The particular form of energy to which a sense organ responds determines its sensory modality. Three broad categories of sensory modalities are familiar to humans: chemoreception (exemplified by the senses of taste and smell but also including specialized receptors for pheromones and other behaviorally important molecules), mechanoreception (the basis for touch, hearing, balance, and many other senses, such as joint position), and photoreception (light sensitivity, including form and colour vision).",1.2451584339141846],["In fact when it comes to our sense of smell humans rely larger on their ability to smell their foods so that they can determine how it tastes, and without the ability to smell our ability to taste our foods would diminish significantly, with a large number of foods tasting almost exactly alike.",1.232534408569336],["In fact when it comes to our sense of smell humans rely larger on their ability to smell their foods so that they can determine how it tastes, and without the ability to smell our ability to taste our foods would diminish significantly, with a large number of foods tasting almost exactly alike.",1.232534408569336],["Thus, both of these sushi test the itamae's ability to cook and is a reflection of his skill and therefore, helps you determine if the itamae shares the same sense of taste as you do.",1.2239346504211426],["The five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch can be used to locate and identify objects.",1.223130702972412],["The five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch can be used to locate and identify objects.",1.223130702972412],["a. ability to taste and smell b. ability to use energy c. ability to grow and develop d. ability to sense and respond to change",1.1836233139038086],["a. ability to taste and smell b. ability to use energy c. ability to grow and develop d. ability to sense and respond to change",1.1836233139038086],["It can also help restore impaired senses, such as the ability to taste and smell.",1.1788697242736816],["It can also help restore impaired senses, such as the ability to taste and smell.",1.1788697242736816],["Jellyfish can sense smell and tastes using chemoreceptors.",1.1770323514938354],["Jellyfish can sense smells and tastes using chemoreceptors.",1.1770323514938354],["Jellyfish can sense smells and tastes using chemoreceptors .",1.1770323514938354],["The skin s ability to sense cold and warmth, detect light, taste, and touch makes it the body s largest sense organ.",1.1618547439575195],["The skin s ability to sense cold and warmth, detect light, taste, and touch makes it the body s largest sense organ.",1.1618547439575195],["The ABILITY to sit, the ABILITY to move, the ABILITY to laugh, the ABILITY to cry, the ABILITY to feel, the ABILITY to think, the ABILITY to use the senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)... these are the areas to remind oneself of how much we can do, how much ABILITY we have.",1.1612387895584106],["Damage to gum tissue Increased sensitivity to cold and heat Loosened teeth which can eventually fall out Reduced sense of taste and ability to smell.",1.1356098651885986],["Damage to gum tissue Increased sensitivity to cold and heat Loosened teeth which can eventually fall out Reduced sense of taste and ability to smell.",1.1356098651885986],["Caterpillars can sense touch, taste, smell, sound, and light.",1.1332180500030518],["Caterpillars can sense touch, taste, smell, sound, and light.",1.1332180500030518]]
