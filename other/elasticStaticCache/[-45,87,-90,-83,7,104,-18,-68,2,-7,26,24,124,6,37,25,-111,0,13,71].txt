animals that feed only on other animals commensalism - one organism benefits from a symbiotic relationship and the other is not affected consumers - heterotrophs that must obtain nutrients from other organisms decomposers - break down the remains of plants and animals, releasing substances that can be used by other members of the ecosystem ecosystem - includes a community and its physical environment food chain - a series of organisms through which food energy is passed food web - food chains interconnected at various points forming a food web herbivores - animals that feed only on plants heterotrophs - organisms that cannot make their own nutrients latitude - distance north or south of the equator omnivores - animals that feed an both plants and animals mutualism - both organisms benefit from their association parasitism - one organism benefits from a symbiotic relationship while the other is harmed population -
