be described using 2 terms Capacity - the total load of a sediment that the stream can carry (this increases with discharge) Competence - measured by the largest particle size the river can carry (this increases with velocity) Stream Deposition Temporary deposition - bars, flood-plains deposits End - Delta, Alluvial form sketches Bar - a ridge of sediment (sand, gravel) deposited in the middle
