[["The lateral eruption remove 2.8 cubic kilometers of rock and sediment from from the volcano and lowered its height by 400 meters.",1.8671250343322754],["- when rocks are heated to their melting point - the confining pressure around hot rock is reduced - the water content of the rock is increased (for &quot;dry&quot; rocks) 26 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS ORIGIN OF MAGMA Formation of Basaltic Magma - partial melting of peridotite - reduction in pressure is the more important control - as magma rises, pressure decreases, resulting in the lowering of melting temperature 27 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS ORIGIN OF MAGMA Formation of Granitic Magma - partial melting of water rich rocks subjected to increase temperature - the water content is the most important control - as the magmas rises, escape of water, pressure decreases, thus lowering the melting point - the magma often solidifies in the sub-surface 28 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS ORIGIN OF MAGMA Evolution of magma 1) partial melting (composition, temperature, confining pressure and water content) 2) magmatic differentiation 3) assimilation 29 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS DISTRIBUTION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS Rift zones - occur where lithospheric plates separate (divergent zones)- exclusively basaltic magmas - fissure eruption but occasional vent eruptions - magma originates from partial melting of peridotite - landforms include extensive flood basalt (seafloor), oceanic ridges and shield volcanoes 30 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS DISTRIBUTION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS Subduction zones - occur where lithospheric plates converge - associated with andesitic and granitic magmas - vent-type eruption but occasional fissure eruptions - eruptions are explosive - magma originates from the partial melting of descending water rich ocean crust and continental sediments 31 CHAPTER 3 IGNEOUS ROCKS DISTRIBUTION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS Subduction zones - landforms include volcanic chains or Island arcs with andesitic and rhyolitic volcanoes n ocean/ocean subduction (Aleutian Is.)",1.5231152772903442]]
