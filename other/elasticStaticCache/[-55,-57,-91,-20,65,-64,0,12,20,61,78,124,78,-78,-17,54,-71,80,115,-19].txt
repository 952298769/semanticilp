documents on the computer rather than printing numerous drafts E-mail instead of memos Use one main bulletin board to post information instead of giving each employee a copy, or use e-mail as a bulletin board Re-use large mailing envelopes for office mail Use circulation envelopes Eliminate duplicate copies of magazine and catalogue subscriptions Take your name off mailing list (advertising mail and faxes) Recycle office paper (use both sides of paper before recycling), cardboard, newspaper, aluminum cans, magazines, plastics, glass, etc. Discontinue purchasing neon (Astrobright) papers (non-recyclable) Use reusable mugs in break room instead of Styrofoam Compost food waste and/or coffee grounds (Contact Idaho GEM Stars for information on indoor worm composting bins) Reuse Styrofoam peanuts and wood pallets Compost Grasscycle (leave grass clippings on the lawn) Use durable items during staff parties/functions (e.g. flatware, plates, cloth napkins) Use concentrated cleaners Purchase products with the least amount of packaging Use rechargeable batteries Re-use/Recycle Toner Cartridges Repair rather than replace Reuse file folders, binder clips, rubber bands, three-ring binders, etc. Energy Conservation Turn off lights in rooms when not in use Use energy efficient lighting and light fixtures Use natural lighting whenever possible Set heating and cooling cycles for business hours Maintain your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system Set &quot;sleep&quot; modes for copy machine, fax machine, and computers-Use of sleep or stand by mode for copy machines uses 70 % less energy Reduce your hot water temperature Install shades for windows Purchase energy efficient equipment Close doors to unused rooms Encourage employees to carpool to work or use public transportation Encourage employees to use stairs instead of an elevator Coordinate errands to eliminate unnecessary driving Close window shades or drapes in the summer to minimize the need for air-conditioning Install thermal window panes Water Conservation Avoid watering landscaping during hottest part of the day Check for leaky faucets and toilets Install low flow toilets Install low
