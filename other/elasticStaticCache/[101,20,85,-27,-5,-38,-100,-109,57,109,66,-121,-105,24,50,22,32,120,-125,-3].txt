Every land animal depends to some degree on green plants. Photosynthesizing plants take carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and use energy from the sun. Some of the light energy as it interacts with chlorophyll, is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Light energy is then used to join hydrogen and carbon dioxide together to form a new molecule: sugar.
