[["(glacial deposits) 14 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Transitional (Shoreline) - Deltas (deposits where rivers enters oceans or lakes - Beach - deposits of sand landward along the land/sea boundary - Barrier Islands - sand body built along the coastline but detached from it 15 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Transitional (Shoreline) - Lagoons - semi enclosed body of water between a barrier island and the mainland - Tidal Flats - areas covered by water at high tide and exposed at low tides - Coastal wetlands - accumulation of mainly plant material to produce coal 16 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Marine - Reef (buildup from marine organisms) - continental shelf (shoreline to ~120 m depth) - continental slopes - seaward from the continental shelf - deep marine (sea fans) - abyssal floor (deposits in the abyssal plains) 17 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT - sedimentary structures are formed - compaction of sediments - conversion of sediments to sedimentary rocks Lithification is the process of conversion of sediments into sedimentary rocks 18 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Sedimentary Structures - features of sedimentary rocks that result from an interplay of depositional processes and the type of sediments (e.g. stratification) - acquired during deposition or shortly thereafter but before the sediments are converted into sedimentary rocks 19 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures (structures concurrent with deposition) Stratification (Bedding) - the most characteristic feature responsible for layering of sedimentary rocks - Strata or beds or layers distinguished by color, texture or mineral composition - bedding planes represent a break in deposition or change in the type or source of sediments 20 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures Cross Stratification or Cross-bedding - beds are inclined at an angle with respect to the upper and lower surfaces - forms mostly in sand size sediments (deposited on steep local slopes) - indicates transport and deposition by a flowing medium mainly wind and water waves and often used to infer the direction of sediment transport 21 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures Ripples - small, nearly parallel ridges and troughs formed in lose sand by moving water or wind - types: &#9;1) asymmetrical or current ripples (formed by bi-directional currents) &#9;2) symmetrical or oscillation ripples (formed from unidirectional currents) 22 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures - Ripples are important in inferring: &#9;1) direction of fluid flow - ancient current directions &#9;2) depth of water for water deposited sediments &#9;3) environment of deposition (stream bed, tidal flats , shores of lakes and seas) 19 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Primary Sedimentary Structures Graded bedding - characterized by decreasing particle size from the bottom to the top of the bed - commonly formed when poorly sorted sediments are deposited rapidly in water 24 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Secondary Sedimentary Structures - structures formed after the sediments have been deposited and are not related to the depositional process 25 CHAPTER 6 SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT Secondary Sedimentary Structures Mud cracks - polygonal cracks that form in fine sediments (muds) when the sediments shrink as it dries - suggests that the depositional environment was alternatively covered by water followed by drying conditions e.g. shallow lakes, tidal flats, flood plains, desert basins etc .",1.2151092290878296],["Complex deposition and transformation processes take place between sources and the lake ecosystem.",1.21443510055542]]
