Build the container - select the material: plastic or wood - determine the size: I' x 2' x 3' = family of 4-6 ---people, 2' x 2' x 8' = 2 people - drill 12 small holes in bottom for aeration/drainage - cover with a black plastic sheet to keep light out and moisture in - place a large sheet of plastic underneath the container - put box in any convenient place where temperature = 55 -77 degrees F. - do not place in direct sunlight B. Select bedding material - shredded corrugated cartons - shredded newspaper/computer paper animal manure decaying leaves - peat moss may be added to any of the above C. Prepare bedding - add water to the bedding at a 3:1 ratio - mix together in a large container - add 2 handfuls of soil - dump into worm box D. Add worms - only redworms may be used (redworms like to eat garbage) - purchase through: mail-order catalogues (e.g. Cape Cod Worm Farm 508-759-5664), - local bait stores, organic gardening magazines - keep a 2:1 ratio of worms (lbs.) to garbage/per day (lbs.) - add worms as needed - place cover on top of container 5-15 minutes after adding worms E. Add your garbage - bury garbage 1-2' under bedding on a convenient basis (weekly, bi-weekly, or whatever meetsyour needs) - keep a record of how much was buried and where add: a) all vegetable and fruit scraps b) coffee grinds and tea leaves/bags c) moldy cheese and egg shells d) spoiled food (i.e. baked beans, spaghetti) do not add: a) meat products (these products attract rodents and become smelly) b) plastic, metal, or glass items (worms do not eat these products c) rubber bands or aluminum foil d) pet urine/feces F.

A table or board placed next to or across the worm-bed frame and covered with waterproof plastic will serve the purpose. One or more containers for the harvested worms, and about 2 inches of pre-soaked peat moss for the bottom of each container, will also be needed. Use a pitchfork to carefully lift off the top 3 or 4 inches of bedding and place it into the harvesting board. Harvesting should always be done in bright sunlight or in the light of a bright overhead bulb. The worms will burrow down nearer the bottom of the bedding to escape the light. Using either your hands or a small broom, gently sweep off the top of the bedding pile. Wait a few moments for the worms to burrow down and then repeat the process. When all the bedding has been swept off the pile, a solid mass of worms will remain.",1.17551589012146],["Places specified number of worms into sales container and scoops required amount of growing media into container to sustain worms.",1.150133728981018],["Places specified number of worms into sales container and scoops required amount of growing media into container to sustain worms.",1.150133728981018],["Places specified number of worms into sales container and scoops required amount of growing media into container to sustain worms.",1.150133728981018],["Places specified number of worms into sales container and scoops required amount of growing media into container to sustain worms.",1.150133728981018],["Water the soil immediately.

An oxalis grows best in rich, slightly moist soil and bright sunlight. Full-sun exposure is best in winter, and some protection from hot, afternoon sunlight is best in summer. Yellowing sometimes occurs when the plant's soil does not drain properly. A container housing an oxalis should have holes in its bottom to allow water to drain freely. Overly wet soil can damage the plant's roots, making it much harder for them to absorb nutrients the plant needs. An oxalis plant that cannot absorb iron suffers from chlorosis, which causes its leaves to develop yellow spots.
