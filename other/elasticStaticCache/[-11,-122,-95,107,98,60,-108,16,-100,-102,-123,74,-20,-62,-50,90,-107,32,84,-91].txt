on the leaves moderately available, primarily in ball and burlap form young trees that have been root-pruned (i.e., transplanted in a balled and burlaped state) should be regulary watered for at least three years following transplanting Tuliptree is extremely sensitive to being transplanted in the Autumn (a general characteristic of fleshy-rooted and coarsely-rooted woody plants), and extra care

drought conditions) one of the best trees for yellow to \ngolden-yellow fall color F lowers large, solitary, showy flowers have six yellow-green petals surrounded by three green sepals and resemble a huge tulip (hence the common name) interior of the flower contains a bright orange and yellow corolla, surrounding the central spire of immature aggregate fruits flowering in late May and throughout

brown tones of maturity, with interlacing ridges that are contrasted with deep furrows on the straight trunks the olive to off-white-colored wood can be used as pulp for paper production, but is often
