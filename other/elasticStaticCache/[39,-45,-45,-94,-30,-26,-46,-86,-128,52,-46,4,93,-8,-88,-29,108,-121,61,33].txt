DRAFT April 10, 2014 177 Lesson 4. Wind’s Temperature Wind Speed and Wind Direction Duration : 4 days Background Information Measuring and Recording Speed and Direction of the wind Weathermen gather information about the speed and direction of the wind. They do this to predict weather. They use instruments to measure the speed and direction of the wind. Wind speed is measured by an anemometer. The wind speed is shown by the number of circles or revolutions the anemometer makes in one minute. At times the anemometer almost does not move. We say that the wind is calm. A slow wind will move the anemometer a little. A moderate wind can turn the cups of the anemometer. At times the anemometer can make several circles or revolutions. We say that the wind is strong or fast. Some anemometers have a device that measures the speed of the wind. This can be used to name the wind. The wind vane is an instrument with an arrowhead and a tail. The wind pushes the tail. The arrowhead points toward the direction from which the wind comes. Winds are always described according to the direction from which they are blowing. As the wind strikes the tail of the wind vane, the wind vane turns so that the arrow points in the directions from which the wind is blowing Name Speed (km/hr) Calm 0-1 Light Air 1-5 Light Breeze 6-11 Gentle Breeze 12-19 Moderate Breeze 20-28",1.311052918434143],["Classroom Weather: Describe The learner will be able to describe weather by temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation.",1.304831862449646],["Classroom Weather: Describe The learner will be able to describe weather by temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation.",1.304831862449646],["Wind is used to describe the prevailing direction from which the wind is blowing with the speed given usually in miles per hour or knots.",1.3001213073730469],["Wind is used to describe the prevailing direction from which the wind is blowing with the speed given usually in miles per hour or knots.",1.3001213073730469],["Wind is used to describe the prevailing direction from which the wind is blowing with the speed given usually in miles per hour or knots.",1.3001213073730469],["Investigating Weather (Earth and Space Science) Students use their senses and tools, such as thermometers, rain gauges and wind speed indicators, to describe the weather conditions around them.",1.2972080707550049],["Investigating Weather (Earth and Space Science) Students use their senses and tools, such as thermometers, rain gauges and wind speed indicators, to describe the weather conditions around them.",1.2972080707550049],["The station model plotted on surface weather maps uses a wind barb to show both wind direction and speed.
