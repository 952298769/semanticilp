sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future

down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain

actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we

Read this information from the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine: Here is but a small sample of the articles: World leaders gathered in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 to consider a world treaty restricting emissions of ''greenhouse gases,'' chiefly carbon dioxide (CO2), that are thought to cause ''global warming'' severe increases in Earth's atmospheric and surface temperatures, with disastrous environmental consequences.",0.543876588344574],["Without these gases the earth would be uninhabitable - at least by humans.",0.5437259674072266],["Inverse modeling has been applied to a broad range of environmental problems, for example inferring sources and sinks of long-lived trace gases in the Earth s atmosphere.",0.5433582067489624],["ALL of these statements about terrestrial and lunar atmospheres are TRUE, EXCEPT ONE: A. assuming there's a source of atmospheric gases, stronger surface gravity will help keep them B. assuming there's a source of atmospheric gases, nearness to the sun will help keep them C. the fact that Triton's volcanic soot trails all run in the same direction strongly suggests that moon has (or once had) an atmosphere: the volcanoes themselves could have been the sources of that atmosphere D. atmospheres are and have been major 'processors' of the surfaces of at least 3 terrestrial planets E. if earth had no atmosphere, our daytime sky would not be azure blue 11.",0.5432096123695374],["The increase in greenhouse gases from human sources has been measured and is known with some certainty, but there remain areas of uncertainty, including whether an increase in atmospheric water vapor and clouds would tend to increase or decrease climate warming.",0.542833685874939],["First, there is the uncertainty about the amount of climate change that might result from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere.",0.5418848991394043],["The Measurements of Anthropogenic Gases and Natural Emissions from Tall Towers (MAGNETT) program of NOAA/CMDL utilizes existing tall (&gt;400 m) towers as sampling platforms for in-situ and flask sample analyses of atmospheric trace gases.",0.54087895154953],["OTHER ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDS Toxic gases and vapors come from a wide variety of sources.",0.5399352312088013],["Human activity is moving the carbon in oil, coal, and natural gas from below ground to the earth's surface and atmosphere, making it available for use by living things.",0.53913813829422],["The atmosphere is made up of gases around the Earth (where we live).",0.5377870202064514],["Human Activity is causing some greenhouse gases to be increasing in the earth's atmosphere, some examples include: Greenhouse Gases: CO 2 CH 4 CFC Rate of Annual Accumulation in the Atmosphere: 0.5% 0.9% The main CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels (the largest source) and tropical deforestation (much smaller source).",0.5363421440124512],["Human Activity is causing some greenhouse gases to be increasing in the earth's atmosphere, some examples include: Greenhouse Gases: CO 2 CH 4 CFC Rate of Annual Accumulation in the Atmosphere: 0.5% 0.9% The main CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels (the largest source) and tropical deforestation (much smaller source).",0.5363421440124512],["Venus, Earth, and Mars all developed a CO 2 - and H 2 O-rich atmosphere first Venus and Earth still have relatively dense atmospheres, and Mars doesn't, primarily because the latter lost its volcanic source of atmospheric gases If Venus had always been at earth's distance from the sun instead of where it is now, it most likely would have retained its CO 2 -rich atmosphere to the present day Water in liquid form is apparently responsible for our losing the originally high concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere If earth had the mass and size of Mars instead of our actual mass and size, our atmosphere would likely be thinner (less dense and far less substantial) than it really is Ain't no doubt about it.",0.5350501537322998],["It is often noted that, without an atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the surface temperature of the Earth from solar irradiation would be about 250 K or 40 degrees Centigrade colder than what we now enjoy.",0.5346819162368774],["The globally averaged surface temperature record from IPCC 1995 shows an increase of about 0.5 C between 1910 and 1940, before most of the greenhouse gases from human activities entered the atmosphere.",0.5344294905662537],["Were it not for the existence of greenhouse gases, which occur in minute amounts throughout the atmosphere, the earth&#146;s average temperature would be &#150;18 o C.",0.5306259989738464],["source of many atmospheric gases.",0.5279301404953003]]
