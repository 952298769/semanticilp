is pumped and it accumulates in the veins and causes swelling (edema) of many tissues (dropsy) eventually the patient dies from congestive heart failure Withering investigated foxglove for 10 years made many different preparations from the plant: dried, water extracts, alcohol extracts made careful quantitative tests of the proper dosage- high doses are quite poisonous studied and tried to eliminate side effects of the drug published his results in 1785 (An Account of the Foxglove) Although Withering did not discover foxglove his careful observations made it useful in medicine Digitalis
