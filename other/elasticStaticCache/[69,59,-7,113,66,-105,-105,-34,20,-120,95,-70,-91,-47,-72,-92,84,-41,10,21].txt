Consider for example a tremendous athlete. Having athletic ability can be genetic, which is why parents who are athletic are more likely to have athletic kids. However, becoming really good at soccer is a learned activity. Athleticism will help a person become good at soccer more quickly and easily, but learning to play soccer itself is a learned trait. Another commonly mistaken example is the language that you speak. Often kids assume that the language you speak is inherited when in reality it is the result of what your parents teach you.
