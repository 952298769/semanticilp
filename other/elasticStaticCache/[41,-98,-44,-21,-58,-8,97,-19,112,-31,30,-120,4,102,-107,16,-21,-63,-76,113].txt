Nature of weathering and erosion A. Weathering weathering is simply the chemical and/or physical breakdown of a rock material--weathering involves specific processes acting on rock materials at or near the surface of the Earth B. Erosion is the removal or transportation of material by agents as running water, ice, wind, etc. different degrees of weathering in rocks and erosion work together to form some interesting landforms such as Bryce Canyon, National Park, Utah click here to see Bryce Canyon II.",1.0816408395767212]]
