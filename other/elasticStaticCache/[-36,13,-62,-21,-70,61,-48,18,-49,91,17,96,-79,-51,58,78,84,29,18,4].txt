disintegration or fragmentation of rocks involving no change in the mineralogical composition of the rocks 2) Chemical Weathering - decomposition of rock involving a chemical change in the minerals 5 Page 6 WEATHERING AND SOILS WEATHERING PROCESSES Mechanical Weathering - breaks rock into smaller fragments that retain the characteristics of the original rock - do not change the mineralogical composition of the rock - exposes more surface area (increases the surface area to volume ratio) of rock for subsequent chemical attack 6 Page 7 WEATHERING AND SOILS MECHANICAL WEATHERING PROCESSES 1) FROST ACTION -
