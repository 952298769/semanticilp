There are some disease organisms and insects that will attack African violets; the best method for dealing with them is prevention. Where good sanitation practices are observed where violets are grown there will be little necessity for a spray program. Pests and diseases can be brought into the home on hands and clothing from the garden, from cut flowers or from newly purchased plants. Although the area surrounding violets need not be hospital sterile, their method of clean hands, clean clothes and clean utensils is a good pattern to follow. New plants, even if they are gifts from friends, should be isolated from other violets for at least two months. They should be watched for problems and treated if something occurs. Old blossoms and leaves must be removed at once. Sometimes if a certain plant begins to look strange it would be better to destroy it. This will help to prevent a disease or insect from spreading to an entire collection. In the long run it is cheaper. There are many chemical sprays on the market today but most of them are not available to the home hobbyist. But if a spray program is indicated then only those chemicals recommended for use on African violets should be considered and all information and precautions printed on the package should be followed to the letter. This information is there for the protection of the plants and the user. Spraying should never be done in areas where one sleeps or eats. The room must be well ventilated during the spraying process and immediately following it. It is preferable to do it out of doors. NEVER remain in the area after the spraying is completed; leave it at once! Rubber gloves should be worn as well as protective clothing and a mask. Hands and all exposed skin should be washed with soap and water immediately following the use of pesticides. In storing these chemicals be sure they are out of the reach of children and that they are marked “POISON”. Do not leave any spray solution in the sprayer; empty it at once and rinse it well before storing it away. All of this information is just the beginning. The real enjoyment in this hobby is the studying, the learning and the experimenting.  The African Violet Magazine is the best source for new knowledge but the Handbook for Judges and Exhibitors which is available at the AVSA Office is another helpful source of information.",0.9059014320373535],["Using these insecticides, particularly Pyrethroids, would guarantee more late season chemical sprays to
