and living things convert stored energy to motion and heat 1.4 energy can be carried from one place to another by waves, such as water waves and sound, by electric current, and by moving objects 1.5 matter has three forms: solid, liquid, and gas 1.6 evaporation and melting are changes that occur when objects are heated 1.7 when two or more substances are combined a new substance may be formed
