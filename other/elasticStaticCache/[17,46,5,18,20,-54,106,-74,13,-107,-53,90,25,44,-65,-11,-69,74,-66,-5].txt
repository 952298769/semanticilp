For example, animal species that live in cold environments may have adaptive traits that help them survive and reproduce under those conditions, such as thick fur or antifreeze in their blood. Animals may also have adaptive behaviors that help them deal with the environment, such as storing food for periods when it is scarce, or hibernating during times of the year where conditions are most unfavorable. These adaptations are usually consistently seen in all individuals within a species. However, sometimes populations of the same species may be exposed to different conditions depending on where they live. The idea that populations of the same species have evolved as a result of certain aspects of their environment is called local adaptation.",1.5343291759490967],["If an animal lives in an area where the winter is mild, it may hibernate only briefly, or not at all.

While in hibernation mode, and animal’s body temperature drops and most bodily functions are significantly slowed. Hibernation allows an animal to live through periods of extreme cold when food supplies are few or nonexistent. Groundhogs, unlike bears, enter true hibernation, and the core temperature of a groundhog can get below thirty two degrees Fahrenheit! This cold temperature cannot be held indefinitely, and so every hibernating animal wakes up periodically to move and reestablish body temperature. It used to be assumed that an animal’s metabolism decrease was due to the fact that body temperature was the first function to lessen during hibernation. Scientists recently discovered it is the slowing of the metabolism that decreases the temperature and not the other way around. This discovery proved that hibernation was an involuntary, internal mechanism and not one induced by the decrease in environmental temperatures.",1.3711017370224],["Hibernating means to pass the winter in a dormant or lethargic state. Animals that hibernate store body fat when food is plentiful. When food is scarce, they hibernate, living off their stored body fat. Deep hibernation, or winter sleep, generally occurs in smaller mammals. In deep hibernation, an animal's body temperature can drop to a few degrees above freezing for a period of days or weeks.

Prior to that time, they can put on up to 14 kg (30 lb) of body fat to get them through the several months during which they fast. Hibernation in black bears typically lasts 3–8 months, depending on regional climate. [18] [64] During this time, their heart rate drops from 40–50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute and metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of a bear’s (non-hibernating) basal metabolic rate (BMR). Many of the physiological changes a bear exhibits during hibernation are retained slightly post-hibernation. Upon exiting hibernation, bears retain a reduced heart rate and basal metabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a hibernating bear will remain at a reduced level for up to 21 days after hibernation. [65] Reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation. [66] They spend their time in hollowed-out dens in tree cavities, under logs or rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions. Females, however, have been shown to be pickier in their choice of dens, in comparison to males. [67] Although naturally-made dens are occasionally used, most dens are dug out by the bear itself. [54] The hibernating American black bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity, due to ailment or old age. [68] [69] A hibernating black bear loses approximately half the muscular strength to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear’s bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, this implies that the bear’s conservation of bone mass during hibernation is due to a biological mechanism. [70] During hibernation bears retain all excretory waste, and a special hormone, leptin is released into the black bear's systems, to suppress appetite.The retention of waste during hibernation (specifically in minerals such as calcium) may play a role in the bear’s resistance to atrophy. [68] The body temperature of the American black bear does not drop significantly, like other mammalian hibernators (staying around 35 degrees Celsius) and they remain somewhat alert and active. If the winter is mild enough, they may wake up and forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts. [71] During winter, black bears consume 25–40% of their body weight. [72] The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue. In the southernmost areas (i.e. Florida, Mexico, the Southeastern United States ) of the black bear's distribution, only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation. [5] The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear's success in captivity. [73] After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity. In mountainous areas, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses. Black bears use dense cover for hiding and thermal protection, as well as for bedding.",1.2497633695602417]]
