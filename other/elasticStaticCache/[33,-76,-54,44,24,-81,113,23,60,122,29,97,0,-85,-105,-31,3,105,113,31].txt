[["and whereas none of us know of a region in the lower Great Lakes or St Lawrence basin where Chorus Frog populations can safely be regarded as stable, and whereas urbanization, intensified agriculture (especially tile drainage and nitrate-rich runoff), and the return of forests by secondary succession have been shown to eliminate Chorus Frog populations, and various forms of habitat fragmentation are thought to contribute to these extinctions, and whereas the habitat of Chorus Frogs seems like the ideal place for People to establish new buildings and facilities in which to live and work, while increasing human residences, industry, traffic, and services fundamentally change the landscape in ways that often lead to the decline of Chorus Frogs and other middle landscape species, and whereas : in Ontario, at least, the property tax system does not allow rebates or other incentives to landowners who maintain diversity on middle landscape habitats such as the small wetlands, wet fields, and ditches used by the Chorus Frog, and whereas, herpetologists have listened to the calls of Chorus Frogs in the spring, without knowing much about larval life, or anything about the non-breeding life of adults or juveniles, or interactions with other species, and whereas, while we fear declines, in many areas these are inadequately documented, and we know little about rates of recolonization at sites where Chorus Frogs have once ceased to call We, the First International Conference on Northeastern Pseudacris triseriata , assembled in Kemptville, Grenville County, Ontario, on 4 March 2001: declare Chorus Frogs a totem of early spring and the middle landscape, whose abundance signifies all that is best about rural land use patterns of 19th and 20th century agricultural settlement around the Great Lakes and in the St Lawrence drainage, and a totem of the Prairie Peninsula/hypsithermal history of this region, and of the vulnerability of biotic diversity in settled landscapes... express our profound unease about the species' prospects in this area in coming decades... commend the governments of Vermont, Quebec, and New York for assigning Endangered,' Vulnerable' and Restricted' status to the species in their jurisdictions... commend the government of Quebec for its support of ongoing monitoring and life history studies of Chorus Frogs... commend the United States Geological Survey for supporting resurveys of sites in New York where Chorus Frogs were inventoried in the 1970s... urge our herpetological colleagues, naturalists, and the general public to keep these known and suspected declines in mind when thinking about the impact of human activities on diversity... and urge governments and municipal planners to recognize Chorus Frogs as a conspicuous species which will continue to thrive in a truely rural landscape, to monitor Chorus Frog populations, and to modify land use plans, zoning, and taxation to accommodate the requirements of Chorus Frogs as these become evident, in order to preserve the rural character of settled areas.",1.433605670928955],["X1011758073-00097-30794</DOCNO> Endangered Frogs Slide 10 of 48 Endangered Frogs
