Mountains can also be formed by the buildup of igneous rock from volcanoes. Volcanic mountains are formed either through the introduction and accumulation of magma over a crustal \"hot spot\" or through volcanic activity associated with the collision and subduction of a crustal plate, where the melting of the subducted crust creates magma, gases and pressures that are released in eruptions. Continental crustal plate collisions, where neither plate subducts, create mountain ranges such as The Himalayan Mountain Range, where crustal material is thrust upward faster than erosion can wear it down. Plates can stretch until they crack and slide, forming fault-block mountains.
