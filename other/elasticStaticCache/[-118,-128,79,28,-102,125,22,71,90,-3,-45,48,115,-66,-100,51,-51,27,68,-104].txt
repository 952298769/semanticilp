nature of many streams in the Ozarks--a hot spring is about 10-15 degrees F warmer than the mean annual air temperature in the locality it occurs and is warmer because of an association of the groundwater with a hot igneous intrusion prior to emission click here to see Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park a spring can be related to a perched water table--this arises when there is groundwater located in the zone of aeration above the main or regional water table click here to see a perched water table a geyser is a hot spring which is ejected at the surface with great force
