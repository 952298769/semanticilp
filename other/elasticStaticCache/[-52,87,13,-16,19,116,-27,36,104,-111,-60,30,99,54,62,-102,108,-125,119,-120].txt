chemicals at least once a year Indicate in the inventory where chemicals are located Update inventory when chemicals are purchased or used up Purchase chemicals in smallest quantities needed If trying out a new procedure try to obtain the chemicals needed from another laboratory or purchase small amounts initially After you know you will be using more of these chemicals purchase in larger
