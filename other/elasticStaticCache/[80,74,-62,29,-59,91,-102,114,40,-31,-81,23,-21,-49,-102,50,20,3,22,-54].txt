They can change not only their coloring, but also the texture of their skin to match rocks, corals and other items nearby. They do this by controlling the size of projections on their skin (called papillae), creating textures ranging from small bumps to tall spikes. The result is a disguise that makes them nearly invisible; can you even see the octopus in the video above? Color changing is just one tool in an octopus’s arsenal of defenses, however; it can also spray ink, and make a quick escape through any hole it can get its hidden bony beak through.",0.9078505635261536],["If these tactics do not work, and there is no shelter available, the octopus can release a cloud of black ink.",0.8995562195777893],["Here, they hide from predators and seek shelter from bad weather.",0.8106163144111633],["Trees and shrubs provide shelter from storms and hiding places from predators.",0.8106163144111633],["They find shelter in trees or dense grass around water where their camouflaged colors aid them in hiding from predators such as garter snakes or birds.",0.8024439811706543],["One of the primary reasons snakes seek shelter is to hide from potential predators.",0.7916802167892456],["Hiding away from predators is a big goal in shelter for cheetahs.",0.7916802167892456],["(b) A hiding place or vegetative shelter for wildlife from predators or inclement weather.",0.7916802167892456],["Hiding Cover A component of habitat that provides animals with shelter from predators.",0.7916802167892456],["SHELTER Salmon stay under wood to be in the shade and to hide from predators.",0.7916802167892456],["Shelter Birds need places where they can hide from predators",0.7916802167892456],["(b) A hiding place or vegetative shelter for wildlife from predators or inclement weather.",0.7916802167892456],["(b) A hiding place or vegetative shelter for wildlife from predators or inclement weather.",0.7916802167892456],["(b) a hiding place or vegetative shelter for wildlife from predators or inclement weather.",0.7916802167892456],["SHELTER: Birds need cover for nesting and to rest and hide from predators.",0.7916802167892456],["Hiding Cover A component of habitat that provides animals with shelter from predators.",0.7916802167892456],["Creating homes and hiding places for organisms seeking refuge from predation (for example, polychaete worms and soft-shell blue crabs)",0.7813189029693604],["Creating homes and hiding places for organisms seeking refuge from predation (for example, polychaete worms and soft-shell blue crabs)",0.7813189029693604],["For example, the pneumataphores of the Black Mangrove provide safety for many marine animals, sheltering crabs, shrimp, fish and clams, protecting many from predators.",0.7413107752799988],["Ink jet printers create images by squirting colored inks onto paper.",0.7377883195877075],["Ink jet printers create images by squirting colored inks onto paper.",0.7377883195877075],["Ink jet printers create images by squirting colored inks onto paper.",0.7377883195877075],["Shelter Birds need shelter to protect them from the elements and allow them to hide from predators.",0.7298418283462524],["Shelter Birds need shelter to protect them from the elements and allow them to hide from predators.",0.7298418283462524],["A place around the octopuses' shelter that is scattered with their \"belongings\"",0.7289867401123047],["A place around the octopuses' shelter that is scattered with their \"belongings\"",0.7289867401123047],["Evergreens provide shelter from wind and/or predators (predators can also hide in them, lurking for prey) and are interesting winter accents.",0.7276509404182434],["The printers create an image by squirting tiny droplets of ink in a pattern so fine that the dots \nare invisible from a few inches away.",0.7276026010513306],["The printers create an image by squirting tiny droplets of ink in a pattern so fine that the dots are invisible from a few inches away.",0.7276026010513306],["Like its close relatives, the squid and octopus, the cuttlefish is equipped with an ink sac that can help it make a last-ditch escape from predators that hunt by sight.
