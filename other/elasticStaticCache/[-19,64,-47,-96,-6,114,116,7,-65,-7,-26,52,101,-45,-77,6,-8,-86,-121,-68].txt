remain ready in case the same virus invades again Immunity = state of being resistant to a specific disease Acquired immunity -any form of immunity that is not innate ( present at birth ) but is

attack of an infectious substance Artificial passive immunity -acquired by receiving antiserum containing antibodies from another host Acquired active immunity -artificially acquired immunity through vaccination or immunization Better health usually means that ones immune system can respond effectively disease usually strikes when the immune system is compromised health can be compromised by: l-Age -older individuals are usually more susceptible to new diseases even though they may have a large amount of acquired immunity 2-Heredity -genes and genetic disorders can effect the immune systems ability to respond 3-Disease can cause one to become more susceptible to other diseases (AIDS) 4- Bad habits such as smoking which leads to diseased lungs Macrophage -phagocytic cells which protects the body by ingesting invading cells and interacting with other immune system cells Histiocytes -large macrophages found loose in connective tissue Immunoglobulins each contain a constant region of amino acids which is always set -but not identical among all antibodies each immunoglobulin also contains a variable region- where the amino acid sequence Varies between antibodies -they

bearing cells Contain storage vacuoles -contain perforin = perforate plasma membrane - Allowing water and salts to enter and cause the cell to burst Helper T cells -regulate immunity by enhancing response of other immune cells Upon antigen exposure -they enlarge and secrete cytokines -stimulate Molecules that cause helper T cells to divide and other immune cells to perform their function H1V infects helper T cells -to inactivate the immune system \nActivation of T cells When T cells leave the thymus they have receptors but cannot recognize the antigen by Themselves The antigen is presented to them by APC -antigen presenting cells -usually macrophages Which engulf and break down pathogens to fragments within an endocytic vesicle the fragments are linked to a major histocompatability complex (MHC) protein in the plasma Membrane that can be presented to a T cell Human MHC proteins are called fILA (human leukocyte associated) antigens -b/c they mark the cell as belonging to a particular individual -fILA are self antigens membrane attack complex: -Lysis is the destruction of a cell by penetrating the cell wall and allowing fluid to fill the cell, eventually causing the cell to rupture Interferon -family of proteins released by cells when invaded by a virus -signals noninfected cells to form an antiviral protein to stop or slow viral multiplication -interferon is species specific therefore only human interferon can be used in humans Specific Defenses: antigen -any foreign substance that stimulates the immune system to react to it Immune system is able of distinguishing self from nonself immunity can last for a long time -Immunity is the result of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes B lymphocytes mature in the red bone marrow Give rise to plasma cells which produce antibodies -which are proteins capable Of combining and neutralizing antigens -the antibodies are secreted into the blood, lymph, and other body fluids T lymphocytes ( T cells )produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus coordinate immune defenses and kill organisms which necessary Helper T cells -secrete substances that stimulate the production of antibodies by B cells Suppressor T cells -stop B cell activity when no longer needed Memory T cells -remembers specific antigens for the stimulation of a faster and more intense response if the antigen appears later Lymphokines -chemicals produced by the T cells -are signals between the cells of the immune system to attract macrophages and prepare them to attack lymphocytes recognize antigens because they have receptors molecules on their surface the shape of the reseptors on any given lymphocyte is complementary to a specific antigen -the antigen and receptor fit like a &quot;lock and key&quot; Their is a
