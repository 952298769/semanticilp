RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",0.9539781808853149],["One good example of adaptation is the camel and its ability to survive for long periods of time in the desert with very little water.",0.9470508694648743],["They eat cactus fruit and desert grasses and because of their environment, God has given them adaptations to be able to survive without water.",0.9241493940353394],["The stems of most cacti have adaptations to allow them to conduct photosynthesis in the absence of leaves.",0.9138821363449097],["A miracle of adaptation to the adversities of the arid desert, cactus also can survive the assaults of life in our homes: dry air and less than ideal conditions.",0.9130414128303528],["This subfamily is probably the most evolved with special adaptations for survival in very dry conditions, with many described as xerophytes.",0.8765901923179626],["6-10, Ricklefs] Former (C 4 ) cycle goes on at night, when cooler temperature minimizes problems of water loss, and accumulates carbon in form of malate Latter (C 3 ) cycle obviously must go on in daytime, when sunlight is available to power the Calvin cycle Plants close stomates in daytime to minimize water loss, and used the stored carbon (malate) to drive Calvin cycle This photosynthetic mechanism termed CAM after Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, first discovered in plants in stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) Some desert succulent plants, such as cacti, are examples of CAM plants Animal adaptations to hot, dry environments What are some different kinds of adaptations?",0.8737096190452576],["They can survive without water for nine to ten months because their kidneys prevent water loss from urination – an adaptation to desert habitats.",0.8568727970123291],["Considering that this is a desert species, soaking in water seems inconsistent with adaptations to arid conditions and could lead to respiratory infections if the animal does not thoroughly dry after soaking.",0.8519700169563293],["Considering that this is a desert species, soaking in water seems inconsistent with adaptations to arid conditions and could lead to respiratory infections if the animal does not thoroughly dry after soaking.",0.8519700169563293],["The flora are adapted to extremely hot and dry conditions, but generally not as extreme as the adaptations needed for survival in the flora of the Sonoran Desert, which has an overlap in its major flora, such as the creosote bush (\"Larrea tridentata\").",0.8499040007591248],["What are the alternative types of adaptation to dry conditions?",0.8455950021743774],["Which of the following is NOT an adaptation of the flowering plants to very dry, desert-like conditions?",0.8405751585960388],["Desert plants exhibit adaptations in form and function to very dry conditions.",0.8405751585960388],["Numerous complexes of adaptations for performing life functions is required for any organism to exist, survive, adapt and evolve, via speciation processes, into new and different kinds capable of surviving an every changing environment - read about carnivorous plants , an unusual form of adaptation, and desert plants , and adaptation to hot and dry conditions C.",0.840091347694397],["Another example of cacti adaptation occurs way south in southern Argentina where Opuntia australis not only survives the cold dry weather but also copes with abrasive winds and the highest level of salinity in which any plant in the Plant Kingdon lives.",0.8291164636611938],["Copyright&#169;
