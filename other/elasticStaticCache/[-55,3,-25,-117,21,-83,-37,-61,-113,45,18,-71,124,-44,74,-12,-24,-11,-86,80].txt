Pesticides have been used for insect control in the Arctic PCBs are still around in buildings and landfills Abandoned military sites are local PCB sources Power stations, oil platforms, mines, and trains are potential PCB sources Arctic smelters and pulp mills have contributed dioxins Levels in the air, snow, and rain Air measurements point to mid-latitude POP-use as source to the Arctic
