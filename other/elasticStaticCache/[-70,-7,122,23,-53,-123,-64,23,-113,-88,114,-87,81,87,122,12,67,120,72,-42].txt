The key difference is that in the basidiomycetes, a nascent, hypogeal reproductive fruiting body called the primordium is formed by the mycelium. It is only at the point of reproductive imminence that meiosis occurs; four club-shaped basidia are produced at the end of selected hyphae so that each of the four haploid spores will be separately housed and ready for dispersal (note that some basidiomycetes, such as Agaricus bisporus, have only two spores but these are exceptions). Fungi thus spend almost all of their lives as haploids contrasted to animals and plants that live almost wholly as diploids The spore producing surface is called the hymenium; for gilled mushrooms it is on both sides of the adjacent gills, for mushrooms with pores, it is the surface of the vertical tubes. The fully formed hypogeal mushroom primordium is now reproductively and physiologically ready to break the surface of the ground and open to expose its spore laden gills to the winds of chance dispersion.

When we first discussed Alternation of Generations, we looked at a very simple diagram in which adults produced 1n gametes by meiosis, and those gametes joined by syngamy to form a new 2n generation. In reality in algae and plants, there are a few more stages in the process, thus we now need to revisit this cycle. The 2n generation, which in humans is called an _adult,_ in algae and plants is called a sporophyte because it produces spores. Within specialized reproductive structures in/on the bodies of the sporophyte, meiosis occurs to reduce the chromosome number from 2n to 1n, thus the spores which are produced are 1n. What is very significant, here, is that meiosis produces 1n spores, not gametes. Each spore germinates and grows into a new, independent, 1n organism (which often looks totally different than the 2n generation). These 1n organisms are called gametophytes because they produce the gametes (eggs and sperm), which are still 1n. Then, as we_ve seen in the past, an egg and sperm unite by syngamy (fertilization) increasing the chromosome number from 1n to 2n, and forming a zygote which is 2n. The zygote grows into the sporophyte, and the cycle starts over. Various of the green algae go through this cycle as do members of the next two groups, the brown and red algae. Plants also go through this same cycle with some interesting modifications we will discuss later.",1.0646532773971558],["Germinating Seeds - Interested in plant life?",1.0601532459259033],["Plants can make their own food through a process called Photosynthesis, which is the conversion of light into food for plants.",1.0593677759170532],["An at- planting insecticide should not be necessary for two reasons: 1) these are not favored food sources and 2) the high plant population and ability for these crops to compensate should make up for stand loss which may occur.",1.0592432022094727]]
