============================ The Spiny-tailed iguanas tend to be nasty and not tameable like their bigger, green iguana (Iguana iguana) cousins Most find that their adult spiny iguanas do best on a primarily herbivorous diet, similar to the Uromastyx in captivity (95% plant matter, 5% animal matter) Plant matter can include the Green Iguana Salad (see my Iguana Care and Socialization document
