A deer may live in a forest, and because the forest surrounds the deer, this makes that forest that deer's environment. Environmental science, environmentalism, and ecology are al different things. Environmentalism is a movement in society that is dedicated to defending the Earth's life support systems, to keep them safe for the future, whereas environmental science is a study that covers many fields on how humans interact with both living and nonliving things. Ecology is sort of like this, but the study is looser and more Biology-oriented; it's directed more towards organisms and how they interact with each other and with the environment in which they live, which is typically nonliving. Organisms and species differ in that \"organism\" is an all-encompassing term for a living thing, and species are specific subcategories within being an organism. They have distinctive traits, and, in the event that they have reproductive organs specifically for making more of their species, can produce fertile offspring. These are found in ecosystems: sets of organisms interacting with each other and their nonliving environment, energy is within Ecosystems as well. Sustainability is the ability of a system, be it natural, economical, or cultural, to adapt to changing environments indefinitely. Natural capital is defined as the natural resources and services that keep people and other lifeforms and their economies alive. Resources found in nature (Natural resources) are materials and energy found in nature that have a serviceable or necessary purpose to humans. Natural services are like these, save for that they are functions instead of objects. These services support human life and human economies. Now that we know about natural capital, we can learn about what supports it: solar capital. Solar capital is energy from the sun, basic as it gets. These natural resources, sans the solar one, are being overused by us humans, in a process known as natural capital degradation. What this means for the Earth is that we are using its replenishable resources faster than it can replenish them. Nutrient cycling is a natural service performed by nature, it is the process of recycling chemicals that organisms need from their environments through a series of organisms and back into the environment. This activity is extremely important! Without it, ecosystems would be collapsing all over the place form lack of these necessary chemicals. The golden apples, the grand prize of Sustainability is an environmentally sustainable society. Such a society would justly and equitably meet the needs of its people, both present and future, as well as have the ability to provide those future generations with their basic needs.

Cyanobacteria utilize the energy of sunlight to drive photosynthesis, a process where the energy of light is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. While most of the high-energy electrons derived from water are utilized by the cyanobacterial cells for their own needs, a fraction of these electrons are donated to the external environment via electrogenic activity. Cyanobacterial electrogenic activity is an important microbiological conduit of solar energy into the biosphere.",1.321336269378662],["This course will examine the impact of human activities upon the natural environment, focusing on the ways in which our urban industrial culture uses and changes the natural environment, and thus affects human health and well-being.",1.3211653232574463],["social environments affected by the natural barriers to human activity by opportunities for human food, water, energy, and shelter acquisition;",1.3211365938186646],["You Too Can Be PowerSmart M4 - Conservation Potential M5 - Electricity &amp; the Environment: Achieving a Balance 4-7 Ordering Information 4-7 Videos IIE Field Trips Energy Education (Grades 4-7) Module 1: Energy Use &amp; Energy Resources Main Themes Activities Background Info Solar Energy Wind Energy Hydro Energy Biomass Energy Geothermal Energy Energy Efficiency Coal Natural Gas Oil Nuclear Energy Coal Coal is the compressed remains of ancient plants.",1.3204864263534546],["Mechoshade - Energy conserving MechoShades and ElectroShades work in harmony with the dynamic use of glass to improve interior environments with optimum solar protection, greater use of natural light, energy savings and those vitally important outdoor views so beneficial to human personal well-being and productivity.",1.3200773000717163],["The founding editors of this journal explain how IE is ecological in that it \"(1) places human activity-industry in the very broadest sense-in the larger context of the biophysical environment from which we obtain resources and into which we place our wastes, and (2) looks to the natural world for models of highly efficient use of resources, energy and byproducts.",1.317284345626831],["Industrial ecology is ecological in that it (1) places human activity -- industry in the very broadest sense -- in the larger context of the biophysical environment from which we obtain resources and into which we place our wastes, and (2) looks to the natural world for models of highly efficient use of resources, energy and byproducts.",1.317284345626831],["Industrial ecology is ecological in that it (1) places human activity -industry in the very broadest sense -- in the larger context of the biophysical environment from which we obtain resources and into which we place our wastes, and (2) looks to the natural world for models of highly efficient use of resources, energy and by-products.",1.317284345626831],["In certain cases, buildings which already meet high thermal insulation standards can reduce energy demand by up to 60 % by using proper passive solar design, optimised active solar systems for domestic hot water and space heating, improved daylighting and natural cooling and solar/glare control.",1.3160886764526367],["Unlike burning fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and other noxious gases which are linked to health problems, global warming and deforestation, solar directly converts the energy of the sun into energy humans can use without harmful byproducts.",1.3145475387573242],["Unlike burning fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and other noxious gases which are linked to health problems, global warming and deforestation, solar directly converts the energy of the sun into energy humans can use without harmful byproducts.",1.3145475387573242],["SAMPLE ACTIVITY After developing an environmental profile of a place, students would use their knowledge of the forces which shape topography (tectonic forces and erosion) and climate (dispersal of solar energy in the atmosphere and oceans) to explain the characteristics of the local environment.",1.3092539310455322],["Most of the energy generated is used to support daily activity and is dissipated into the environment as heat.",1.3069971799850464],["Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.",1.3004697561264038],["Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.",1.3004697561264038],["\"Most people know that using renewable energy sources like solar power is good for the environment.",1.3004697561264038],["Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning are seen in the context of natural processes and alternative technologies, such as the passive and active uses of solar and wind energies.",1.3004415035247803],["Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning are seen in the context of natural processes and alternative technologies, such as the passive and active uses of solar and wind energies.",1.3004415035247803],["Additionally, when masonry is used as a thermal mass it is a natural partner to passive or active solar energy.",1.3004415035247803],["2 [4] Allow a maximum of 4 credits, allocated as follows: • Allow 1 credit for identifying one human activity that could release chemicals harmful to the environment.
