basis for understanding this concept, students know: 5.1 some changes in the earth are due to slow processes, such as erosion, and some changes are due to rapid processes, such as landslides, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes 5.2 natural processes, including freezing/thawing and growth of roots, cause rocks to break down into smaller pieces 5.3 moving water erodes land forms, reshaping the land by taking away from some places and depositing it as pebbles, sand, silt, and mud in other places (weathering, transport, and deposition) Resources: SCORE Science Website:

of landforms, including their history and processes of origin Landforms : configuration of the land surface taking distinctive forms and produced by natural processes Examples: hill, mountain, valley, plateau, floodplain, cliff, canyons ***Landforms are the surface expression of the lithosphere and owe their development to processes originating from both within and outside the earth s surface Two types of processes that are shaping Earth s surface: Internal (tectonics, volcanic and earthquake activity): INITIAL LANDFORMS Example: Mountains are formed by movement in the earth s crust (tilt fault, folds, volcanic activity ) External (weathering, erosion by running water, wind, waves): SEQUENTIAL LANDFORMS \nExample: Some plains are formed by erosion over long periods of time (streams or glaciers) while others are formed by accumulation of material deposited by water, glaciers, or wind Denudation : total action of all processes whereby the exposed rocks of the continents are worn down
