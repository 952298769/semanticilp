Things in the Surroundings Duration: 3 days Background Information The environment includes everything plus the air, sun, water, weather, and the Earth itself. http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/earth.html Plants are the primary habitat for thousands of other organisms. Animals live in, on, or under plants. They provide shelter and safety for animals. They also provide a place for animals to find other food. On a small scale, plants provide shade, help moderate the temperature, and protect animals from the wind. On a larger scale, such as in rainforests, plants actually change the rainfall patterns over large areas of the earth's surface. In the forest and the grasslands, the roots of plants help hold the soil together. This reduces erosion and helps conserve the soil. Plants also help make soil. Soil is made up of lots of particles of rocks which are broken down into very small pieces. When plants die, their decomposed remains are added to the soil. This helps to make the soil rich with nutrients. Many plants are important sources of products that people use including food, fibers (for cloth), and medicines. They help provide some of our energy needs. In some parts of the world, wood is the primary fuel used by people to cook their meals and heat their homes. Plants, because of their beauty, are important elements of our human world.
