One of the reasons for this is that cultural evolutionary theories often define themselves in opposition to those which claim that genetic inheritance is the only significant inheritance mechanism. Clearly one cannot cast Darwin as a cultural evolutionist in this manner, for he had no notion of genetic inheritance to oppose. Having said this, Darwin did believe that what was learned in one generation could be inherited in later generations. But far from distinguishing cultural inheritance from organic inheritance, Darwin thought that all inheritance should be explained by the transmission of ‘gemmules’. These were understood to be particles produced throughout the body, of a character specific to the body part that produces them. Darwin believed that gemmules then travelled to the gonads, where they were transmitted to offspring in the sex cells. Darwin claimed that gemmules were produced throughout the body in order to explain the inheritance of acquired characteristics. So in one sense Darwin is in alignment with modern cultural evolutionists—he believed that characteristics learned during the life of a parent could be transmitted to offspring. But in another sense Darwin is opposed to modern cultural evolutionists, for rather than distinguishing between different interacting inheritance systems (e.g. cultural and genetic inheritance), Darwin tends to use the transmission of gemmules to explain the inheritance of all types of trait.",1.553814172744751],["The blue is especially fragmented, and the brightest blue is at the bottom, which pulls the eye away from the flower rather than toward it.",1.5186856985092163],["They also have a characteristic white-blue eye ring.",1.5133389234542847],["It is a characteristic, like having brown hair or blue eyes.",1.5133389234542847],["It is a characteristic, like having brown hair or blue eyes.",1.5133389234542847],["It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall.",1.4805593490600586],["She is also shown to be a blonde with blue eyes, rather than having the turquoise hair and black eyes of her book counterpart.",1.4785430431365967],["Contents Haemochromatosis is inherited We inherit characteristics such as blond hair and blue eyes from our parents and, in certain circumstances, we inherit diseases too.",1.4741727113723755],["You have been selected to be an investigator to find out which traits and behaviors are inherited or learned.  Have you ever wondered how babies know how to crawl?   Why some people have brown eyes and others have blue?   Why some people like green peas and others do not?

What gets transmitted from parent to offspring is sets of self-assembly instructions, and these instruction sets have not changed since they were formed.
