to identify the unifying themes of biology - to strive for student MASTERY of these themes - to construct an evolutionary timeline, placing these themes on it, at the points at which each theme evolved - to attempt to make connections, to see the \"big picture\" behind students' four years of study - to conduct an extensive review of biological vocabulary - to ensure that students are able to read, write, research, and present biological information - to remember the JOY of biology Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: - analyze the process of scientific thought as it relates to key discoveries about life - describe the characteristics of Whittaker s five kingdoms &amp; the proposed sixth kingdom - describe ways in which organisms differ from one another - describe ways in which organisms are similar - describe the organic and inorganic components of protoplasm - analyze the metabolic processes characteristic of life - describe the methodologies employed by various organisms to fulfill the basic need of food acquisition - analyze the need for temperature regulation in organisms - describe the inheritance mechanisms characteristic of life forms - analyze the process of genetic code replication during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions - describe the processes involved in the transcription and translation of genetic information in life forms - analyze the evolutionary interrelationships among life forms - describe the minimal structural and functional requirements for a living entity - describe the probable evolutionary development of prokaryotic cells - describe the probable evolutionary development of autotrophic cells - describe the probable evolutionary development of eukaryotic cells - describe the probable evolutionary requirements necessary for multicellularity - establish the sequence of evolutionary progress in terms of geologic time - analyze the process of natural selection - analyze the interrelationships between organisms and their environment - evaluate the consequences of predator/prey relationships on population size - analyze factors that lead to extinction - describe the process of parenting in relation to survival of the species - examine the role of communication in survival of the species - describe factors that lead to the process of speciation Course Requirements: ** There will be two tests \nand a cumulative final examination.",1.036805272102356],["That is because if no ecotype has the niche characteristic, then any ecotype which is inedible to all predators is the one to survive the extinction phase.",1.024861454963684],["Discover where they live, what they eat, how they hide from predators and other survival features.",1.023079752922058],["This ability to hide from predators probably increased their survival rate, and they took the place of many brachiopods.",1.023079752922058],["Fawn survival will be better because there will be more vegetation on the ground and more places to hide from predators.",1.023079752922058],["While no specific predator is known, the yellowfin madtom exhibits cryptic coloration and also hides itself in the daytime, both of which are predator-avoidance strategies.",0.9886636137962341],["This paper discusses specific features of the plants taxonomy, reproduction, and the characteristic glycosides and enzyme complement which serve as a biochemical shield protecting the plant from certain predators but at the same time which can be utilized by a narrow group of herbivores.",0.9709063172340393],["This paper discusses specific features of the plants taxonomy, reproduction, and the characteristic glycosides and enzyme complement which serve as a biochemical shield protecting the plant from certain predators but at the same time which can be utilized by a narrow group of herbivores.",0.9709063172340393],["This paper discusses specific features of the plants taxonomy, reproduction, and the characteristic glycosides and enzyme complement which serve as a biochemical shield protecting the plant from certain predators but at the same time which can be utilized by a narrow group of herbivores.",0.9709063172340393],["T. eques only forages during daylight hours and at night it roosts near the tops of desert shrubs to hide from nocturnal ground predators.",0.960523247718811],["In open deserts where there are few places to hide from the watchful eyes and ears of predators, a little ground thumping is a subtle way to communicate with your fellow species.",0.960523247718811],["The audience, made up of mostly 7th and 8th grader students and their parents, sat spellbound during the feature length movie -
