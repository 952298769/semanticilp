Forms of energy include heat , light , sound , electricity , and chemical energy. Energy and work are measured in the same unitsâ€”foot-pounds, joules, ergs, or some other, depending on the system of measurement being used. When a force acts on a body, the work performed (and the energy expended) is the product of the force and the distance over which it is exerted. Potential and Kinetic Energy Potential energy is the capacity for doing work that a body possesses because of its position or condition. For example, a stone resting on the edge of a cliff has potential energy due to its position in the earth's gravitational field. If it falls, the force of gravity (which is equal to the stone's weight; see gravitation ) will act on it until it strikes the ground; the stone's potential energy is equal to its weight times the distance it can fall. A charge in an electric field also has potential energy because of its position; a stretched spring has potential energy because of its condition. Chemical energy is a special kind of potential energy; it is the form of energy involved in chemical reactions. The chemical energy of a substance is due to the condition of the atoms of which it is made; it resides in the chemical bonds that join the atoms in compound substances (see chemical bond ). Kinetic energy is energy a body possesses because it is in motion. The kinetic energy of a body with mass m moving at a velocity v is one half the product of the mass of the body and the square of its velocity, i.e., KE = 1/2 mv2 . Even when a body appears to be at rest, its atoms and molecules are in constant motion and thus have kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules is measured by the temperature of the body. The difference between kinetic energy and potential energy, and the conversion of one to the other, is demonstrated by the falling of a rock from a cliff, when its energy of position is changed to energy of motion. Another example is provided in the movements of a simple pendulum (see harmonic motion ). As the suspended body moves upward in its swing, its kinetic energy is continuously being changed into potential energy; the higher it goes the greater becomes the energy that it owes to its position. At the top of the swing the change from kinetic to potential energy is complete, and in the course of the downward motion that follows the potential energy is in turn converted to kinetic energy. Conversion and Conservation of Energy It is common for energy to be converted from one form to another; however, the law of conservation of energy, a fundamental law of physics, states that although energy can be changed in form it can be neither created nor destroyed (see conservation laws ). The theory of relativity shows, however, that mass and energy are equivalent and thus that one can be converted into the other. As a result, the law of conservation of energy includes both mass and energy. Many transformations of energy are of practical importance. Combustion of fuels results in the conversion of chemical energy into heat and light. In the electric storage battery chemical energy is converted to electrical energy and conversely.

My name is James White. And today we'll be investigating heat transfer. Heat transfer affects our everyday life. For example, it allows our computers to run without burning up. It helps us to design houses that use less energy. It makes cooking food possible. And very importantly, it helps keep us warm or cool, like this radiator. We will look at three different types of heat transfer-- conduction, convection, and radiation, and find examples where they occur around us. To do this we'll use a thermal camera. A thermal camera can see the radiation given off by all objects and use it to measure their temperatures. For example, cold objects normally give off less radiation than hot objects, which give off more radiation. The camera records this radiation and creates a picture. The colors in the picture represent temperatures. Hotter temperatures are lighter colors, and colder temperatures are darker colors. In this picture, my hand is warm. But the copper wire below it is cold. However, the cameras isn't always correct. Let's look at a video of a lighter flame. Although the flame appears to be the same temperature as my hand, it's actually about 2000 degrees Celsius. This is too hot for the video to show us the real temperature. Using the lighter and copper wire, we will observe the first type of heat transfer-- conduction. I'll show you our simple experiment. Conductive heat transfer occurs when there is a temperature difference between two materials in contact with each other. In this case, the right side of the wire is heated by the lighter. At this point, temperature in the material is very high in one area, and cold in other areas. Heat transfers from the high temperature side to the low temperature side. Let's watch as this happens. Over time, the temperature of the material becomes more and more uniform as heat transfer moves energy from hot to cold areas of the wire. When engineering a building, we often care about keeping warm or cold air inside. How well a wall can retain heat in a building depends on two things-- it's thickness and its thermal conductivity. Materials that are thicker will let less heat through. And materials with higher thermal conductivity will let more heat through. How do you think this metal door compares to this foam panel? Which lets through more heat? What about traditional materials like these adobe blocks? When the temperature of a wall or door is different than the surrounding air, a different type of heat transfer begins to occur, named convection. A lighter, a copper wire, and a cardboard backdrop make up our simple experiment. When a material is hotter or cooler than a fluid surrounding it, it causes the fluid to rise or sink. In the case of a hot wire, heated air rises as cold air fills its place. This cools down the wire faster than conduction. If we push the wire towards the cardboard, we see that the hot air rising off the wire heats the cardboard. This hot stream of air is called a convection current, and is part of natural convection. Sometimes natural convection isn't fast enough, so engineers will use forced convection. Your computer uses forced convection to keep itself from overheating. That's what your fans do. Using the thermal camera, we can see that this laptop has several hot components-- here, here, here, and here. When these components get too hot, fans in the laptop will start to pull cool air across the parts. This results in forced convection. The hot air is then blown out the side or back of the computer. Earlier I mentioned that all objects give off radiation. When radiation from a hot object hits another object, it warms it up. This process is called thermal radiation. Two bright lights, a piece of aluminum foil, and a cardboard backdrop make our simple experiment. When the lights are turned on, let's see what happens. We can see that radiation from the lights is absorbed by the cardboard. However, the radiation is reflected by the aluminum foil. When the lights are turned off, we can see that the cardboard under the aluminum foil was not heated because radiation never reached it. The sun is an extremely hot object, and its thermal radiation warms our entire planet. This means that when designing a building, window placement is a very important part of the thermal engineering. When the sun's radiation comes through windows, it will heat up the exposed cooler indoor materials. Conduction and convection then transfer this heat around the building. By considering thermal radiation in design, a building will be warmer during the winter and cooler during the summer. Radiators are a common way to keep buildings in cold environments. Although named a radiator, this device actually uses radiation and convection to transfer its heat to the room. Thermal radiation is sent out in all directions from the radiator and makes you very warm when you stand next to it. Natural convection then circulates the hot air from the radiator around the building. There are so many examples of heat transfer around us every day, and as engineers, we have to think about using them to make the world a better place.
