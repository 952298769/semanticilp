For example, a stove burner converts electrical energy to heat and conducts that energy through the pot to the water. This increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules, causing them to move faster and faster. At a certain temperature (the boiling point), the atoms have gained enough energy to break free of the molecular bonds of the liquid and escape as vapor.",1.0823850631713867],["For procedures which require heating, you can use a microwave (with an appropriate dish) or a small stove-top pan.",1.0777721405029297],["We have all experienced the transfer of heat from a flame to a pan of water and the first law of thermodynamics simply tells us that energy of the flame is used to heat the metal of the pan, heat the water, and even heat some of the surrounding air.",1.0756878852844238],["IF USING A STOVE: Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot uncovered.",1.0755207538604736],["IP \"If Using A \nStove:\" Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot uncovered.",1.0755207538604736],["Here, we use pressurised kerosene stoves as source of heat for boiling and cooking.",1.0755207538604736],["heating water on a gas stove vs on an electric stove) [KC2] measuring various energy changes, eg the temperature change of water as a result of burning a known amount of fuel or using an electric current, or the transfer of energy directly from one system to another.",1.0744783878326416],["The thermometer is further limited by the use of water, which boils and freezes, but as a first attempt to measure temperature it was still pretty nifty.",1.0699505805969238],["Using a large pan, bring the water to a boil.",1.0692944526672363],["When boiling water, always use a cover on the pan.",1.0692944526672363],["Use some of the boiling water to deglaze the roasting pan;",1.0692944526672363],["Use a covered kettle or pan to boil water;",1.0692944526672363],["Use a covered kettle or pan to boil water;",1.0692944526672363],["Use a covered kettle or pan to boil water;",1.0692944526672363],["Using a large pan, bring the water to a boil.",1.0692944526672363],["When boiling water, always use a cover on the pan.",1.0692944526672363],["One example of our use of solar heat energy is for water heating systems.",1.0692110061645508],["After this investigation, for example, students should understand that some of the heat energy used to warm the water was transferred to the water, but also that some of the heat energy was transferred to the room air.",1.0692026615142822],["Another example that could be used to show wave movement would be to fill a 9 x 13 pan up with water.",1.0674443244934082],["Energy is being used to boil water to make the turbines spin.",1.0644994974136353],["Energy is being used to boil water to make the turbines spin.",1.0644994974136353],["Use a vaporizer or breathe steam from a pan of boiled water (after removing it from the heat).",1.0640795230865479],["Nuclear energy is produced by a controlled nuclear chain reaction which creates heat—and which is used to boil water, produce steam, and drive a steam turbine.",1.0633959770202637],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["Instead, use cold tap water and heat it on the stove.",1.063117504119873],["Heat, water and stove use natural gas.",1.063117504119873],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["Heat, water and stove use natural gas.",1.063117504119873],["The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.",1.063117504119873],["The wood stove is used for melting water and heating the yurt.",1.063117504119873]]
