Duncan-Kinard, Tim McPherson, Clyde Ofner, and Suzanne Trump Some key points that were touched on in the discussion: Nicole Duncan-Kinard is very helpful when faculty are just starting out using ERes All of the materials for a course, including the lecture outlines, assignments, sample test items, etc. can be put on Eres This reduces faculty time dealing with course mechanics This is helpful for the students, especially if they missed a class or misplaced a handout Students enjoy having it all available and like using the technology Since it is more costly to print from a computer than to make photocopies, handouts should still be given as paper copies If lectures notes are available on Eres in advance of the class, students can use them as a foundation for their own note taking Attendance drops if all lecture notes, especially detailed notes are available to the students Faculty might need to change teaching strategy, moving away from a need to cover everything in lecture, to concentrating on critical thinking or emphasizing difficult material Journal articles that we have a licensing agreement to post electronically can be put onto the Eres Bulletin boards can be useful for students and faculty to post interesting facts Back to Top T 5 TABLE TALK: TEACHING TIPS AND TECHNIQUES Student Assessment Techniques: Multiple Choices Discussants: Phyllis Blumberg,
