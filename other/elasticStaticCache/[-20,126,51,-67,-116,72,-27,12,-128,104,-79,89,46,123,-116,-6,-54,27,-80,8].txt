only surviving genus of the nautiloids The nautiloids were the largest predators in the seas of the Ordovician period, 450 million years ago Modern Nautiluses are much smaller than their ancient predecessors One Cretaceous species reached a diameter of over 8.2 feet Nautilus is the last living genus of externally shelled cephalopods Very slow moving A relative of the octopus, squid, and cuttlefish Most mature Nautiluses are about 8 inches in diameter Considered primitive when compared to its faster moving relatives Nautiluses have been on the planet for 500 million years and were here before there were bony fish Often captured for their beautiful shell The Nautilus Shell The external shell is produced by mantle tissue Shell is divided into compartments about 4 compartments in newly hatched specimens about 30 in mature individuals The animal occupies the outer-most living chamber As the nautilus grows, its body moves forward in the enlarged shell nad produces a wall to seal off older chambers The larger the animal, the longer it takes to form a compartment The calcium for making new chambers comes from a diet of crabs, eaten shell and all- and the molts of various animals Shell protects and supports the soft body of the mollusc The Nautilus can withdraw completely into the shell and close the opening with the leathery hood The older chambers of the shell contain gas which helps compensate for the weight of the animal's tissues and shell The Nautilus stays neutrally buoyant so that it doesn't sink or float and can move freely in the water Countershading: a form of camouflage coloration upper surface is darkened by irregular stripes the underside blends with the water surface when viewed from below Nautilus Swimming Nautilus swim in a see-saw motion generated by \"jet propulsion\" They alternately pull water into the mantle cavity and blow it out the muscular siphon beneath the tentacles The Nautilus can swim forward, backwards, and sideways Buoyancy mechanism Can travel as far as 150 km per year &#9; A Living Fossil Considered a living fossil because the modern \nshell closely resembles fossils of ancestors living millions
