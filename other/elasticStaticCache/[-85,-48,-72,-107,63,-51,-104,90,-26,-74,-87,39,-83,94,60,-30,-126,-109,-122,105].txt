like mid-latitude cyclones, hurricanes develop around depressions in the pressure surface, but in this case the depression is deeper and spread out over a smaller area - this results in an especially steep slope for the air to descend, thus causing extremely high wind speeds ( in excess of 150 km/hour ) - the high wind speeds in themselves are sufficient reason to obey warnings to leave an area which may be in the path of a hurricane, particularly in view of the fact that one of the lessons learned from Hurricane Andrew ( South Florida, July 1992 ) is that tornadoes are often carried within a hurricane system - tornado winds are strong enough to drive solid objects through solid objects: for a number of years after Hurricane Andrew, a palm tree near Homestead, Florida was observed to have a piece of wood stuck through the centre of its trunk, a trunk which could just as easily have been a human body - another reason to leave the area, particulary a coastal area, is the set-up of water along the coastline by hurricane winds, which results in wave damage and extensive flooding - considerable loss of life has resulted in countries like Bangladesh due to the inability to move large numbers of people away from coastal areas during times of hurricane or, as they are called in that part of the world, cyclones, typhoons and willie willies ( the latter is Australian, mate ) - on October 16, 1954 Hurricane Hazel struck Toronto - actually, it was not a hurricane so much as a reinforced mid-latitude cyclone, a phenomenon which was identified in a recent popular movie The Perfect Storm - Hurricane Hazel had landed along the North Carolina coast and was already in the process of dying, as hurricanes do once they move inland to be cut off from the heat and moisture of the ocean, or as happens when they move toward the cold waters of the Labrador Current, which flows over the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap, off Newfoundland - however, this dying tropical cyclone met up with a vigorous mid-latitude cyclone and, in so doing, found new life as a kind of super mid-latitude storm: Toronto s own version of the perfect storm - it wasn t the wind so much as the rain: within the space of 48 hours, the equivalent of two months of rain had fallen in the Humber River Valley and the Humber River could not handle it - extensive valley flooding literally wiped out people who were settled there, accounting for the loss of 60 lives, far more than were lost in the sinking of the Andrea Gayle, though equally trajic - one of the legacies of that storm has been to discourage settlement of river valley bottom lands in the Toronto area, designating them instead as park and conservation land;",1.530340552330017],["Find out what to do during a heat wave, a lightning storm, a hail storm, a flood, a strong wind storm, a tornado or even a hurricane.",1.4620184898376465],["The most hazardous component of a passing hurricane is the ocean storm surge that can be generated causing flooding and/or wave inundation of oceanfront property.",1.4286500215530396],["X1011783799-00308-71799</DOCNO> Hurricanes Hurricanes Requirements for Hurricane Formation Warm ocean surface Greater than 20 o C Deep layer of warm, moist air Weak or non-existent trade wind inversion Cold air aloft Weak winds throughout air column Allow deep moist air mass to form Minimal shearing of convective cells Source of convergence Remnant of a mid-latitude storm Easterly wave in ITCZ Divergent flow aloft Coriolis force Converging flow must develop rotation Favored locations and seasons In oceanic areas between 10 o and 20 o latitude Particularly common on west sides of oceans Weak trade wind inversion Most common during late summer and early fall ITCZ farthest poleward, oceans warmest Mainly travel westward in easterly flow Curve northward along east coasts Paths can be very erratic Hurricane Structure Air spirals into deep central low at surface Very high velocities develop Minimum 70mph up to nearly 200mph Steep gradients Conservation of angular momentum Rapid uplift in rain bands fueled by latent heating Heavy, high intensity precipitation Strong outflow out of high aloft to maintain deep low Subsidence in eye produces warm, clear conditions Relies on continuation of rapid evaporation from warm ocean Weakens quickly over colder water or land Winds die but can still produce very heavy precipitation Hurricane Hazards High winds and heavy precipitation Movement of hurricane intensifies winds in forward direction Heavy surf Storm surge Produced by high winds and extreme low pressure Can elevate ocean surface as much as 20 ft Rapid inflow and outflow can undermine structures build on sand Human casualties reduced significantly by improved prediction and evacuation plans Property damage increasing due to intensive build up of low-lying coastal areas Richelieu Apartments on Gulf Coast before Camile in 1969 Richelieu Apartments after hurricane party for Camile Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina Before After Hurricane Andrew in South Florida Most expensive hurricane to date",1.4214075803756714],["Hurricanes Hurricanes form over the ocean, creating huge waves, which pile up along the shore.",1.4041911363601685],["Coastal Flood -
