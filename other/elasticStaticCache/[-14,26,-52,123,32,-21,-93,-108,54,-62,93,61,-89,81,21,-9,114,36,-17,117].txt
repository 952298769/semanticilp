-->",0.856026291847229],["X1011589444-00035-08583</DOCNO> Boston Review: the noise of time the noise of time i suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in

Bennie And The Jets Goodbye Yellow Brick Road This Song Has No Title Grey Seal Jamaica Jerk Off I've Seen That Movie Too Sweet Painted Lady The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) Dirty Little Girl All The Girls Love Alice Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll) Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting Roy Rogers Social Disease Harmony Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding The roses in the window box Have tilted to one side Everything about this house Was born to grow and die Oh it doesn't seem a year ago To this very day You said I'm sorry honey If I don't change the pace I can't face another day And love lies bleeding in my hand Oh it kills me to think of you with another man I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan But my guitar couldn't hold you So I split the band Love lies bleeding in my hands I wonder if those changes Have left a scar on you Like all the burning hoops of fire That you and I passed through You're a bluebird on a telegraph line I hope you're happy now Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl You'll make it back somehow Candle In The Wind Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your \nbrain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would have liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude Goodbye Norma Jean From the young man in the 22nd row Who sees you as something as more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe Bennie And The Jets Hey kids, shake it loose together The spotlight's hitting something That's been known to change the weather We'll kill the fatted calf tonight So stick around You're gonna hear electric music Solid walls of sound Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful Oh Bennie she's really keen She's got electric boots a mohair suit You know I read it in a magazine Bennie and the Jets Hey kids, plug into the faithless Maybe they're blinded But Bennie makes them ageless We shall survive, let us take ourselves along Where we fight our parents out in the streets To find who's right and who's wrong Goodbye Yellow Brick Road When are you gonna come down When are you going to land I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods Hunting the horny back toad Oh I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do then I bet that'll shoot down your plane It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics To set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacement There's plenty like me to be found Mongrels who ain't got a penny Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground This Song Has No Title Tune me in to the wild side of life I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife Take me to the garretts where the artists have died Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines Look in the mirror and stare at myself And wonder if that's really me on the shelf And each day I learn just a little bit more I don't know why but I do know what for If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune Take me down alleys where the murders are done In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun Want to read books in the studies of men Born on the breeze and die on the wind If I was an artist who paints with his eyes I'd study my subject and silently cry Cry for my darkness to come down on me For confusion to carry on turning the wheel Grey Seal Why's it never light on my lawn Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born On the big screen they showed us the sun But not as bright in life as the real one It's never quite the same as the real one And tell me grey seal How does it feel To be so wise To see through eyes That only see what's real Tell me grey seal I never learned why meteors were formed I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn If anyone can cry then so can I I read books and draw life from the eye All my life is drawings from the eye Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men The roots were formed by twisted roots Your roots were twisted then I was re-born before all life could die The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I Jamaica Jerk Off When she gets up in the morning It's enough to wake the dead Oh she turning on the radio And dancing on my head It's no good living in the sun Playing guitar all day Boogalooing with my friends In that erotic way Come on Jamaica In Jamaica all day Dancing with your darling Do Jamaica jerk-off that way Come on Jamaica Everybody say We're all happy in Jamaica Do Jamaica Jerk-off that way Let the ladies and the gentlemen Be as rude as they like On the beaches, oh in the jungle Where the people feel alright So do it Jamaica Got plenty for you and me Honky tonking with my baby In that deep blue sea I've Seen That Movie Too I can see by your eyes you must be lying When you think I don't have a clue Baby you're crazy If you think that you can fool me Because I've seen that movie too The one where the players are acting surprised Saying love' \ns just a four letter word Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes Well their actions become so absurd So keep your auditions for somebody Who hasn't got so much to lose 'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting That I've seen that movie too It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around Stop twinkling your star like you do I'm not the blue print for all of your B films Because I've seen that movie too Sweet Painted Lady I'm back on dry land once again Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain We're all hunting honey with money to burn Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned If the boys all behave themselves here Well there's pretty young ladied and beer in the rear You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright So she lays down beside me again My sweet painted lady, the one with no name Many have used her and many still do There's a place in the world for a woman like you Oh sweet painted lady Seems it's always been the same Getting paid for being laid Guess that's the name of the game Forget us we'll have gone very soon Just forget we ever slept in your rooms And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds Where love's just a job and nothing is said The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) Some punk with a shotgun Killed young Danny Bailey In cold blood, in the lobby Of a downtown motel Killed him in anger A force he couldn't handle Helped pull the trigger That cut short his life And there's not many knew him The way that we did Sure enough he was a wild one But then aren't most hungry kids Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in Dillinger's dead I guess the cops won again Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in We're running short of heroes Back up here in the hills Without Danny Bailey We're gonna have to break up our stills So mark his grave well 'Cause Kentucky loved him Born and raised a proper I guess life just bugged him And he found faith in danger A lifestyle he lived by A running gun younster In a sad restless age Dirty Little Girl I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard When I watch the police come by and move you on Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl Someone grab that bitch by the ears Rub her down scrub her back And turn her inside out 'Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped All The Girls Love Alice Raised to be a lady by the golden rule Alice was the spawn of a public school With a double barrel name in the back of her brain And a simple case of Mummy doesn't love me\" blues Reality it seems was just a dream She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen And hey, hey, hey, you know what I mean All the young girls love Alice Tender young Alice they say Come over and see me Come over and please me Alice it's my turn today All the young girls love Alice Tender young Alice they say If I give you my number Will you promise to call me Wait till my husband's away Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part Getting your kicks in another girl's bed And it was only last Tuesday oh they found you in the subway dead And who could you call your friends

roll Your sister can't \ntwist but she got more soul than me Somebody help me 'cause the bug bit me Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet But I'll be back tonight where the music plays And your sister rocks all my blues away I really got buzzed when your sister said Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting It's getting late have you seen my mates Ma tell me when the boys get here It's seven o'clock and I want to rock Want to get a

conversation His old mind, it wanders some But a better compadre ain&#146;t lived or breathed Than my ole&#146; amigo Lum Now Lum, he&#146;s plenty punchy Ya won&#146;t find a tougher old coot But down right, plain old common sense Ain&#146;t one of his stronger suits You won&#146;t find a better feller To have round ya in a pinch His head&#146;s as hard as granite rock And he won&#146;t give an inch We were cowboyin&#146; up in the Keechi hills It was one of our lighter days But we&#146;d &#145;bout had our bellies full Of cuttin&#146; those cedar stays The weekend, now was comin&#146; up Time for the big rodeo in town Been quite a spell since we&#146;d been in Lum and me would ride on down Now Lum ain&#146;t no spring chicken But he acts just like a kid When the bullriders finally mount the beasts Used to twist &#145;em himself, he did The crowd gathered &#145;round the buckin&#146; chutes They were thick as bitin&#146; fleas And Lum, his stature&#146;s lackin&#146; some Makin&#146; it tough for him to see Ole&#146; Lum sure ain&#146;t no genius But what next he did made sense He climbed up near the buckin&#146; chutes And sat upon the fence The fence sure ain&#146;t as comfy As his recliner back at the shack And the cable through the cross-tie posts Seemed to be a little slack Now ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s kinda portly Of a diet he ain&#146;t thought So the cable strand he sat upon Down the line had been drawn taught The announcer&#146;s voice boomed loudly Of the high horned brindle beast Two thousand pounds of ragin&#146; hell Was soon to be released On Widowmaker, they kicked the latch He followed the gate around Then planted his feet and sucked back left And slammed that cowboy down He gave the clown a hookin&#146; Made a lap around the pen But there ain&#146;t a fence for a hundred miles That could hold this brinlde in The Widowmaker, he sized it up Then made a fitful run He was intent on clearin&#146; that fence Just four posts down from Lum He quit the earth in one great leap Now comes the change of events A solid ton of snortin&#146; beef Hit smack on top of that \nfence Ole&#146; Lum, he&#146;s cool, just sat there calm With both hands in his pockets But a ton of bull on that cable strand Shot Lum off like a rocket Now Lum survived the launchin&#146; And annihilation merely by chance But he didn&#146;t make re-entry &#145;Till halfway through the dance Lum told me it wasn&#146;t the launch Nor the fallin&#146;, nor the drop The thing that hurt his ole&#146; body so Was that mighty sudden stop Lum believes the moral here Needs tellin&#146; to all you fans It&#146;s best to watch the rodeo From somewhere in the stands 1999, Jay Snider, All rights reserved Four Little Words Four little words have stuck in my mind From the time I was just a small child &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148; is what he would say When he talked of the men he admired I remember those men he talked about Sure &#145;nuff cowboys, tough, but kind They said what they meant and meant what they said These men are getting&#146; harder to find &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he was true to his word That&#146;s all you expect of a man You knew for sure he was proud to meet you By the genuine shake of his hand &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant you could depend On this man no matter the task Never got too tough, too cold, or too late For his help, all you need do is ask &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he had a light hand Be it with horses or cattle or crew He spent most of his life learning this cowboy trade And he&#146;d be honored to teach it to you &#147;There&#146; a good feller&#148; meant don&#146;t ask him to do What ain&#146;t on a true and honest track He knows it&#146;s easier to keep a good reputation Than it is to try to build one back &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant he&#146;s a fair minded man He helped write cowboyin&#146;s unwritten laws He won&#146;t ask you to do what he wouldn&#146;t do Yet knows, at times, the short end you&#146;ll draw &#147;There&#146;s a good feller,&#148; meant, when he&#146;s down on his luck He can still hold his head way up high &#145;Cause he did his best and gave it his all He knows with faith and God&#146;s help he&#146;ll get by &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words And their meaning won&#146;t run all that deep But when Dad would use &#145;em to describe certain men You knew they were at the top of the heap &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148;, just four little words But they&#146;ve always been favorites of mine If after my trails end, my name&#146;s brought up &#147;There&#146;s a good feller&#148; would suit me just fine Jay Snider, All rights reserved The Cattle Market Me and the cattle market need to get in synch This terminal poverty is a bunch of bull When the market goes up, I won&#146;t own but three When it&#146;s down, my pastures are full Now I&#146;m not one for gripin&#146; And I dearly love this life But fifty- cent calves and ten dollar feed Is hard to explain to my wife But she wouldn&#146;t trade it for a job in town The new babies, she names &#145;em all And she&#146;ll be mad for two months runnin&#146; When I sell &#145;em off in the fall I&#146;ve read and studied genetics I think my breeding program is keen But I have an idea I&#146;m missin&#146; something Cause my calves all looks Holstein Blacks and baldies are the packer&#146;s choice I thought I&#146;d have &#145;er made last fall But calving time proved disappointing The neighbor&#146;s longhorn had sired &#145;em all This year&#146;s crop is a sight to behold I&#146;ve been assured they&#146;re some of the best But my banker will get almost all they bring And Ivomec will get the rest My fences are in need of major repairs And I&#146;m just nearly out of hay But if the market stays up, I won&#146;t own but three cows And I won&#146;t need fences anyway Forty- percent cubes are the best you can buy To hear the man at the Co-op tell it But I buy the cheap twenty- percent kind So my cows can have more than one pellet My banker agrees that I need some help But that ranchin&#146;sure ain&#146;t my callin&#146; He allows I ought to sell off my cows Cause the darned market&#146;s started fallin&#146; If the bottom falls out of the market now I&#146;ll have way too many again So I&#146;ll sell &#145;em off and cut my loss But now I&#146;m right back where I&#146;ve been When spring grass comes, I&#146;ll buy some back Cause without &#145;em I&#146;d sooner die I&#146;ll bet a hundred the market will be up And they&#146;ll be too darned high to buy So I&#146;ll patiently wait till the market goes down And I can buy &#145;em real cheap you see Then I&#146;ll keep &#145;em and feed &#145;em till the market goes up Or till my \nbanker takes all but &#145;bout three 2000, Jay Snider, All rights reserved Two of a Kind I thought he&#146;d lost his mind That cold December day When he came draggin&#146; in That little snake poor bay, Lord, what a sight He looked near dead And there ain&#146;t no way That neck will hold up that head, For a two year old past He wasn&#146;t very big And those little old legs Why they&#146;ll snap like a twig, Now this man knows horses At least I thought he did But, I sure think he missed this one When he turned in his bid, Said, &#147;He don&#146;t look like much now, son But a good worming, plenty of feed and hay, This little ugly duckling He&#146;ll make a good one some

\n2e -->",0.7125709056854248],["A CLOSER LOOK AT GENETIC ENGINEERING Experiments Generally Consist of Four Stages Stage 1: Cleavage Via restriction endonucleases Large number of specific fragments called library Different library for each specific sequence Fragments compared by electrophoresis fig 19.6 Stage 2: Producing recombinant DNA Fragments put into plasmids or virus vehicles Fragment replicated with vehicle genome Stage 3: Cloning Fragment-containing vehicles introduced into bacteria Bacteria reproduce making identical replicas Each cell line maintained separately Whole set constitutes clone library of original DNA Stage 4: Screening Identify clone line containing fragment of interest Among most difficult and critical steps Preliminary Screening of Clones Eliminate bacteria not containing proper DNA fragment Use genes conferring antibiotic resistance fig 19.7a Eliminate bacteria without vehicle Culture clones on medium containing antibiotic Only bacteria resistant to antibiotic will grow on it Eliminate bacteria with vehicle, but lacking fragment Use vector with gene that enables cell to metabolize X-gal sugar Metabolism of X-gal produces blue product Cells with vector and functional gene will turn blue fig 19.7b Test clones for presence of X-gal metabolism Clones with fragment lose ability to metabolize sugar DNA fragment within gene makes it inoperative Cells remain colorless in presence of X-gal Finding the Gene of Interest fig 19.8 Clone library may contain thousands of DNA fragments Southern blot technique Fragments spread apart by electrophoresis Gel blotted with nitrocellulose, DNA transfers to sheet Probe poured onto nitrocellulose sheet Only fragments with proper gene hybridize with probe Probe may be radioactive chemical Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) fig 19.9 Cut DNA samples with particular restriction Separate fragments according to length with electrophoresis Use radioactive probe to identify fragments Obtain unique pattern of bands in gel Called \"DNA fingerprinting\" Used in criminal forensic investigations Used as markers to identify carriers of certain genetic disorders Getting Enough DNA to Work With: The Polymerase Chain Reaction Produce multiple identical copies of DNA fig 19.10 PCR used to amplify sequences or add sequences as primers to cleaved DNA Five steps in PCR process Tagging Primer of synthetic nucleotides mixed with DNA fragment template Increase size of fragment and give it a unique tag Heating Temperature of mixture increased to 98% C Both primed fragment and oligonucleotide dissociate into single strands Priming Solution cooled to 60% C Single strands of DNA reassociate into double strands Fragment base-pairs with complementary primer nucleotide Part of fragment still single stranded Copying Heat stable DNA polymerase added along with supply of all four nucleotides Polymerase copies rest of fragment as in DNA replication Oligonucleotide primer lengthened into complementary copy of single-stranded fragment Two copies of original now exist Repeating the cycle Repeat heating and cooling in short cycles Each cycle doubles amount of DNA After twenty cycles one fragment can become more than one million PCR allows investigation of minute samples of DNA Has had enormous impact on all aspects of biology fig 19.11 BIO TECHNOLOGY: A SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION Pharmaceuticals Most obvious commercial application of gene technology Bacteria can produce gene products in bulk Several forms of interferon, human insulin Manufacture valuable nonhuman enzymes Produce medically important proteins Atrial peptides: regulate blood pressure, kidney function Tissue plasminogen activator: dissolves blood clots Must separate desired protein from bacterial proteins Time-consuming and expensive Produce RNA transcripts of genes Make proteins directly in cell-free culture Probing the Human Genome Localize cloned gene location via radioactive probe Construction of clonal libraries Use large-size restriction fragments Associate disease genes with restriction fragments Identify presence of fragments with electrophoresis Do genetic screening for potential birth defects Attempt treatment or cure with gene therapy Example: cystic fibrosis Propose sequencing of entire human genome fig 19.12 Construct detailed map of human genome Controversial as it requires significant resources Piggyback Vaccines Subunit vaccines for herpes virus and hepatitis viruses fig 19.13 Protein-polysaccharide coat genes isolated Spliced to vaccinia virus DNA Live vaccinia added to cell culture with fragments Recombinant virus carries coat genes of other virus Infected animal produces antibodies to outer surface of virus Make antibodies against virus without exposure to it Agriculture Initial difficulty in identifying suitable plant vector Currently use Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium Infects broad leaf plants but not cereal plants Attach other genes to this plasmid fig 19.14 Development of Flavr Savr tomatoes Contain fish antifreeze gene Produce ethylene glycol from ethylene Lack of ethylene delays ripening of fruit \nHerbicide Resistance Broadleaf plants engineered to be resistant to glyphosate Glyophosate is the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide fig 19.15 Extra copies of EPSP synthetase gene via Ti plasmid Plants overproduce enzyme Overcome glyphosate suppression Advantages Crops would not need to be weeded Wide variety of weeds killed and desired crop spared Glyphosate readily degradable Virus Resistance Ti plasmids introduce genes into broadleaf plants TMV protein coat genes placed into tobacco chromosomes fig 19.16 Grow plant via tissue culture All progeny cells contain TMV coat genes Transgenic plants do not develop disease as if infected with whole TMV Insect Resistance Insects presently controlled via chemical insecticides Engineer plants for resistance to insects Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein genes fig 19.17 Ingested by tomato hornworm, converted to poison Harmless to animals with different stomach enzymes Genes introduced into plants via Ti plasmid Plants safe from attack by insects that eat them fig 19.18 Examples: Genetically altered potato kills Colorado potato beetle Cotton resistant to bollworms Corn resists European corn borer Isolation insect-killing enzyme from a fungus Cholesterol oxidase disrupts insect gut membranes Fungal gene inserted into a variety of crops Kills variety of insects including cotton boll weevil and Colorado potato beetle Introduce insecticidal protein into root bacteria B. thuringiensis does not normally inhabit roots Protect roots from various pests, including Pseudomonas Nitrogen Fixation Insert proper genes into non-leguminous plants Provide plants with own fertilizer Farm Animals Somatotropin growth hormone (BST) synthetically produced Added to diary cow`s diet to increase milk yield fig 19.19 Potential to increase weight of cattle and pigs fig 19.20 Human tests to increase size of hormonal dwarfs Public resistance to BST in milk Generalized fears of gene technology BST is a proteins, digested in stomach Development of transgenic animals Other Applications Create strains of bacteria to eat oil spills Grow \"synthetic cotton\" Forensic use Identification of individuals Ethics and Regulation Concerns regarding tampering with genetic material Accidental production of a cancer-transmitting bacterium Intentional development of a killer virus Dangerous complications of genetically engineered products administered to plants or animals in future generations Ecological impact of \"improved\" crops Potential of creating \"genetically superior\" organisms, including humans Most of public's concerns not well-founded Most organisms used in genetic engineering incompatible with human hosts Recombinant technology like natural crossing, only faster Genetic \"dabbling\" by humans minuscule compared to natural mutations Genetic engineering research under close scrutiny Appropriate experimental safeguards established Scientists well-trained Products tested for years prior to marketing

calories per day just to stay alive but as we look at animals with larger and larger bodies, the metabolic rate (calories per hour) rises more slowly than the body weight that is, a larger animal needs fewer calories per pound of body weight than a smaller animal so a smaller animal has to eat more relative to its body weight so smaller animals generally have to concentrate on foods with a high caloric payoff while larger animals can eat foods with a lower caloric content think of hummingbirds, eating high-sugar flower nectar all animals would be happy to subsist on such high-quality food, but there just is not enough of it around, or it is distributed in packages too small, to support a large-bodied animal while elephants eat leaves, straw, woody plant parts these require that the elephant eat them in large quantities and digest them for some time these foods have fewer calories per pound of food but are widely available, so a large animal with a lower requirement of calories per pound of body weight can find enough but a small animal could not stuff enough of these foods into its body at one time to get the calories it needed activity requires additional energy, so a typical animal might need to eat enough to provide twice its basal metabolic rate so a very active animal needs more food than one that moves slowly growing requires additional energy you all know that growing children need to eat a lot gestating (being pregnant) requires additional energy gestation increases a female's caloric needs up to 25% the additional calories required increase from almost none right after conception, to about 25% of the female's normal requirement as birth approaches lactating (producing milk) requires even more than pregnancy lactation increases a female's caloric needs about 50% she is \"eating for two\" (or really \"one and a half\") in addition to energy (calories) the diet also needs to include enough protein (amino acids), vitamins, minerals, some elements (like iron) calories are provided by carbohydrates, fats, and oils and the diet should not have too much of any chemicals that are toxic or impede digestion like most mammals, primates also need to drink water most need water at least once a day Food sources: different primates concentrate on many different foods most primates each many different foods, often 50 or more kinds but each species emphasizes certain foods more than others primates (and other animals) need two general categories of foods some foods that provide carbohydrates other foods that provide protein most prosimians get carbohydrates from gum and fruit protein from insects most anthropoids get carbohydrates from fruit protein from insects or young leaves most primates are fairly focussed on certain types of foods see chart on page 174 to get an idea of the variation in primate diets chimps eat mostly fruit, with smaller amounts of leaves, insects, very occasional meat, etc. Bushbabies (or galagos), a kind of prosimian, get 70% of their diet from insects, 20% from fruit, and 10% from gum Spider monkeys get 80% of their diet from fruit, and 20% from leaves Langurs get about 65% of their diet from leaves, 25% from fruit, and 10% from flowers etc. while one type of food usually predominates, most primates do eat a variety of foods unlike many other animals, they are not highly specialized on one particular kind of food categories of food specializations: insectivore : insect eater insectivores are usually small insects provide good quality, rapidly digestible food, but in small packages larger animals would have trouble getting enough food if they depended on insects unless they had some highly efficient method of getting a lot of them, like the long, specialized tongue of an anteater while small animals have to depend on rapidly digestible food, because of their relatively higher metabolic rate they simply can't eat enough volume of low-quality food to get the calories they need insectivores typically have high, pointy cusps on the teeth, including the molars, for breaking into the insect's tough exoskeletons short, simple digestive tract gummivore : plant gum eater gummivores are also usually small same reasons as insectivores gummivores typically have sturdy incisors, and sometimes canines, that stick forward and are shaped for gouging into bark and scraping off gum frugivore : fruit eater frugivores tend to be intermediate in size fruits have fewer calories per pound than do insects and gum, but are still much better than leaves and other plant parts fruit is typically more widely available, and in larger package sizes, than insects and gum frugivores typically have wide incisors for scraping out the meat of fruits from their rinds low, rounded molar cusps for pulverizing fruit often have large stomachs to hold the bulky leaves and other plant parts they eat along with the fruit folivore : leaf eater (\" \nfoliage\") folivores tend to be intermediate to large in size leaves offer relatively few calories per pound, but are very plentiful but an animal has to be relatively large to physically process enough leaves and must have relatively lower caloric needs per pound of body weight folivores typically have sharp, ridged molars for shearing leaves into small bits long, more specialized digestive tract for processing a lot of leaves often with a specialized section to house microorganisms that break down cellulose often with a very large stomach to hold the large volumes of leaves required to get enough calories notice that there are no primate carnivores (unless you count insects as \"meat\") some primates occasionally eat some other vertebrates, but it is not a predominant part of the diet Food distribution most primates live in tropical forests where there are many different kinds of trees, but often individual trees of any given type are widely separated we are used to forests of oaks, for example, where you find one oak tree after another, and acorns are all around tropical forests are much more variable;",0.668492317199707],["The good bacteria stick to the plant surfaces and block the entrance

mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten to open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first \ninto the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions from a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and \npainter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later from someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably

the dawn of another new day That fateful restless night ages ago And you look at yourself, who you are You see the same face, same hand, same tongue And you think to yourself It's been too many nights with Too so suddenly be without And despite your hands face and tongue are the same Your heart isn't and never will be For she is yours in heart but someone else's in hand And it's her face that's against another's And it's now her heart, that has two men's affection Innocent Ignorance Where once warm hands held tight Now cooler hearts stand alone Time has passed like sands through the hourglass But the feelings of the heart hold fast Trials and tribulatiosn for us both Some of the most challenging times of our lives But we'd always be ok at night When we'd return home to each other Hold hands, and ever so softly kiss Softly, yet deeply, and passionately All our cares and worries would vanish As if they never existed to begin with We had a special, innocent pure love Despite the fact we knew we didn't have long Our future's destined to be different Our ambitions always the same Quantity was never a matter to us For the quality was always more then amazing And when the time to realize this happened Amazingly deep and seemingly never ending pain came Our worlds were flipped and we were tossed with chaos But despite all the pain, there was no anger As time passed the pain slowed Duller and duller it was with each passing month But it was still there like a constant headache But now a year approaches and we face a challenge Whether to celebrate our times together Or whether to mourn the losses we assumed Or whether we should just pretend like nothing happened Our loves nor lives the same as before So the fish is left to wander the stream in his westward direction Only to hope to not be pulled down by the easterner Thanksgiving The day to give thanks comes and goes You give thanks for your heart You give thanks for your life And you give thanks for the love of your heart Despite no longer do you hold it You remember how she made you feel How complete and bright she made your life And how she made you feel invincible The day has passed without many adieus The days to commemorate a love of life The days to commemorate a life of love And the days to remember all of our blessings A year has passed since these last occurrences Some you beg God never to remind you of Others you pray for every day to be repeated Like the day when you fell in love for the first time That day when the world you live in No longer remained in black, whites and grays But became filled with the colors of the rainbow The colors of love, the colors of life And your contrite spirit once again had breath For God did hear you and consoled the broken heart But it was only to let Satan break your brain Spill blood and muscles and heart and lungs all over Cover the pavement with all your good sense Rape the innocence of your mind Fragmentize all your memories and make you doubt All that you once held sacred, holy and just So this thanksgiving you're left here now With a healed body and a healed mind But a broken heart, which may never mend Iris Music swirls in your head and makes you shiver Sheer ecstacy fills your ears and hands But as the piece comes to an end For some odd reason the feeling doesn't change The source which was once your music Has changed to simply your surroundings now Or so it seems to have for now you are left in silence And the rest of the lonely is like a broken heart A single solitary player of a single solitary instrument For now you are confused as you look to your right And you see a new set of blue eyes looking at you There is no love, no lust, no admiration nor exhilaration But at the same time there is no hard heart behind them For that heart listens to the music of your voice Not the mistakes of your hands nor your lack of charm Impressions irrevocably riveted in place eons ago But deeper more purging ideas planted by your music The music of your heart, the music of your soul For the mind knows not what the heart sees And the mind never could comprehend what the ear hears The pale icy cold metallic blue irises never shall lie Just like the chords in our music \nnever lie If only the iris would last longer then the chords And if only the iris was as harmless as the chords New Start The time to weep has not passed The days and night not gone fast But now you see a new one near And it's that which you fear The feelings aren't quite the same But it's your heart that does claim That times gone by aren't to stay It is this time this very day That hurt shall no longer rest Where love and kindness fit the best For in those eyes you did see What it was that would set you free Free from the pain and misery of your past Free from the love that did not last Free from the strings tied to your heart That were there right from the start And free from the green stars in her eyes For it was those stars that made you cry And now you look into another's blue iris And it's her cheek you now kiss Your heart still isn't all what it once was But know you've past that feeling so remiss Neither love nor pain now has hold of you But a happy confusion of what is true You know not what your heart really feels But you recognize the absence of what was real And now when you kiss a hand your heart doesn't ache And when you get a hug your heart doesn't break For now in your eyes you see not a heart Now in her eyes you see a fresh new start Quantum's From the deepest trenches of the lake A small bright light emerges A tempest of blue and white all at once Just in the one tiny photon there Your tiny vessel of life is rocking slowly On the harsh waves of the turbulent sea Queasiness in your stomach takes hold Not from the light, more in from the lack of light In enough quantums to keep you satisfied That light no matter how small is magnificent Always has been, always will be Even if it does come in different quantities Because regardless of where the light comes from It's always from some sort of precious hidden jewel But it's the lights from blue diamonds That are the light which you always shall search Because the light like the rock itself Can and will withstand all the world's heats Pressures, blows, colds and sharp cuts Its that light which will never be hidden once discovered But to uncover all its amazing deep beauty You must risk your life by plunging into the sea The cold, deep, tretcherous, mischievious and dark sea To find the rock from which it emminates And uncover it to bring to the surface to keep as yours Where you can polish it and keep it close at heart So when the waves of the sea make you sick again You can look at the jewel and find purity And then find inner strength and peace in yourself Only to look at the jewel again And wonder how you survived so long with out it Hey guys!",0.6551761031150818],["Further up the food chain, there are

politically correct no matter what you say Convincing us all in every single kind of way Cos you frame the words so that we really believe That there's a depth in the message that you're trying to achieve So you twist your tongue to make it all sound true Making us believe that we haven't got a clue You tell us all exactly what you think we want to hear With theatrical tactics to boost your career Every promise you make is just a promise you break And you can never admit that you could make a mistake Because you say one thing and you mean something else You only care about yourself and your wealth so all I say is Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Do you want it why do you want it With your military mind you were born a leader And discipline and order is an everyday procedure Sp bring out the man in every innocent boy Amd teach them how to kill so they can search and destroy To protect and to serve and to die with honour and pride You say you're fighting for peace but that's the biggest lie You're preparing for war and your martial law But you don't know what it's for any more so all I say is Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Do you want it why do you want it Power is a sickness power is to blame Power is a weapon and it's driving me insane Power is an enemy, power is pain Power is a war but to you it's just a game Power is glory, power is gold Power is chaos and you're out of control Power isn't freedom, power is a cage Power is your sin and it feeds my rage Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Power to the one who doesn't want it Do you want it why do you want it 2: Pay The Bill I can't complain I've made myself a name And all I really want is five minutes of fame Some material wealth and a life in good health Cos all I really care about is myself I don't know a single thing about the situation But why should I care about the next generation I've got everything I need but I still want more I can't understand why you complain cos you're poor I don't feel sorry for you we've got the same possibilities It's \nall about taking your own responsibility I took mine so I deserve what I got I've got my name on the wall of fame I'm going straight to the top It cost me a lot of money but I took my degree And that's the biggest difference between you and me There's not a thing in the world that my money can't buy I can't understand why you didn't even try So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill You can't blame me because you're underfed You should be glad that you've got a roof over your head If you worked for a living you could pay your rent Instead of begging me for help when all you're money's spent You won't ever fool me because I know your type I see you standing on the corner like a parasite You're a loser and you know it but you don't even care I can't understand why you say life ain't fair So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill And the next generation has to pay the bill Pay the bill pay the bill the next generation has to pay the bill The next generation has to pay pay the bill Give me one good reason why I shouldn't complain I've done everything I can but it's still the same I've got nothing to lose so why should I give a fuck My life's a piece of shit and that's where I'm stuck I never got a fair chance to even prove myself So tell me why should I be nice to anybody else You say you can't understand why I say life is a bitch I can't understand how you can be so rich So what do you mean we've got the same possibilities I haven't even got your educational abilities I dropped out of school before I took me degree Cos the welfare line made more sense to me I try to work for a living so I can pay all my debts And I've come to realize this is as good as it gets I hate my fucking life more than you hate me I just can't understand why this is how it should be So I complain it's still the same We're standing still while the next generation has to pay the bill So I complain it's still the same We're standing still while the next generation has to pay the bill Pay the bill pay the bill the next generation has to pay, pay the bill 3: Pin Me Down I try to hide and deny my inner thoughts and true reactions By fooling myself with ill-concealed dissatisfaction I can't take it any more I can't stand the situation I don't want to be a victim of another confrontation I'll pretend that I know I need you to sympathize I'm so unsure of myself so please don't you criticize You can bend me and shake me you can twist me till I break And whatever you do I'll take the blame for your mistakes Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out You want to shape me up so that you can mould me in You want to fold me out just so you can fit me in You feed me full with your discriminating terrible lies What do you want from me should I believe in all your alibies I don't know where to go so which way should I turn I try to understand but you don't want me to learn You tie my feet to the ground there's not a chance that I can walk I want to scream but you gag my mouth so I can't talk Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out You want to stretch me out just so you can pin me down You want to dry me out just so you can watch me drown You want to watch me starve so you can force me to eat And then you knock me down when I'm back on my feet Pin me down I put my hands over my mouth When I need to shout you pin me down I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out 4: Waste My Time From the white man's mouth and the white man's tongue There's been hundreds of years of diabolical dung So much prejudice piss has been trickling down And I can smell the shit coming from miles around You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time I'm not white I'm punk the but colour of my face Represents a fucking farce called the superior face White power bullshit I'll wipe my pink fucking ass With your swastika flag cos it belongs to the past You want me to believe that dark skin is a sin Well wake up it's 95 where the fuck have you been What are you trying to achieve with your racist crap That shit's coming out the \ncrack from the bottom of your back You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time You are making me sick with your pathetic ricks You try to tell me different colours don't mix You tell us so many lies that you believe them yourself You spent your whole life blaming everyone else You're so full of shit you're out of your mind What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time Waste my time 5: Die High Going down slow, how low can you get Before you break yourself and wake up in a sweat On the killing floor with the damage done You can pity yourself but your race is run You can climb the walls without reaching the top And the higher you feel the further you drop But you just want to get high Going one step further, slipping down the line You're living your life on borrowed time How much abuse can you take from yourself Is your addiction worth more than life itself When you make the bet you have to pay the debt And if you're lucky you can live with your own reget or you can get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high There's a lot of good reasons but no excuse You can never justify your drug abuse You can legalize the hit but the problems remain You still feel like shit the effect's the same You're wasting your time with that fucking crap The choice is yours and I can give you that And you still want to get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high You can never rely on the drugs you buy You can never deny all the tricks you try You can do anything just to get your fix You can try anything just to get your kicks You don't hesitate to cheat or lie And bad excuse is a good abili You say you hate yourself and you want to die But it's all the same you still want to get high Get high push your luck to the limit You're gonna die high Get high if you think you can win it You're gonna die high Don't lie cos you're stuck right in it You're gonna die high Get high why the fuck are you in it You're gonna die high 6: It I can hear it in your voice I can see it in your eyes I can smell it in the air I can hear it in your sighs The way you look at me and the way that you act The way you make me feel I have to react Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more It's painful to see I can't take it any more I know what it is I can see it in my dreams I know what it's like I know what it means I can make it go away I can make it disappear I can make it right I can make it happen here Feels like I have to do it it has to be done It's time to get it over with it's useless to run It could have been something nice you said to me But I can hear it in your voice you just pity me You make fun out of me and every word that I say And I can hear you laugh when I walk away So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend You don't know who I am I'm not your friend You don't think I know but I can read between the lines Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs Nobody knows it and nobody can see I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when But it's happened before and it can happen again I want to do things to you that you'll never forget It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get 7: Do What I Say Don't to this don't do that Don't you ever talk back Don't speak with food in your mouth Just keep quiet while the grown ups are talking I'm not being mean I'm just being fair It's just because I really care You know that I love you But shut your mouth you just have to do what I say I don't want you to lie You're much too old to cry You're just to young to know But when you're older you'll understand You are mine I own you Look at me I'm talking to you Don't use that tone to me So shut your mouth you just have to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way I've paid to raise you good \nDone everything I could so don't you dare to say That I ever cared about you anyway I gave you good food to eat I kept you on your feet I gave you all my good advice Not once did I hear you thank me for all that I've done You don't know anything About my suffering I went through a lot of pain Just to get you where you are today If I ever hit you It's because I have to You have done something wrong And you deserve the punishment, you'll have to pay When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way Don't ask me why not Be glad with what you've got DOn't tell me you're alone You should be glad that you have a home Just look me in the eyes You have to realize I make the rules that's it It's for your own good so you have to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do what I say When I grow up there will be a day When everybody has to do it my way 8: Undone When I was young I was taught to throw sticks and stones Because sticks and stones they could break your bones The only way to get ahead that made any kind of sense Was to enrich myself at other people's expense I could walk over corpses to make myself a name I would cheat and I could lie without showing no shame People tried to stop me but they didn't understand I wasn't looking for affection or a helping hand Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why I never told the truth cos I believe all my lies I believed that if I made my own alibis I would find a good reason and a better excuse So I could justify my hate and my self abuse I would satisfy myself in any way I could Because I knew that I would always be misunderstood I did a lot of mean things that are hard to forgive But all I ever wanted was a life to live Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why Looking back at my life there's a lot I regret I made a lot of mistakes that I can never forget But I didn't know better I was insecure I guess I never took care of my problems before I feel bad about the people that I pushed around I feel bad about the people that I let down I put the blame on myself I can't look the other way Living with my guilt is the price I have to pay Why doesn't anybody listen Why doesn't anybody hear Why doesn't anybody see me Why doesn't you interfere Don't ask me why 9: What Are You Afraid Of?",0.6429582238197327],["The bacteria that causes tooth decay produce a glue that helps them stick to the teeth.",0.6417673826217651],["The partnership

Defective Genes - Descendents Of The Shoah And The Third Reich His Blind Date A Traditional Family Not Worth Mentioning Words Defective Genes The Master Race His Blind Date when his brother's girlfriend asks him to be the blind date for a pretty German girl visiting her aunt in Antwerp the words he hears are pretty and girl - at age twenty his thoughts of girls and how to meet them consume many of his waking hours only later after he has accepted this blind date his first does the girl's nationality cause him alarm anxiety intrudes into his eager expectations grows stronger as the afternoon comes to a close by early evening he is almost ready to call it off -- all afternoon he has remembered what his father has written into the family's Bible -- in memory of my dear father killed by the Germans in memory of my dear mother killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Elijahu his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Tsilia her husband and three children killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Chaim his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Hannah and her husband killed by the Germans in memory of my cousins aunts and uncles killed by the Germans his mother's family had suffered a similar fate the only survivor of the nearly hundred relatives was his father's youngest sister her husband and two sons who had survived by hiding in a cramped place too low to stand upright liberated by the Russians so weak and stooped none of them could stand up straight memories he hadn't thought about for years flood him - his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork

tissues by the parasite, which causes disease (occurs in plants as well as animals) Commensalism association in which one organism (commensal) benefits, while the other (host) is neither helped nor harmed example - Clostridium and other microbes live in the human colon where they benefit from nutrients, warmth and shelter, but generally do not cause disease (normal microbiota) Mutualism association in which both organisms (mutuals) benefit examples: Escherichia coli lives in the human colon and benefits from nutrients, warmth and shelter found there, generally not causing disease, but benefiting the host by producing vitamins and preventing growth of harmful microbes lichens - associations between a mycobiont (ascomycete) and a phycobiont (green alga or cyanobacterium) mycobiont provides a stable environment (protects from excessive light, supplies water and minerals, provides a firm substrate) within which the phycobiont can grow somewhat free from environmental stress phycobiont provides oxygen, organic carbon, other nutrients for both microbes mostly ectosymbiotic, although some fungi obtain nutrients from their phycobionts using haustoria (projections of hyphae that penetrate the phycobiont cell wall) protozoan symbiosis with bacteria and archaea Personympha (a protozoan that lives in the gut of termites) can digest cellulose only because it has cellulase-producing endosymbiotic bacteria Metopus contortus (an anaerobic cilliated protozoan) has a number of symbiotes two endosymbiotes hydrogenosomes - degenerate bacteria that use pyruvate and NADH (both generated via glycolytic catabolism of the cilliate) to generate CO 2 , H 2 and acetate methanogens - use CO 2 and H 2 generated in the hydrogenosomes to generate methane one ectosymbiote - sulfate-reducing bacteria oxidize the acetate generated in the hydrogenosomes to obtain energy via anaerobic respiration and reduce sulfate in the process Strombidium purpureum - anaerobic protozoan

primers will \"find\" their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA and bind they then act as the \"starting site\" for new DNA synthesis Given a mix of nucleotides, the right enzymes, and energy, the primers will initiate synthesis of complementary DNA strands note that, for every double-stranded DNA fragment used, two copies are produced - just like in \"normal\" DNA replication in cells Then, the process is repeated: each new double-stranded DNA fragment is denatured, primers are added, etc. so the process is exponential: with each round of the process, the number of DNA fragments is doubled This technique has been very useful in many fields: in forensics, small amounts of DNA can be fingerprinted to help identify perpetrators in medicine, if we know what genes we're looking for, PCR allows us to detect even very low levels of viral DNA or DNA from cancer cells from blood samples in other areas of science, we can use PCR to analyze DNA from very small tissue samples, e.g. from ancient human bones, from insects in amber, etc. Manipulating genes: recombinant DNA technology Recombinant DNA = a DNA molecule that contains pieces that aren't found together in nature - examples include adding human genes to bacteria to generate usable proteins modifying viral DNA to make safer vaccines introduction of human genes to goats produces goats that secrete valuable proteins in their milk Gene therapy: providing \"good\" copies of genes to \"cure\" genetic diseases Once the desired gene has been isolated and synthesized, it needs to be incorporated into a vector = a system for transferring the gene into the target organism/cells/tissues two commonly-used vectors are plasmids and retroviruses using a plasmid vector to transform bacteria: selelct a plasmid that has a specific antibiotic-resistance gene use a restriction enzyme to cut the plasmid in such a way as to produce \"sticky ends\" that match the \"sticky ends\" of the DNA use DNA ligase to seal the DNA into the plasmid expose bacteria to transformed plasmids - some bacteria will take up the plasmids, some won't plate the bacteria on media containing the antibiotic to which the transformed plasmids are resistant bacteria lacking the recombinant plasmid will die, leaving behind bacteria that have successfully incorporated the recombinant plasmid Plasmid vectors can also be used with plant cells to introduce a variety of genes into plants (see fig.",0.6332162022590637],["treatment considered successful Lacked knowledge of antibodies and viruses Marberg virus cause some of most lethal diseases known to man fig 30.8 Include Ebola virus with lethality of over 90% Outbreak in 1995 threatened to spread worldwide A Viral Case Study: HIV AIDS first reported in U.S. in 1982 Infectious agent: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Closely related to African green monkey virus Etiology of the disease Affected individuals have no resistance to infection Rarely survive more than a few years, die of otherwise nonlethal diseases Transfer of body fluids poses most significant threat Incidence growing rapidly Clinical symptoms do not develop until after long period \nof latency How HIV compromises the immune system Normally a series of cells patrols bloodstream for invaders These cells are destroyed in AIDS patients, most specifically T4 cells The HIV infection cycle fig 30.9 Attachment HIV infects only T4 cells fig 30.10 Infects T4 cell by recognizing glycoprotein surface marker HIV glycoprotein precisely fits CD4 protein on T4 surface Cells lacking CD4 cannot be infected Entry Penetrates cell membrane, enters cell via endocytosis Protein coat shed Replication Single strand RNA with reverse transcriptase enzyme inside cell Viral RNA made into double-stranded

continuously THE BACTERIA Bacteria Are a Unique Group of Living Organisms Represent the oldest form of life fig 4.11 Only representatives of the prokaryotes Used to be classified as the only member of the kingdom Monera Present classification identifies two kingdoms of bacteria Archaebacteria Eubacteria Bacteria Are an Extremely Diverse Group of Organisms fig 30.11 Few major structural differences Species differentiation based on metabolic processes Characterized by growth on certain defined media Activities altered by growth conditions and chemicals Role of Bacteria Responsible for creating properties of atmosphere and soils Are autotrophic, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic, contribute to world carbon balance Are heterotrophic and break down organic compounds Only a few genera of bacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen Involved in industrial processes and chemical syntheses Produce acetic acid, vinegar, amino acids, enzymes Production of various milk products, bread and ethanol Antibiotics derived from bacterial sources Genetic engineering applications PROKARYOTES VERSUS EUKARYOTES Structural Differences Multicellularity: bacteria are fundamentally single-celled fig 30.11e, 12 May adhere within matrix, some form filaments Few integrated activities between cells Primitive colonial forms include gliding bacteria fig 30.11d Cell size: extremely small individual cell size Chromosomes: non-membrane bound DNA is circular and lacks proteins Cell division and genetic recombination Simple division via binary fission True sexual reproduction absent, genetic recombination irregular Internal compartmentalization: Lack membrane-bound organelles Enzymes are bound to cell membrane Only organelles present are ribosomes Flagella: possess simple flagella fig 30.1a,c,13 Composed of single flagellin fiber Lack 9 + 2 structure of eukaryotic flagella and cilia fig 5.26 Flagellar motion resembles spinning propeller, not whip-like motion Metabolic Diversity: Eukaryotes exhibit only one form of photosynthesis Bacteria exhibit several patterns of photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic Bacteria undergo chemosynthesis and fix atmospheric nitrogen BACTERIAL STRUCTURE Cell Wall Structure Polysaccharide network with polypeptide crosslinks fig 30.14 Classed as gram-positive or gram-negative Gram-positive composed of polysaccharide network Gram-negative have additional lipopolysaccharide chains Gram-negative are less susceptible to antibiotics May be surrounded by gelatinous capsule General Morphology Cell shape Rod-shaped: bacilli Spherical: cocci Spirally coiled: spirilla Some form stalked structures that give rise to spores fig 30.11d After division individual cells may adhere forming chains Cyanobacteria regularly form large filamentous masses fig 30.12 Connected by outer walls or gelatinous sheaths May exhibit coordinated gliding or rotational movements Rigid, helical flagella composed of flagellin protein fig 5.8 Hairlike pili function in attachment and identification fig 30.13 Thick-walled endospores fig 30.15 Resistant to desiccation Resistant to heat, killed only by extremely high temperatures BACTERIAL VARIATION Mutation One in 200 bacteria will have mutant characteristics fig 30.16 Many mutants result from great number of individual cells Rapid multiplication in short time period Increase number with favorable mutations Rapidly changes characteristics of a population Plays important role in genetic diversity Example: development of antibiotic resistance Genetic Recombination Transfer of genes via viruses, plasmids, other DNA fragments Examples Rapid transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids Transfer of pathogenic characteristics among enteric bacteria Rapid generation time is an alternative evolutionary strategy BACTERIA AS PLANT PATHOGENS Cause Costly Plant Diseases Symptoms are generally spots on stems, leaves or fruit Include blights, soft rots and wilts Most pathogens are rod-shaped pseudomonads fig 30.11a Example: Citrus Canker Caused by pseudomonad Xanthomonas campestris Introduced from abroad, causes serious economical damage in Florida BACTERIA AS HUMAN PATHOGENS Cause Many Human Diseases tbl 30.1 Examples: cholera, leprosy, tetanus, bacterial pneumonia, whooping cough, diphtheria Generally related to one of several genera Streptococcus: pneumonia, scarlet and rheumatic fevers fig 30.1b Staphylococcus: cause widespread infections Many bacterial diseases spread through food or water Insect vectors spread diseases like typhus Humans can contract disease from drinking cow milk, causes brucellosis in animals Tuberculosis One-third of all people worldwide infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Eight million new cases each year, three million deaths Leading cause of death from a single infectious agent Eradication programs dismantled in U.S. in 1980's Experiencing a dramatic resurgence of the disease Complicated by social factors, declining public health infrastructure Associated with prevalence of HIV Multidrug resistant strains of TB are developing Dental Caries Causes tooth decay and cavities Dental plaque composed of bacteria and polysaccharide matrix Involves many species of bacteria High sugar diets harmful Bacteria convert sugars to lactic acid Acid destroys hard tissue of tooth Control via fluoride by retarding loss of calcium Sexually Transmitted Diseases STDs caused by bacteria and viruses Viral STDs have no cure Bacterial STDs \nfrequently mutate to drug-resistant strains Gonorrhea Most prevalent communicable disease, cause by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium Transmitted during sexual activities through transfer of body fluids Can spread to eyes (conjunctivitis) and internal organs, cause arthritic meningitis Symptoms in women and men are generally mild and go unnoticed Treatment via combination of antibiotics Syphilis Less common as a result of blood-screening procedures and antibiotic treatment Caused by spirochaete bacterium, Treponema palladum Transmitted during intercourse, direct contact with sore or from mother to fetus Disease progresses in four distinct stages Primary stage characterized by chancre sore, highly infectious stage Secondary stage distinguished by body rash Third stage shows no symptoms, may last years Fourth stage is heart disease, mental deficiency, nerve damage, loss of motor functions, blindness Treated via antibiotics Genital herpes Caused by two types of closely related viruses Herpes simplex Type 1 causes cold sores and fever blisters Herpes simplex type 2 causes genital lesions of genital herpes Transmitted through sexual contact when open sores are evident Herpes virus in body travels along nerve endings to base of spine May remain dormant with no symptoms May become active and produce painful symptoms Initial outbreak produces measle-like lesions, flu-like symptoms May become dormant, outbreaks reappear with stress or exposure to sun Antiviral drugs can lessen severity of outbreaks, not a cure Transmission possible during outbreaks Chlamydia \"Silent STD\" caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium Has both bacterial and viral characteristics Susceptible to antibiotics like bacterium Depends on host cell to replicate, like virus Transmitted via sexual intercourse Women usually do not experience symptoms until infection is established Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease Can lead to sterility, increase risk of acquiring HIV Symptoms in men include watery discharge, burning or itching Tests exist to identify bacteria in discharge Treatment via antibiotics mostly tetracycline, penicillin not effective Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Transmission through contact with infected person fig 30.17 More than 30 strains, three known to cause cervical cancer Warts appear in genital region three weeks to three months after exposure Treatment through various agents to remove warts Archaebacteria and Eubacteria Archaebacteria are distinctly different from all other bacteria Base sequences of rRNA virtually identical in all members Differ from sequences in other bacteria and eukaryotes Cell walls lack muramic acid Have distinctive membranes, unusual cell walls, unique metabolic cofactors Capable of living in anaerobic atmosphere rich in CO2 and H2 Include oldest life forms, ancestral to Eubacteria and eukaryotes Independent evolution of each group Some have ribosomes similar to eukaryotes Others have smaller ribosomes like Eubacteria Include methanogens that produce methane gas Produce marsh gas, natural gas and reduce elemental sulfur Produce own anaerobic environment, cannot function in presence of oxygen Include other bacteria able to survive in inhospitable environments Thermoacidophiles

connective tissue that contains Blood vessels Peyer's patches (lymph nodes) in the submucosa - protect us from disease muscularis - smooth muscle layer - 2 layers of smooth muscle - inner = encircles the Gut - outer layer - longitudinal layer lies in the same direction as the gut serosa - serous membrane layer - thin outermost layer of squamous epitheliurn Supported by connective tissue Serosa secretes serous fluid that keeps the outer surface of the intestines moist So that the organs of the abdominal cavity slide against one another Outer layer of the esophagus is composed only of loose connective tissue Called adventitia Stomach - sac-like organ composed of the fundus (upper,rounded part ), body (main portion), and antrum (lower part) Rugae - as in the mouth, are folds in the mucosal lining Glands within the rugae secrete gastric juices that aids in digestion and forms a Protective coating on the lining of the stomach pylorus - narrow passage which connects the stomach with the small intestine Pyloric sphincter - muscle that controls the flow between the stomach and the Duodenum Columnar epithelium has gastic pits which lead to gastric glands, produce gastric juice Gastric juice contains pepsin - digests protein Also HCI and mucous HCI - gives the stomach its acidity - pH =2 which helps kill most bacteria Present in food, it does not digest food but does break down Connective tissue found in meat and activates pepsin Mucous secreted by the goblet cells protects the stomach lining from the acidity If the HCI penetrates the mucous, the wall can begin to break down - it is now believed That Helicobacter pylon (bacteria) impairs the ability of epithelial cells to Produce the protective mucous Stomach absorbs alcohol but not food - food leaves the stomach as a thick soupy Liquid called chyme - chyme leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine Small Intestines - small bowel - extends from the stomach to the large intestines 3 parts: Duodenum 1 st portion - from the pylorus to the jejunum Jejunum - middle portion - from the duodenum to the ileum Ileum - last portion - from the jejunum to the cecum of the large intestine Ileocecal vale - between the ileum and the large intestines - prevents backflow of waste Controlled by ileocecal sphincter Bile is secreted into the small intestine from the liver and pancreatic juice is secreted into the small intestine from the pancreas - bile emulsifies fat Into droplets to disperse in water pH of the small intestine is slightly basic to neutralize the chyme enzymes from the pancreas help complete the digestion process The surface area of the wall of the small intestine is approximately that of a tennis court due to fingerlike projections called villi and additional projections called microvilli this is for maximum absorption of nutrients into the cardiovascular (glucose and fatty acids) system and lymphatic (fats) system Regulation of digestive hormones: Although the nervous system plays a part in the secretion of digestive juices - so do hormones hormones - substance produced by one set of cells that affects a different set of cells Called target cells if one eats a meal rich in protein - stomach produces the hormone gastrin - enters the Bloodstream - soon the stomach begins churning, and the secretory activity of Gastric glands increases duodenal wall produces GIP (gastric inhibiting peptide) - works opposite from gatrin To inhibit gastrin secretion Also secretes secretin - whose release is stimulated by the HCI in the chyme And CCK - cholecystokinin - whose release is stimulated by partially Digested protein and fats Once \nthese hormones enter the bloodstream - the liver begins secreting bile into The small intestine and pancreas begins secreting pancreatic juices into The small intestine Large Intestine - from the small intestine to the anus 4 parts: Cecum - pouch that lies on the right side of the abdomen - from the ileum to the Colon Colon -3 parts: Ascending colon - cecum to the undersurface of the liver Transverse colon - passes horizontally to the left towards the Spleen Descending colon- travels down the left side of the abdominal Cavity to the signioid cavity Sigmoid colon ~3rd major part of the large intestine - from the descending colon To the rectum Rectum - last division of the large intestine Anus - lower opening of the gastrointestinal tract 2 anal sphincter muscles control the anus Defecation is the expulsion of feces - 3 quarters water, and ~ quarter solids The color is caused by the bilirubin and the odor is produced by the breaking Down of products as the bacteria work on the undigested material obligate anaerobes are the main bacteria present in the large intestine --they break Down undigestive food and produce vitamins and other molecules the large Intestine absorbs polyps - colon can develop polyps - small growths arising from the epithelial lining - can be Benign or cancerous - are surgically removable researchers believe increased fat intake can lead to cancer because of the increase in Bile secretion caused by fat also - increase in fiber intake decreases the chances of colon cancer - fiber absorbs water and adds bulk - diluting the concentration of bile salts and facilitating the Movement of substances through the intestine Regular elimination decreases the intestines exposure to cancer promoting Agents diarrhea - caused by infections of the lower tract and nervous stimulation each case the intestinal wall is stimulated due to irritation or nervous stimulation Peristalsis increases and water is not absorbed - resulting in diarrhea constipation - feces are dry and hard - many times resulting from one ignoring the urge to Defecate increased water and fiber intake can help prevent constipation Liver - located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (hepatic - pertaining to the liver) functions: Removes excess glucose from the bloodstream and stores it as glycogen Converts glycogen back to glucose when needed Destroys old erythrocytes (red blood cells) Removes poisons from the blood Manufactures some blood proteins Manufactures bile, digestive juices (stored on the gallbladder) Bilirubin is also released by the liver into the bile Removes bilirubin from the blood Produces lipids from fatty acids - produces and helps regulate cholesterol Produces urea from the breakdown of amino acids Stores iron and the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,and K) Jaundice - when bilirubin is deposited in the skin due to an abnormally large amount in The blood - person has yellowish tint to the whites of the eyes and the skin Hepatitis - inflammation if the liver - several forms of viral hepatitis A - get from sewage contaminated drinking water B - spread by sexual contact, blood transfilsions or contaminated needles More contagious than AIDS virus (Vaccine available) C - acquired by contact with infected blood - leads to chronic hep or liver cancer Cirrhosis -

types of water pollution: Disease-carrying agents: bacteria, viruses, protozoa, parasitic worms that enter the water from domestic sewage and animal wastes Oxygen-demanding wastes: organic wastes which can be aerobically decomposed by bacteria DO (dissolved oxygen) - oxygen content BOD (biological oxygen demand) - amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic decomposers to break down the organic material in a certain volume of water over a 5-day period Inorganic plant nutrients: water-soluble nitrate and phosphate compounds that can cause excess growth of algae and aquatic vegetation Organic chemicals: oil, gasoline, plastics, pesticides, cleaning solvents, detergents and many other water-soluble and insoluble chemicals Sediment or suspended matter: insoluble particles of soil and other solid inorganic and organic materials Radioactive substances: radioisotopes that are water soluble or capable of being biologically amplified to higher concentrations as they pass through food chains and webs Heat: excess input of water that is heated - used mostly to cool electrical power plants Sources of pollution: Point: pollution discharged at specific locations through pipes, ditches, or sewers into bodies of surface waterNonpoint: big land areas that discharge pollutants into surface and underground waters Stream and river pollution - usually recover rapidly from heat and oxygen-demanding wastes due to flow - often not a major concern - cities get their drinking water upstream and discharge sewage downstream Lake pollution - less flow for dilution and mixing - stratification prevents mixing, resulting in excess nutrient loading - cultural eutrophication - input of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) accelerated by human activities Prevention methods: use advanced waste treatment to remove phosphates from effluents ban or set low limits on phosphates for detergents and cleaning products control land uses, use sound soil conservation practices protect coastal and inland wetlands that filter and retain nutrients Cleanup Methods: dredge bottom sediments to remove excess nutrients remove or harvest excess weedscontrol nuisance plants with herbicides and algicidespump air through lakes to avoid oxygen depletion Ocean pollution: the ultimate sink for much of the waste matter produced can dilute, disperse, and degrade large amounts of sewage, sludges, oil, and some types of industrial waste, especially in deep waters marine organisms tend to be more resilient to exposure about 2 million birds and 100,000 marine mammals die when they ingest or become entangled in plastic cups, bags, six-pack yolks, nets, ropes, and other forms of trash 80% dredge spoils - materials scraped from the bottoms of harbors and shipping channels 20% sewage sludges - mixture of toxic chemicals, infectious agents, and settled solids removed from wastewater at sewage treatment plants Oil pollution: most actually comes from waste oils disposed onto the lands by individuals, industries, and cities - tanker accidents and well blowouts most visible but account for only about 20% Groundwater pollution: most groundwater is renewed so slowly that any contamination may be considered permanent natural removal of bacteria and suspended solid particles as water percolates through soils into aquifers slow flow, cold temperatures, and lack of oxygen greatly extends time from wastes to degrade Preventing contamination may be the only effective way to protect groundwater by banning virtually all disposal of hazardous wastes in sanitary landfills and injection wells monitoring of existing landfills and wells for leakage placing stricter controls on chemical applications establishing national groundwater standards Controlling surface water pollution: Nonpoint source: primarily agricultural - reduce excess fertilizer and pesticide use, control feedlot runoff, reforest watersheds Point source: wastewater lagoons - large ponds where air, sunlight, and microorganisms can break down wastes septic systems primary sewage treatment - mechanical screening of debris such as sticks, stones, rags secondary sewage treatment - aerobic bacteria degrade and remove up to 90% of biodegradable oxygen-demanding organic waste advanced sewage treatment - specialized chemical and physical processes that lower the quantities of specific pollutants US Water Pollution Control Laws Safe Drinking Water Act (1974): required EPA to establish maximum contamination levels for any pollutant that \"may\" have adverse effects on human health: 97 cause cancer, 82 mutations, 28 toxic, 23 promote tumors - by 1993 only 84 of 700+ set Federal Water Pollution Act of 1972 (renamed the Clean Water Act of 1977) and 1987 Water Quality Act: established to control pollution of surface waters required EPA to set standards for effluents and monitoring water quality as a result most cities now have secondary sewage treatment facilities SOLID AND HAZARDOUS

in 1991 DO IT FOR LOVE (Slavens, Muller, Brand, Emert) baby you can rob a bank or hold up a 7-11 you can shoplift merchandise and still buy your way into heaven all you need is a valid excuse they'll tell you it's a sin to steal but you're only as guilty as you feel just don't do what the bad people do you can get away with anything if you do it for love you can get away with anything if you do it but just make sure you're doing it you can get away with anything if you do it for love absolution comes from within but love alone can save your soul from sin just don't do what the bad people do do it for love and only for love not for money or for power or some God up above no judge or jury ever can convict you, son I WAS CONFUSED (ABOUT THE TELEVISION SET) (Slavens, Muller, Brand) I watched the news just the other day and there's just one thing that I must say it gave me a pain right in the middle of my head the newsman came on with his face and told me about the big disgrace let me know just how many people got dead and I got down, it brought me down so I got up and turned it off that left me alone with my thoughts and a great big pain right in the middle of my head and I was confused I didn't know what to do I watched a show just the other night and I must say something was not right how come people on television's weird in the head well they won't show sex but they show a lot of killing guess it must be better to show blood spilling than to let little junior see two naked people in bed EAST COAST JONES (Slavens) back home it's the same things are very slow to change by the time the news comes in from L.A. the latest fad is already passe (hey, hey) the clothes and the music and the latest phrase tomorrow has the reek of yesterday everybody wants to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play back here it's the same everything is up to date they say build it up, buy it up, eat it up fast it's made for looks but it ain't made to last buy a nice house buy a nice car junior executives born to be a star if you want \nto be in fashion you'll have to pay the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play out there it's the same except there ain't nobody knows your name 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'you can run but you can never hide' well you see all the same rules will still apply you'll still get low you know you'll still get high everybody runs to keep up with the east coast Jones and the west coast way to play CRAWL (Slavens) crawl into another head stand up take a look around - tell me what you see crawl into another head now, when I was a baby I just couldn't understand why everybody didn't think like I did and it messed with my head it took me years to overcome it but I finally did when I took a little trip in someone else's head now, everybody tells me that I gotta have a world view well I listen very carefully but I don't always know what to do there's a lot of bogus causes phony ideologies but if you pick yourself the right one you can set your spirit free now, I am on the right side maybe you are on the left side and we're looking at the same thing but we're looking at it differently I guess I'm talking about perspective but it's different from that if you can walk around with someone else's brain under your hat it's a very simple reason and a lot of people learn it but a lot of people close their minds to certain information they are trying to avoid any unwanted stimulation that might make them reevaluate the values that they live by CASTLE ON THE HILL (Slavens) gotta wonder how you sleep at night with the front door locked and the windows drawn up tight in your castle up on the hill baby, baby, do you know what I mean there's a great big world that I know you've never seen from your castle up on the hill You built it brick by brick and locked yourself inside you're sitting safe in a great big fortress but I don't know what you're hiding from I guess you're worried that you might find out that you've been missing what your life is all about while you're sitting in your castle on the hill if you ask me you're just a victim of your own devices money and security will not suffice go out and get a real life break out of the castle on the hill THE BUFFALO CLUB (Slavens) I don't belong to the Buffalo Club but I sure would like to wake up in the morning and find out it's all been a terrible dream does anybody see it as a warning have you been out there on the street pretty lights above your head pretty bricks beneath your feet clean off the spray paint on the walls clean the kids and clean their minds until there's nothing left to clean except the sky have you been checking out the changes I hear so many names I see so many different faces all the suffering from the same disease did you find out young that life is short and try to take the easy way out there's no easy way out how I wish that I could be naive I long to be taken in tricked into believing again OLD EYES (Slavens) I met you in an earlier time we had just one thing in common that was the only thing in my life I remember that one spring day when we drove out in the country flying past houses, farms and fields I would give anything to be with you again I would give anything to hear you call my name I would give anything to see your smiling face to see you with my old eyes that wasn't so long ago when we were both quite naive oh the things that I believed I remember the summer with you when we lived out in the country so much life and so much time time is changing now my life is rearranged there's so much trouble we got lost I could not find you had to leave you far behind but I will be with you again ALLIGATOR BRAIN (Slavens, Muller) taste of blood on my lips cold spot in my heart man of action plan of action no reaction cold spot in my heart there's a cold spot in my heart if I love you I can hurt you cold spot in my heart everything that you say can be used in a cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart the knife cuts my heart bleeds please don't push me baby, there's a cold spot in my heart just can't be responsible for tearing you apart when I'm in my alligator brain I see my chance I make my move got a cold spot I've got a cold spot in my heart once I'm in motion there is no devotion just one cold emotion cold spot in my heart I've got a cold spot in my heart LOVE IS THE QUESTION (Slavens) love is the question that my heart's been asking and you are the answer every night I go to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep if I have to climb a thousand mountains high I will be there for you, baby I will show you how to fly yeah, yeah, yeah won't you do it once for me cover me with kisses, baby YEAH RIGHT (Slavens, Muller) everybody's driving in their cars everybody's telling me \nboy you've gotta be a big star I don't listen to what they say I just concentrate on having a nice day and I say hey, hey, hey get outta my face changes coming 'round soon enough gonna put you all in your place so get yourself a job that pays real good find yourself a house in a nice neighborhood get some money in the bank and nothing bad will happen don't worry about the nightly news somebody else has got the blues you're on top and you can't lose nothing bad will happen ...yeah, right as it was it is and shall be evermore don't be too concerned about what the future has in store cuz you don't want to change it anyway well, this is how you dig it so this is how it stays and I say whoa, whoa, whoa maintain the status quo and don't tell me about changes, baby I don't want to know CAST OUT YOUR DEMONS (Slavens) everybody's talking talking all about you don't pretend that you don't know seems you got a problem you don't have to be too smart to guess it right on the nose something's got the better of you and it's sticking to your life like gum on your shoe Everybody's worried worried all about you wondering when you're gonna explode don't be too surprised if they all stand back and leave you alone to carry the load something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you you better cast out your demons everybody loves you everybody still cares about you even when you push them away but hey we're all human and you'll push it to the limit you'll wake up alone some day something's got the better of you you better take care of it before it takes care of you I know it's gonna be hard but you better cast out your demons BYE-BYE (Slavens) I had a dream a particular scene though now it gets hard to remember you looked so real as you sat at the wheel the air smelled of early December I heard the sound of your voice remember Luanne I heard the sound of your voice say to me... bye-bye hope you remember my name when I'm gone bye-bye don't really know if it meant anything but I feel like a better man today it sounded so true that I knew it was you though I can't recall what you were saying if I was there you didn't seem to care when you spoke you were looking right through me I left school and I guess things got cool between you and our person in common but he was there too he went through it with you who's to say which one came out better UNDERWATER (Slavens, Muller, Brand, Emert) air all around but no water to be found I dance around but the surroundings don't suit me I'm looking for a familiar face I'm reaching for something but I don't know I'm on the outside now I'd love to get back in again I never should have jumped just lack of self discipline and I long to be back underwater once I was so safe and sound just floating all around and there was nothing much to do or see but I long to be back underwater All lyrics by Paul Slavens

Dinner is served it s quite a long time ago there lived a man who ran a restaurant he served people as meat for his costumers to eat they ate dead bodies with hunger and appetite to keep the growing demand he killed people day and night men were served as collared beef and women in the various types of meat he used theirs guts for ages as forcement for his sausages the people are getting weaker because fo lunch they ate some died on ptomaine poisoning from the dinner he made he puts them into the meatgrinding machine incarnation now begins he stripped the flesh from theis bones and prepared them at home because of the stench of roasting flesh in his human butchery he was sentenced to death and he will be served as meat his pulverised torso is garnished with fruits and vegetables for dish his hot grilled body is going to be backed in numerous pieces with a rusty axe put his shreds into plastic bags sell him as meat for the hungry people to eat Trash chunk and garbage the years of decay are now already past my pulverised torso is even marked with disgust maggots infeat my coffin and decomposition sets in lying and rotting in my own secretions this may be the first sign or putrefaction as i awake in my grave an whip the maggots from my face Masked killer welcome to death house no one gets out of it alive my family has four members we re hungry for flesh the dinning room is painted with blood the candelier is hanged with guts my face is so ugly that s why i need your skin your mutilated bones will be wore as pins we gnaw the flesh from your bones it s a fine meal for us alone chilli is made from human guts we devour it chunk for chunk Flesh is what i need once there were only remains a corpse without a form no skin and hair just naked flesh too weak to gasp for air i can t even move myself my legs are still too weak to get back my human figure i make a fiendish pact \nyou kill for me and i won t eat you so do your job do it now and do it good i sent out instructions to kill and bring me the bodies - brutally slaughtered to quench my thirst i drink their blood from the thorax with a cup - freshly consumed heads are hammerd fingers slices off flesh is stripped from the bone - brutally slaughtered open stomach tons of guts celebration with fresh blood - aaarrrggghhh a pick axe flies through the air penetrating the man s chest blood pumps from the fatal womb and the gore continues to spurt Satisfaction in the morgue the lovely smell of rot and decay cold and dead bodies are moulding away the naked cadavers don t drive me to disgust in the morgue i like to satisfy my lust i can t resist temptation icecold bodies morbid satisfaction i m so excited because i never did it before i enjoy this beautiful smell and cry for more secretion of

happened again and again today] as the bus reached Burleigh Heads the bus didn't stop the driver saying this isn't a mandatory stop every other time I have travelled to work it has been I was told on one occasion that I never had to indicate the driver as this was a mandatory stop I got off wondering what was going on here, the bus was then on its way to Tweed Heads with the driver mentioning this

do it, at morning tea the lunch lady called me \"Les\" [Les is a 55 year old cabinetmaker] she the said \"I always get you and Les mixed up\" I thought that is a nasty thing to say to a person, I wonder who orchestrated this, after morning tea I felt dizzy and groggy for some time [feeling a shock inside my forehead] I only had some chips for morning tea and this happens every time I have chips from this shop, I was given a new tape measure from Greg, in the afternoon another one of the cabinetmakers came to me very arrogantly after some board cut when I told him that there wasn't any

to charge the \"Public Holiday rate\" I thought this was profiteering as it wasn't a Public Holiday as I got to work Dave C was there yet there was no sign of Simon Dave didn't have the keys to get in and we waited outside until 7.35am when Simon arrived on picking up my very wet bag which wasn't very heavy I noticed that the muscles in my left shoulder and back was very sore feeling like I had strained them yet I hadn't done any thing for this to happen, walking into the factory I noticed that Dace P had cut a job yesterday as well as changed the settings on the saw by my tape measure it was cutting 2 millimetres under size and was out of alignment I tried cutting some board with very bad results the board end being 3 millimetres narrower on one end, I thought how am I going to cut anything with the saw like this I couldn't believe it, this aggravated me as I know Dave can do better then this, I changed a few things then kept working yet all morning I wasn't very happy at all [interfered with for curtain] Dave C came up to the saw a few times where I was working with his head down looking he had a guilty conscientious at 11am Simon came up to me saying that's enough for today having a little talk to me about getting the kitchens out faster saying the cabinetmaker had gotten themselves into a rut and weren't doing there work as well as they have done in the past and that Greg wasn't happy with the output in the factory and a few other things, I walked to Treetops where I had a capichino and fillet of fish from Macdonalds then went to wait for the bus where a

getting off a few stops before me and far before Burleigh this is where I got the bus to Southport after spending a few minutes on the beach on this trip there were many woman all with fair hair who got on the bus smiling at me [again I thought what's going on here this doesn't usually happen] once back in my room I went out and did a few hours work on my car putting the cylinder head, camshaft housing, exhaust manifold, some water hoses, oil filter, timing belt, battery, and a few other things on my car, this was after noticing that the other car that was to be removed from the premises was gone, fear took over my body after I washed up and had a coffee I walked to coles where I did some shopping there were there were many woman in tight jeans and very well groomed who were looking at me I thought what's going on here I haven't had a shower or a hair cut for some time and look awful, arrogant whistling in hallway just after I got back into my room and just as Sports Tonight started I thought this is usually what happens when something is just about to happen or after something has been done, at about 6pm I tried having a sleep yet couldn't get into any sort of sleep after the work I had done today, I was also very impotent with my penis muscles feeling contracted there was no sperm whatsoever, all my muscles were stiff and sore and again I was thinking over and over about my car \"so you think its going to \nstart it will never see the road again\" with the feeling of fear [interference with my emotions] and \"just remember one is perfect\" [fuel prices up by $0.07 a

all the emission control and vacuum hoses that I could needing to allow glue to dry after breaking some plastic fittings, I took the old spark plugs out, fitted the alternator drive belt, carburettor and base plate, and fitted the fuel hose, hope it goes now, after finishing this I picked up my washing from the laundry and went inside I had intended going to Southport yet felt that exhausted and lifeless I needed to lie down falling off to sleep for a short time and had a dream about being shoot by the Police while relaxing in a park there were many shoots fired another Police Officer who had been shoot in the fire gave me a gun so I could protect myself once the Officer had run out of bullets he run off to a nearby Police Station as his car was damaged informing the sergeant at the station that he had been fired apon and there was an officer down I attended to the officer who had been shoot and myself when a barrage of Police Officers arrived arresting me with bodily force then released me after wounded officer told his recollection of events, on looking for the bullet that past through me I found it outside the nearby AMP office which was across the road from the park and bay with coral over the beach, that was some dream, tonight I kept thinking again about my car not starting \"this time it was the starter motor that isn't going to work\" then \"what will you do if

for a few minutes, then the saying \"there you go and the number 16 was said\" then I got 16.50 change the saying \"there you go\" once again I thought now I do know what's going here thinking of Karen Canon and why would I go there with what they have cost me not only financially but life style, and standard of living, I ate my burger then walked to Super Cheap Auto where everywhere I walked in the store there were males hounding me I couldn't get away from them, I them walked to Burleigh where I walked to the beach then caught the bus the Southport where I shopped at coles then went to

ever had telling jokes then laughing and snorting very loudly I complained about the lack of service and he said his monitor showed there was another taxi at the rank, I got to work about 5 minutes late Dave was at the saw and he said \"what seems to be the problem\" I thought how would he know there was a problem I didn't tell anyone yet had plenty of thoughts about what he did to the saw, then I told him that it just doesn't work for me he said \"that's the way it got to be\" I thought what's he talking about after the weekend I have had, brain dead all day I could hardly return any comments to anything anyone said to me, and when I said hello to everyone I couldn't remember some of there names, during the day I really had know idea what I was doing couldn't communicate well

you next time\" my speach was that slurred she couldn't understand what I was saying, I then went to the library where I looked at a car book as I was doing this I started thinking \"you'll never ever get a woman like that I'll make sure of that\" then thought of \"Terasa Rubbo, Teraesa Williams, and Karen Cannon\" this is almost an every day thing now yet not all day or at any set time, I looked up and there was actually a woman sitting in frunt of me, then thought how could that happen when I get hit by the equivilent to nuclear \nweaponry every day which not only make me uninterested but

Horners Syndrome my chemical balance was very bad I couldn't see any red blood cells in my hands, my genitals were completely impotent with my penis muscles contracted, seized brain which was evident all day, trauma, trauma today [I kept on thinking \"you watch what's going to happen next\"] arogant whistling in hallway after this, went, thinking of Dave from work on many occasions, watched \"The

about 10.30am feeling very fixed and seized still with a sharp pain in my forehead felt very fragile, unmotivated, depressed, groggy, my mind was rambling over and over again specially about getting my car going, I did entend doing some work on my car today and hopefully get it running yet I really feared going outside to do this [these feelings just aren't my normal feelings or personality] at 1pm I got everything together to go out to my car and it started pouring with rain and kept raining almost all afternoon, after about an hour I went for a walk to Southport where I walked around like a zombie and very groggy and right out of it, my brain had enormus trouble decoding any thing then understanding it was almost imposible, while writing this it took massive brain power to spel words then I had no idea if these were the words I was looking for, my mind was also rambling while walking I noticed that I had no red blood cells in my hands [the only part of my body that I could really see] had no idea what to do with my body today I couldn't sit still and was unable in standing for any period I felt like I had an adiction to something which I was in need of there were cramps and pain throughout my body, this weekend like last weekend I have been extended far beyond the limitations of the human body, tonight thinking \"you'll never get that car started\" then thinking of Elwin

Gold Coast Highway, the only thing that went my way was it started to pour with rain as soon as I got inside the factory, all day my eyes were very dark unable in reading my tape meature very well, my temperturer control was non exsitant with my head boiling hot most of the day yet still wasn't sweating, I really had know idea what I was doing my mind changing jobs when I was on one job and my memory was unable to retain any thought of what I was doing, everyone at work today were very quite and took \nmany hours before they got back to normal, after work I walked to Treetops on the way as I got to Rudman Road my vision became very norrow with spots I couldn't see anything outside of a square metre without moving my head directly to what I wanted to see, after about 20 minutes my brain couldn't decode anything even simple words I had know idea of there meaning or even if I had the right word for the meaning or if I was saying the right word, at this time my mind became very active with a lot of garbage non of my thoughts believe me they weren't yet I have no recolection of what they were about now, as I got on the bus the driver kept me waiting while he talked the someone this is the second time he has done this and I have only had him twice his name was \"Dennis\" during the trip I kept thinking again \"you still don't think you can get your car going do you\" \"not a chance that car will go with what we have done to it you just don't understand do you\" after getting off the bus at Southport I went to post office where I found a parcel from my sister sue \"a box

appear on face, all day my eyes were stinging my head was hot feeling anemic with my body feeling it had no engine with no part of my body operating anywhere near a reasonable level at about 9am I

explosives A team of British scientists has discovered a yeast-like bacterium that feasts on many types of explosives , including Semtex, nitroglycerine and TNT It is now being genetically modified to degrade the whole range of explosives that various armies and manufacturers around the world want to get rid of The search has been on for some time to find a more environmentally friendly way of getting rid of explosives , and a team at the University of Cardiff has now created what it calls a bacteria bomb squad When bombs, shells and mines are no longer wanted it is possible to separate the explosive material from the case by washing it out with high-pressure water Modern explosives and propellants are usually nitrate based The Cardiff team has found and isolated a soil-based bacterium that simply \"eats\" the explosives by degrading the nitro Dr Graham White, who led the research, says: \"Bacteria need carbon and nitrogen for growth and these explosives are rich in nitro-organics - for some bacteria they represent a good source of nitrogen White and his team set about the task by taking samples of soil, river water and sewage sludge and adding each of them to flasks containing mineral salts but with no source of nitrogen other than the nitro groups of old explosives By constantly diluting the flasks, the team was eventually able to isolate and identify the bacterium with a taste for an explosive diet The bacterium degrades the explosives down to natural compounds and minerals Depending on the amount of explosives , it can degrade materials in hours The Cardiff team has found the gene sequence of the bacterium and is able to use DNA technology to force its evolution so that it can be encoded to eat all types of explosives 2 .",0.5809242129325867],["Some bacteria can
