Chapter Twenty-Eight Extended Lecture Outline Chapter 28 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline HUMANITY VERSUS THE EARTH Effects of Human Population Visible at Great Distance fig 28.1 Population Impacts the Environment Total population of the earth in 1995 reached 5.7 billion More people consume more food, water, energy and raw materials More people create greater amount of waste A GROWING POPULATION Historical Perspective Earliest fossils from Europe are 500,000 years old Humans spread to North America 12,000 years ago Population 10,000 years ago was only 5 million With agriculture, populations rapidly expanded More dependable sources of food fig 28.2 Development of towns and cities Bubonic plague in 1348 killed nearly four-fifths of population fig 28.3 Recovery and increase to 500 million by 1650 Seventeenth century Renaissance renewed interest in science Scientific developments led to Industrial Revolution The Present Situation Global birth rate for last 300 years: 30 per year per 1000 people Present rate decreased slightly to 25 per 1000 Decreased death rate to 9 per 1000 people per year Net increase in annual population rate Population increasing \nat rate of 1.6% per year Will double population in 43 years Annual increase of 90 million per year Increase per minute of 170 people United Nation estimates population of 6 billion by 2000 AD Expected stabilization at 8.5 to 18 billion by 2090 Must stabilize population due to limited resources The Future Situation Localization of human populations in year 2000 60% in tropical or subtropical regions 20% in China 20% in developed or industrialized nations People in industrialized areas control 85% of wealth and materials Standard of living 20 times higher Lower infant mortality rate Higher life expectancy Variable world age structure affects population growth Industrialized nations: 20% of population under 15 years Developing countries have nearly twice as many fig 28.4 Populations of developing countries will continue to grow faster Industrialized nations will constitute smaller portion of the global population Quality of life dependent on stabilizing world`s population THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE Immediate World Challenge to Produce More Food Food production increased by 2.6 times since 1950 Population expanded at greater rate Most cultivatable land already in use Topsoil lost from agricultural land Consumption in developed countries increasing at greater rate Must Increase Agricultural Productivity Identify new crops, especially in tropics Major crops have been cultivated for thousands of years Few new plants cultivated since 1800 Examples: rubber and oil palms Crops selected for ease of growth Kinds of Agricultural Crops Three primary food crops: corn, wheat, rice 5000 types have ever been used for food, only 150 used regularly Various plants used for medical treatments Reasons for cultivating new plants Altered standards of cultivation Extraction of industrial products, oils, drugs, chemicals The Prospects for More Food Must increase productivity of current crops Improvement needed in tropical and subtropical regions Improvement of strains via Green Revolution: 1950-1970 Ten-fold increase in Mexican wheat production Food production in India outpaced population growth China became self-sufficient in food production Limitations of Green Revolution Agricultural techniques require great energy output Extensive use of costly pesticides and herbicides Commercial prices held low in developing areas Present solutions Improve production of current crops Not likely to bring more land into agricultural use Fully apply traditional means of plant breeding and selection fig 28.6 Include wheat, corn and rice Develop new crops in tropics and subtropics Develop improved strains via genetic engineering Resistance to specific herbicides results in better weed control Tolerance to soil conditions and mineral toxicity Ability to fix nitrogen Use of hydroponic agriculture problematic Resources of oceans are not inexhaustible Reduce over fishing of specific areas Develop new microorganism-based foods: Spirulina OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Nuclear Power Chernobyl incident One of four reactors exploded in April 1986 Emergency safety systems shut off Power surge precipitated the explosion Released over 100 megatons of radioactivity Millions of times greater than Three Mile Island Significant human exposure to radiation Death due to radiation poisoning The promise of nuclear power Fossil fuels no longer cheap sources of energy Nuclear power could provide new source Undesirable side effects to burning fossil fuels Produces sulfur and carbon dioxide New problems associated with nuclear power Safe operation of power plants Disposal of radioactive wastes Safe decommission of power plants Prevention of terrorism and sabotage Important to develop other alternative energy sources Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming CO2 in atmosphere maintains world temperature 25% higher than without it Traps heat-producing infrared light Creates greenhouse effect Associated with increased energy use Most gas from burning of fossil fuels Burning of forests also increases atmospheric gas Global warming results from increased CO2 Mean global temperature increased 1% since 1900 Masked by heat-absorbing capacity of oceans Level of CO2 could double by 2035 Warming exacerbated by trace gases Include chlorofluorocarbons Absorb infrared wavelengths better than CO2 Ancillary problems Rising sea levels Altered growth rates in plants Leads to global climate change Pollution Example: Rhine river Fire in chemical warehouse washed chemicals into river Deadly mercury and pesticides killed fish and plants Water became unsafe to drink River slowly cleaned itself The Threat of Pollution Results from industrial byproducts Plastics cannot decompose Efforts being made to develop new microorganisms yet unsuccessful Water pollution Not enough water to dispose of wastes Detergents increase algae, decrease water quality Agricultural pollution Widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers fig 28.7 Toxic chemicals remain in ecosystems Chlorinated hydrocarbons banned in U.S. Concentrate in the food chain Must develop responsible attitude toward use of chemicals Acid Precipitation Sulfur compounds produced when coal burned fig 28.8 Mixes with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid Acid dispersed by winds high up in atmosphere Effects seen far from where acids are produced Biological consequences Death of thousands of fresh water lakes fig 28.9 Seepage into groundwater Destruction of forests fig 28.10 Expensive to capture and remove emissions The Ozone Hole Visible to electronic equipment over Antarctica fig 28.11 Hole is nearly the size of the U.S. Thinning of ozone layer first appeared in 1975 Presence of hole coincides with Antarctic spring Cause of ozone hole attributed to chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) Chemicals used in cooling, fire extinguishers and styrofoam CFC`s reduce O3 ozone molecule to O2 gas Global agreements to halt CFC production Problem will get worse because of quantity currently in lower atmosphere that will reach upper atmosphere in later years Biological consequences Increased ultraviolet light penetration Increases incidence of human skin cancers Damage to photosynthetic plankton Destruction in the Tropics Traditional method of shifting agriculture fig 28.12 Crops grow for only a few years in poor soils Require decades without crops to rebuild nutrients High population density does not permit renewal No longer sufficient for even traditional manioc crop Dead materials collected for firewood, not recycled Forests being cleared at too great a rate Equal to the size of Indiana per year At the present rate they will be gone in thirty years Need to change from one-use to \ncontinuous agriculture fig 28.13 The Loss of Biodiversity Serious and rapidly accelerating problem Given the loss of species of known plants and animals Given the loss of habitat, especially in tropics Calculate loss of 20% of biodiversity within in next 30 years Loss greater considering we have named only 15% of world's eukaryotic organisms Loss important for several reasons Moral, ethical and aesthetic grounds Organisms necessary to sustain our own existence Opportunity to study them lost Also lose potential benefits of these organisms Upset balance of living communities and their physical environment Effect soils, water regulation, nutrient cycles, atmosphere and climate, absorb pollution Creating conditions of instability and unproductivity Little known about overall ecology of communities and ecosystems Cannot replace with systems that will support humans Damage is currently irreparable ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Attempts to Find Solutions to Environmental Problems Studied by environmental scientists Applied science associated with ecology, geology, meteorology Environmental Problems Can Be Solved fig 28.14 Assessment Gathering information Construct model of situation Use model to predict future events Risk analysis Analyze environmental impact Evaluate potential for solving problem Determine adverse effects of solution Public education Address problem in terms the public can understand Present alternative actions Explain costs and results of various choices Political action Choice made through elected officials Difficult to implement if multinational problems Follow-through Monitor results of environmental actions Evaluate and improve initial analysis and modeling WHAT BIOLOGISTS HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE Environmental Problems Require Applications of Biological Principles All living things need to use energy of the sun Need to understand basic principles and their applications Some areas of world are experiencing the future`s problems now Scientific Education Is Necessary for Informed Decision Making [Return to Chapter 28 Page]

suppose most people know that when i come to a place i have a bit of difficulty trying to say precisely what i'm going to be doing so i dont start with large introductions but as usual ive got a number of things on my mind when i go places and i think about them out loud in public and because what i'm doing is entertaining ideas not people i'm quite happy for people to feel free to get up and leave whenever they stop finding this entertaining and thats how i know i'm a poet not an entertainer though on several occasions people have compared me to entertainers like lenny bruce but thats not what i'm like i'm not very much like lenny bruce if i'm an entertainer at all i admire lenny bruce and have great respect for what he did but lenny bruce worked in clubs where he had \nto take on drunks and coax and coerce them into thinking about something more than getting laid while he kept them from getting out of the chair and hitting him or running away the difficulty is that he's there in that space where he's got to be entertaining even when he doesnt want to be in my case i always imagine i should put a sign over the door that reads ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE so that we could begin in a reasonable conversational way now recently ive been in a kind of conversation with a number of young artists and what weve been trying to figure out is what is a good way to think and talk about art and it seems that art has recently been accused of having ideas i know theres also a large contingent of people for whom art has no relation to ideas and exists only to express emotions but that idea is so stupid its hardly worth thinking about at all at the same time there are very serious and intelligent people who see an artwork as a container for ideas something like a suitcase or a blackboard on which the artist has inscribed in a more or less idiosyncratic script a message they could read out once theyve deciphered the handwriting so they study the handwriting and when they think theyve got it figured out they declare that this artwork says this and thinks that and they arrive at this notion because they believe that artists as relatively intelligent people having intentions and opinions declare them in their artworks like a traveler passing through customs i realized i'd never thought about artworks this way and i wondered whether or not it was at all reasonable to think so and around this time i happened to read something that made me think of this idea again i'd picked up a copy of the nation in the bathroom we keep our copies of the nation in the bathroom its a magazine we like to read when we're otherwise occupied because it has amusing political conversation though its otherwise totally absurd but it also has one intelligent person who writes about art a very cultivated and eloquent writer most of their other reviewers are worthless their film reviewer is silly their literary reviewers are ridiculous but they have an art writer named arthur danto who is an educated and sympathetic critic of contemporary art and he was writing a commentary on an exhibition by robert morris his retrospective at the guggenheim morris is an old friend of mine and as a result although i no longer like to write formal art essays i had been persuaded to contribute an essay to the catalog and because of currents of cliche in the contemporary art world i realized this exhibition was going to run into a generally unfriendly press so i was curious to see what arthur had to say the essay was disappointing it was only mildly affected by the negative currents of fashion but didnt get very far in talking about morris at all but in the course of the essay arthur quoted apparently with approval a statement from hegel from the esthetics a kind of sweeping statement you dont usually find quoted in art reviews which made a remarkable claim that an artwork is the embodiment of some truth now i'm not entirely sure what in this context would have counted for hegel or for danto as a truth and i'm not sure why we couldnt with equal confidence consider it the embodiment of a lie for which theres a great classical tradition in all those smooth bodied statues of young greeks and noble roman emperors and all those paintings of complaisantly luscious courtesans and handsome warriors but this doesnt really answer the question of what an embodiment of either a truth or a lie might really be it seems to imply at the very least that an artwork can be created as the physicalization of a very unphysical thing an idea and while there may be some difficulty in deciding exactly what an idea is the real problem i had with this claim was that i wasnt really sure how an obdurate object like an art work could be the physical manifestation of something as abstract as an idea now my first thought was that christians might understand this for christians jesus figures as the embodiment of an idea of god yet even for them this is a bit confusing because sometimes jesus is shown exercising divine powers doing miracles here and there casting out demons raising people from the dead but at other times his body and even his spirit appear to suffer all the pain and anguish of being human and abandoned on the cross and of course jesus is no more like an artwork than any other human being because his creation according to most dogmatic accounts is effected by human though miraculous means and this has been confusing even to orthodox christian theologians so it should be no surprise that personally i find it totally absurd but interesting and up to now its been the closest i'd ever come to understanding the notion of the embodiment of an idea but of course i never really understood it i never understood how anything as tangible as an artwork could embody anything as intangible and singular as an idea or a concept or a proposition \nor even a sequence of propositions though now that i think of it maybe i can imagine a kind of example something that comes close to it maybe an artwork thats a kind of machine a machine has a sequence of parts that are functionally related to each other like a series of propositions and you can follow them from part to part from an initial supposition to a determined end like a mousetrap a mousetrap is a simple machine its simple and lethal its there to kill mice and it works in an elegant way it consists of four basic parts a base a killing engine a bait platform and a restraining bar the base is simply a rectangular piece of wood the killing engine is an assembly consisting of a rectangular loop of metal wire anchored by one of the shorter legs to the center of the wooden base where the short leg acts as an axle for a spring thats slipped sleevelike around it pinning the opposite short leg of the looped wire down to one end of the wooden base the restraining bar is a straight piece of metal wire attached longitudinally by a loop at its end to a small metal hoop anchored at the other end of the base and the bait platform is a small cantilevered piece of plastic or metal mounted on an axle situated toward the center of the wooden base and within the pinned down wire loop in such a way that it can pivot up and down like a seesaw for the machine to be set to work some peanut butter is smeared on the bait platform the metal loop of the killing engine is pulled back down to the other end of the wooden base and pinned in place by the restraining bar the end of which is laid over it and hooked under a projecting element of the near leg of the cantilever elevating the bait smeared end of the platform which is held in place by the restraining bar under pressure from the spring exerted upon the short leg of the wire loop that is reciprocally held down by the restraining bar all thats required for the machine to work is the mouse a mouse is drawn by the smell of the peanut butter approaches the bait platform and tries tentatively to lick the butter in doing so it rests its head lightly on the raised end of the bait platform and this slight weight depresses the bait end of the platform pushes up the other end of the seesaw and frees the restraining bar which explodes upward releasing its downward pressure on the wire loop that the spring slams down on the mouse and breaks its neck in theory anyway and the theory is an exercise in logic if the mouse is drawn to the bait it tries to eat it licking the peanut butter depresses the end of the bait platform if this end of the cantilevered platform is depressed the other end is elevated if that end is elevated the restraining bar is released if the restraining bar is released the spring driven wire loop is forced up and explosively down onto the neck of the feasting mouse so the mousetrap is a chain of successive implications embodying a single truth desire leads to death at least from the point of view of the mouse but even from that perspective there are some uncertainties in the chain of implications first there is the question of the bait i dont pretend to be a zoologist but ive conducted numerous experiments and in my neighborhood there are two classes of mice peanut butter mice and jelly mice peanut butter mice have no desire for jelly and jelly mice have no desire for peanut butter this will not affect the theory but no mouse will come to the trap if i put out the wrong type of bait then there is the question of dining style a fastidious mouse may not rest its head upon the platform while delicately licking up the peanut butter or jelly the platform will not be depressed and the mouse will have its banquet in peace this might suggest that the mousetrap embodies a quite different truth like manners are a life and death matter or refinement can save your life but there are other variables that affect the unfolding logic of the mousetrap a clumsy mouse might jostle the wooden base with its paw knocking the restraining bar loose and springing the trap without ever entering it with the trap sprung the mouse can feast at leisure the truth this suggests may be god looks out for fools sometimes but then there are still other variables we live in california surrounded by geologic faults rock shelves move along the fault plane the earth shrugs lightly and the trap is sprung the truth no machine is fault free but this truth is manifested only occasionally and then the fault may be in me i may fix the restraining bar too firmly under the bait platform and it may never spring or too loosely and it springs almost immediately or the mouse is frightened and moves quickly back so that only its paw is caught in the trap and then i pick up the trap and set the wounded mouse free in the canyon in back of the house but these are all practical imperfections that can occur in the working of any machine and i suppose \nwe have to look for the idea the intention of the machine as embodied in its form the way we look at a vito acconci kinetic sculpture which rarely works but lets you figure out how it would work if all other things were equal still theres nothing in an acconci machine that suggests a logic as remorseless as a mousetrap which unfolds like the plot of a story so i suppose if you imagine an artwork thats built like a story but i cant think of many artworks that are very much like a story and even in a story it is a serious question whether the logic of its unfolding plot is the only or even the main meaning of it but this chain of events seems to mirror a sequence of purposes and actions intended to fulfill them and this movement from an intention to an end seems too single minded and purposeful for most artworks i know in fact i cant think of many artworks aside from leni riefenstahls films and roman imperial sculpture that are as goal oriented as this so maybe an artwork is not at all like a mousetrap maybe it doesnt embody any ideas at all maybe its more like a bowling ball that you roll toward ideas you know the ideas are out there somewhere and you roll this bowling ball towards them and it knocks over some of them and leaves other ideas standing or leaning against each other and i thought maybe thats the way it works and thats so wonderfully clear but i guess it depends on what kind of bowler you are i think i should point out that ive bowled only twice in my life and while i loved the setting i hated the sport half the time my ball went down the gutter at the side of the alley and missed all the pins but my incompetence aside maybe people are less purposive when they make artworks and a bowling alley is all purpose the pins are all stacked up neatly in front of you and the alley leads straight to them you pick up the ball and look right at the pins a bowling alley is all intention how often have you ever seen a bowler pick up the ball and roll it in another direction now as an artist ive never felt so purposive that it seemed i was looking down an alley at a bunch of ideas i wanted to knock down sometimes i felt like ideas were running in all directions and some of them were running by me and i was tempted to stick out my foot to see what might happen but it never felt as if i was leaning forward so directly into my intention still there are ways in which an artwork can be addressed to doing some particular thing formulating a paradox lets say that might be something like sticking your foot out into the smooth flow of traffic but theres another way in which you could make an artwork that would be something like the construction of a narrative a narrative not a story because i distinguish between narratives and stories this is a distinction of which aristotle and the french critical tradition as well as the american folkloric tradition are all ignorant because all theyre interested in is plot and as i see it a story is all about plot a story is the representation of a series of events and parts of events that result in a significant transformation its a logical form but a narrative is a representation of the confrontation of somebody who wants something with the threat and or promise of a transformation that he or she struggles to bring about or prevent or both these are two different cognitive modalities addressed to the problems posed to us by time because time is measured by change and change destabilizes all things especially human things because we're all temporary steady state systems who like to have to think of ourselves as stable in order to imagine ourselves as selves at all and theres only one philosopher i know whos thought about narrative this way and thats paul ricoeur when he's in his augustinian mode but then he falls back on aristotle and gets too involved with plot and thats story not narrative from my point of view because while narrative is usually encountered on the inside of story the two modes do not require each other and each one can appear pretty much alone there are stories without narratives in every newspaper in the country a hurricane swung inland and hit the the coast of florida once there was a peaceful town called tallahassee and now its in ruins you lay out the before and after with all the demographic and sociological detail you like and youve got a story without a narrative and there are narratives without stories plays like endgame or waiting for godot or in a more extreme case the wraparound paintings of rothkos houston chapel where the viewer can only struggle to see the paintings on the walls in front of him and try to relate them to the difficultly seen images of the paintings in back of him that he's desperately trying to hold stable in his mind while all of the paintings are subjected to changes in color and figuration by minute variations in the natural lighting every time a cloud passes overhead or to changes in the viewer who would like to believe that hes not changing in spite of the near inevitability of changes in his perceptual state and mood occasioned by the duration of \ndifficult viewing this is what ricoeur saw as the center of narrative the human mind confronting what he called the aporias the blind alleys of time but why do we want to represent it why does anybody represent to himself or herself the struggle for and against transformation and the answer may lie somewhere close to the anxiety produced by the paradox that however much we are tempted by transformation the beggar would always like to become a king but this change courts the danger that the beggar could be lost in the transformation and merely inherit the kings troubles without any memory of the satisfaction of the obliterated beggars desire or maybe it lies closer to the terror of absolute erosion that can be forecast by even the most minute changes in our lives so its the loss of experience that we're struggling against and the loss of the self in the increasing unintelligibility of our lives that is produced by time and today i was walking in the mall and we went to a bookstore and i bought a book that i was attracted to only by the title although its a beautiful book by a very good russian poet named osip mandelstam its a book called the noise of time and the name resonated for me in a way that went beyond mandelstams lovely essay of that name on the lost petersburg of his childhood and got me started thinking about all these things there was something in that name the noise of time that fascinated me in a way i didnt think it was possible for mandelstam to mean though what he meant by it wasnt entirely clear even to clarence brown the excellent translator of the book or rather brown sensed what it meant but wasnt quite sure of the best way to translate it and in the introduction he gives an elaborate description of the reason for his choice of the noise of time from a great variety of alternatives the name mandelstam had given the essay in russian was shum vremeni the second part is easy it means \"of time\" the question is what exactly shum means if you look in a russian dictionary it can mean the rustle of leaves the roar of the sea the pounding of the surf the buzzing in your ears the clamor of a crowd the drumming of rain the racket of traffic or more neutrally the sound or noise of any of these bundles of continuous repetitive percussive and abrasive events the translator cites all of these and adds one more an astonishing translation provided by vladimir nabokov in his weird version of pushkins eugene onegin nabokov was a formidably educated if eccentric linguist with a poets superb knowledge of russian and the translation he offers for shum is \"hubbub\" in what must be one of funniest lines ever to show up in a poem in english \"morns pleasant hubbub has awoken\" only a comic genius like nabokov could have produced a line like this where \"awoken\" is just about as funny as \"hubbub\" which he comments upon in a lengthy deadpan note that provides not only an extensive consideration of the onomatopoetic career of shum in all of its morphological forms but also an almost equally wonderful line of pushkins containing the word shum which he renders as \"morns frisky hubbub has resounded\" and \"frisky\" is almost as good but \"resounded\" cant compete with \"awoken\" yet in spite of all these wonderful suggestions i think i can understand why clarence brown chose to go with \"the noise of time\" clarence brown translated this work in 1963 or -64 just about the time that works like claude shannons book on communication theory became part of general culture this book and many works like it extended the meaning of \"noise\" to entropy the growing disorder that affects all ordered systems over time the frictional forces that reduce all directed energies to forms of disorder sooner or later as we go from more orderly universes to more disorderly universes given enough time working in the 60s brown must have sensed this though he may not even have been aware of it when he made mandelstam the gift of this brilliant new meaning of the word \"noise\" a meaning that mandelstam benefited from but couldnt possibly have known or intended when he wrote the noise of time in 1928 just ten years before he died in one of stalins prisons time does strange things to you its a bit like the ocean mostly it takes things away but it also casts things up on the beach new things or old ones from different places now looking very different every bit of disorder contributes to the formation of a new order usually worse but sometimes better you lose a lot and you may win a few maybe in the end you lose it all but meanwhile some disorder may be good for you even if you dont know it i was sitting in oklahoma city in a diner having lunch with leo steinberg and we were eating potato skins with two different kinds of gravy because oklahoma citys cuisine is distinguished by thirty kinds of gravy and very little else we had just given talks at the oklahoma city museum of art a pretty little beaux arts building complete with porte cochere which is perched perilously over an oil well that the trustees periodically threaten \nto open up whenever theres a shortfall in their operating funds or a sharp rise in oil prices now leo is not only the most elegant art historian i know but he is also distinguished in his profession by having the most extraordinary admiration for artists maybe even an exaggerated admiration for them and since he had just given a talk about picasso an artist upon whose genius he had reflected brilliantly for a very long time our conversation over potato skins swung around to a more general discussion of the mysterious sources of artistic genius which isnt a subject upon which i ordinarily have much of an opinion but in the course of the conversation leo quoted a line of shakespeares that he regarded as a distinctive mark of his poetic genius and it was certainly a remarkable line and its distinctive in many ways i think its from measure for measure and it goes \"his head sat so tickle on his shoulders that a milkmaid might sigh it off an she had been in love\" and its a pretty sardonic comic line coming as it does at a dark moment when the hero is in real danger of losing his life but what got leo was the word tickle \"tickle tickle nobody but a great poet could have written that\" up to then we were in agreement about it being a remarkable line but at the word tickle we parted company i agreed it was a pretty startling word and it stops you for a moment when you read the line and shakespeare was a brilliant poet but he was also a workmanlike if equally terrific playwright and it didnt seem to me too likely he would expend his energy on inventing an entirely new usage for a single word that could easily be misheard in a line of a quickly written play somehow it didnt seem too likely and somehow i felt that if he was a genius that wasnt the way his genius worked so i said \"come on leo i dont really know but i bet there were dozens of elizabethan uses of the word tickle that simply meant unstable or precarious thatve just disappeared or maybe its a misprint for fickle or maybe its a cognate with fickle but maybe its not maybe its just a normal word used in the ordinary way you would refer to a ticklish situation without suggesting the feeling of being rubbed lightly under the arms but we didnt agree because for leo i think a great artist is like an isolated mountain peak dominating the surrounding plain and for me a good artist has got to be very ordinary and a great artist is just more ordinary than everybody else so we left it at that but when i went back home i looked at the big oxford english dictionary and sure enough i found a late fifteenth century text that described rocks that stood so tickle in a stream they rendered passage perilous because you could fall and break your neck and i was about to write this to leo when i thought no i dont want to write this to leo why should i do that the noise of time had drowned out all the other ordinary uses of tickle and left shakespeares line alone a brilliant stone thrown up on the beach why should i take this gift away so you dont know what time will do it can stick a feather in your cap or take it away the feather may be blown out of the tail of a pheasant caught in a whirlwind and land on your hat but you never know whats going to happen still we struggle with time we try to come to terms with its transformations that undermine our understanding of our being because time is at war with being all the time and thinking of the separations of things the separations of things effected by time i think of the way generations are separated by time like my son who elly and i are very close to he grew up as an art kid the kind of kid who was at home with all kinds of art because he grew up with it he's four years old and we're driving along the freeway and he's getting bored because we're talking to each other not to him and he's sitting in the back seat suddenly he lets out a scream \"look i'm chris burden\" and dives head first into the front seat between us so i guess we brought him up the right way and he was not much older than that when we were once again driving along the freeway through a beautiful natural landscape and he spots a billboard with a wonderful mountain landscape in it and he says \"look theres a landscape in a landscape\" so we had an art kid when he was four years old but now he's thirty and he's running a think tank that advises people with lots of money at stake on whether the lira or the deutschmark or the kroner will rise or fall and he makes these predictions on the basis of the political expertise he's been acquiring since he was a kid since the days when he used to hang out at the university library and study all the newspapers and elly and i had to bring him back the local papers from wherever we went to do readings or performances and he makes these predictions \nfrom a certain sense of distance because although he's predicting these outcomes for people who are profoundly interested in money and passionately committed to profit he has relatively little interest in profit and somewhat like an artist he's mainly interested in the game so theres a separation of a sort but a connection across it and we come together in certain interests we share though in different ways across a space that we understand and it remains a space though we can look across it and one of the spaces we shared and looked across almost but not quite together was the greater space separating him from his grandfather ellys stepfather was a man of the nineteenth century at least he was born in the nineteenth century a hungarian poet and painter named peter moor whose real hungarian name was barna joszef whod taken the romantic name moor after shakespeares moor of venice and my sons name is blaise cendrars after the romantic name taken by a young swiss boy on his way to becoming a great french poet so they had something in common across a gap of about 70 years and peter and blaise spent a lot of time together blaise used to visit him regularly and play tennis with him and its not easy to play tennis with an eighty-eight year old guy who has elegant strokes but moves somewhat slowly around the court it takes more effort than playing a thirty year old because when your eighty-eight year old partner hits a deft forehand into your backhand corner you have to take it on the run and return it with only moderate power to a point no more than one running step away from him so that he can make a stylish return to keep the rally going for a sixteen year old blaise was very good at this and at refraining from hitting a full power serve and he was also good at receiving lectures between games on how to improve his backhand or forehand in the manner of borotra or lacoste or henri cochet or other great stars of the distant past it was a little exasperating but blaise was good at it because peter was very charming and could explain to him why kurt vonnegut was too smart to be a truly great writer or tell him stories about growing up in a small town in hungary before the first world war about being on his schools gymnastics team and about the little white peaches of kechkemet that were sweeter than any he'd ever eaten for the rest of his life or about pre-war budapest and the swimming pool of the hotel gellert with its artificial waves and the famous candy shop with the most voluptuous chocolates in all of europe but then he might also talk to him about the excellences of the poetry of ady or of hofmansthal or goethes faust and this was probably a little less interesting for blaise who is a talented writer but has no patience for nineteenth century poetry but between peter and blaise there was a real intimacy across the space of 7000 miles and 70 years of experience that separated 1914 budapest from 1980s california an intimacy that may have been as deep as the gap was wide blaise was sixteen and just awakening into his sexuality and peter at eighty-eight could look back from a waning physical being on a long history of romantic attachments whose image burnt so much more brightly now in the light of memory and unsatisfied desire now that the last and longest of these attachments to eleanors mother a beautiful woman even in her seventies had disappeared with her descent into the abyss of alzheimers and one thing they probably shared was a sense of sexual loneliness i dont really know what they talked about in all the time they spent together but peter was the first person except perhaps for blaises closest friend brett to learn of his first real girl friend so i'm sure that peter remembering the temptations and fears of his own distant adolescence must have offered blaise a mix of chivalric encouragement and cautionary tales from the experiences of his fin de siecle youth in one of the great capitals of the hapsburg empire which is what he must have meant when he said that he'd given blaise some \"very good advises\" and whatever blaise made of these \"advises\" he must have sensed through the intense nostalgia of these schnitzlerian reminiscences the intensity of peters loneliness and sexual longing an eighty-eight year old hungarian poet and painter who had outlived his contemporaries now living in california surrounded by people who couldnt speak his native language whose beautiful and accomplished paintings could find no appreciative audience because their time had passed without making him sufficiently famous to preserve them a place in the history of either hungarian or american art whose poems could really be understood by no one he knew and blaise was the only one to whom peter could comfortably confide in however masked a form the desperation of his sexual desire and all blaise could do was listen but peters birthday was coming up and blaise wanted to get him a present he knew that fairly soon he would be going away to college and he wouldnt be able to see peter quite as often and wanted to get him something very special he talked this over with his friend brett and at length they came to a decision the two sixteen year olds decided to find him a hooker now i only heard of this many years later \nfrom someone who wasnt there either but as i understand it this is what happened they took bretts parents great red cherokee and cruised slowly through san diegos gaslight district looking for a hooker their plan was to find a girl in miniskirt and boots and too much makeup and arrange for her to encounter peter probably in the supermarket where she would pretend that she'd heard he was a great artist and convince him that she desperately wanted to see his paintings and then he would take her up to his apartment to look at the paintings and she would seduce him this was the great plan and they would pay her pretty well theyd pooled all their money and they had something like a hundred and fifty dollars that theyd saved up they had it all worked out and the only thing they needed to do was find the hooker so they got into the red cherokee and drove downtown to the gaslight district where they spotted a woman in a miniskirt and boots they double parked and blaise ran out to talk to her look he said weve got a job for you and she looked doubtful its an eighty-eight year old gentleman thats cool she said theyre gentle he's a painter blaise said its ok she said i'm hip this was 1984 and she spoke in the language of the sixties blaise went on youve got to meet him by accident and pretend you know about him and you want to look at his paintings i dont know she said i dont know about that brett came out of the car to help you dont have to say a lot he said he'll tell you all about them and he'll probably recite some poetry to you in german blaise added or hungarian in german?",0.6172890067100525],["sorabji.com

Traditional Family Not Worth Mentioning Words Defective Genes The Master Race His Blind Date when his brother's girlfriend asks him to be the blind date for a pretty German girl visiting her aunt in Antwerp the words he hears are pretty and girl - at age twenty his thoughts of girls and how to meet them consume many of his waking hours only later after he has accepted this blind date his first does the girl's nationality cause him alarm anxiety intrudes into his eager expectations grows stronger as the afternoon comes to a close by early evening he is almost ready to call it off -- all afternoon he has remembered what his father has written into the family's Bible -- in memory of my dear father killed by the Germans in memory of my dear mother killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Elijahu his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Tsilia her husband and three children killed by the Germans in memory of my brother Chaim his wife and two children killed by the Germans in memory of my sister Hannah and her husband killed by the Germans in memory of my cousins aunts and uncles killed by the Germans his mother's family had suffered a similar fate the only survivor of the nearly hundred relatives was his father's youngest sister her husband and two sons who had survived by hiding in a cramped place too low to stand upright liberated by the Russians so weak and stooped none of them could stand up straight memories he hadn't thought about for years flood him - his father's escape to Paris in 1942 his own dread at age four he would never see his father again his flight with his mother older sister and brother to Paris to join their father their night journey from Paris to Lyon their stay at a house filled with refugees waiting for visas and opportunities to escape to safety all of them sleeping on the floor little food available his parents short tempered with him his brother and sister fear permeating the air around them how could he forget the night when boots were heard on the stairs loud voices yelled in German open up hurry over and over his father had had the presence of mind to turn off the light had put his finger to his mouth they had all cowered on the floor hardly daring to breathe terrified at having their door kicked in and being discovered by the Germans he remembers the cries of their neighbors outside on the stairs he remembers the wailing of people being dragged out of their rooms he remembers hearing the sound of people being kicked and slapped until finally an eerie silence entered - miracle of miracles the Germans had not kicked in their door after a few more hours of cowering on the floor in the ominous silence his father opened the door and they slipped from the house the only ones not caught by the Nazis that night they walked for the rest of the night his father hoisting him onto his shoulders when his little legs gave out then commanded him to walk again when his father was too exhausted to carry him until they arrived at the border of Switzerland the next day hungry thirsty exhausted terrified but safety was not yet assured -- rumors had spread that the Swiss sent many Jewish refugees back they were lucky families with children under six years old were allowed in his parents were sent to an internment camp each child given to a foster family separated from his parents his six year old brother and his beloved ten year old sister he was terrified of his foster mother stern Fr&auml;ulein Hausman who didn't understand the anxiety of this little boy who wet his bed and wouldn't stop crying Fr&auml;ulein Hausman beat him with a stick his skinny arms and hands black and blue \nuntil his parents were allowed to visit their son after a few months shocked to see his bruises and were able to remove him to an orphanage the end of the war and their return to Antwerp brought more pain - his parents' discovery of the murder of almost all of their relatives and many of their former neighbors and friends their gentile neighbors calling them dirty Jews why did you come back his father's struggle to make a living as a diamond cleaver in the postwar chaos who needed diamonds when people needed food and housing he remembers his father's all-consuming sadness which never left him until he died he remembers his mother's preoccupation of seeing WWIII behind the slightest political instability and their despair when many of the remaining Jews of Antwerp left for Israel or Canada his only surviving aunt uncle their two sons departing for Toronto at the outbreak of the Korean war firmly convinced war and the extermination of Jews were welded together he remembers the adults talking among themselves about the murders of their relatives their horrifying flights always barely a hair's breadth ahead of death he feels guilty for having looked forward to seeing this girl a German how can he when his parents life was shattered beyond repair by them but then a thought occurs to him - he will meet this German girl and he will ask her how all this could have happened and what her parents and relatives knew and did when he meets the German girl she is not at all what he had expected a well scrubbed Aryan with blond braids and an upturned nose this German girl looks quite beautiful to him her long dark hair swept to one side of her face enticingly made up her slender body dressed in a narrow pale yellow dress a black stole wrapped around her shoulders she walks gracefully on high heels seems sophisticated and worldly greets him with an open smile ready to enjoy the evening and she reminds him of French girls in her cosmopolitan elegance and is startled when he realizes she actually looks Jewish with her dark looks and distinct nose the minute they sit together in a nightclub in Brussels he feels comfortable with this girl she is cheerful talks easily is well-read has soft movements is all woman he is taken by her strong feminine presence intrigued by her intellectual mind and the ease of her dancing all evening he struggles with the questions he has stored in his mind but doesn't want to destroy this enchanting evening he waits and waits for just the right moment they talk dance some more exchange stories talk about books and their favorite city Paris and finally late into the evening during a slow blues melody dancing cheek to cheek he asks her what do you think of Auschwitz she flippantly answers that she isn't a history buff and doesn't care about Napoleon and his battles taken aback he realizes she doesn't know about Auschwitz and has misunderstood it for Austerlitz back at their table he tells her about Hitler the Nazis gas chambers and six million of his people killed there is no more dancing cheek to cheek that night instead they talk till day break he watches her confusion anger rage shame and finds himself falling in love with this beautiful girl who listens in anguish they exchange addresses and write long letters to each other during the next year he sends her books by Sartre Camus Simone de Beauvoir they discuss existentialism pacifism a united Europe a world without war but neither have the language to write about their anguish - his daily life with a father consumed by grief silent except for his prayers unable to relate to his children and she doesn't tell him of her horror of having grown up among murderers Menu of Poems A Traditional Family theirs was a traditional family they lived in a tenement in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties - father worked long hours as a watchmaker in mid-town Manhattan took a bagged lunch so as to save money only took off work on the high holy days and for two weeks in summer mother stayed home took care of the three children born one each year starting two years after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau and the reunion with her fianc&eacute; who had hid in a makeshift bunker built in a ditch with another escapee where they carefully rationed their last loaf of bread to a thin slice per day and finally crawled out of their hiding place in desperation and near death not caring anymore whether they would be killed by the Nazis only to find out that the war had been over for almost two weeks she cooked traditional Hungarian meals for her family carefully stored any leftovers knitted sweaters with lovely patterns for her children sewed their clothes kept them all squeaky clean lit the Shabbes candles on Friday night and thought it was a miracle that they had been able to get a visa for America and were able to raise their family away from the horrors they had gone through in Europe their education had been cut short by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis in Hungary and a year in Auschwitz three years in DP camps in Germany after liberation followed by four years in Sweden the first country to take them in offered them a home with a new language to learn and then their immigration to America after they had been located by a second cousin of her murdered mother who had been gassed on the first day of their arrival in Auschwitz the second cousin sponsored them yet the struggles with this new beginning with yet another language to learn made them socialize mostly with other holocaust survivors from Hungary they led a \nmodest life with few luxuries because they were saving every penny they could for the down payment of a little house in a less crowded section of Brooklyn but once a year the father rented a little cottage in the woods - he wanted his children to know about nature and sunsets and running around without any restrictions for weeks their mother prepared for this holiday - carefully packed dry goods so that they wouldn't have to spend too much money and on the eve of their departure their father instructed them all about the careful plan of their departure - most of their luggage and dry goods had been carried over to a friends' house in another neighborhood over several days in small amounts and at two in the morning mother set out for a meeting place a new one each year followed by a child every forty-five minutes firmly instructed to close the door quietly to walk down the stairs silently and to report whether anybody saw her until they were all together picked up their luggage at the friends' house and finally still dark outside took the train to the country for years the children thought that this was the usual ritual of leaving on summer vacations - until their father explained to them as they got older that he didn't want to give any Nazis living in their neighborhood in Brooklyn the opportunity to follow them to their summer cottage in the woods and murder them without witnesses around Menu of Poems Not Worth Mentioning sometimes he doesn't feel quite whole feels he disconnects feels he distances himself and doesn't feel the overwhelming sadness he thinks he ought to feel he constantly reads about the Holocaust studies it saves every newspaper article related to it participates in discussions and considers the Holocaust museum in Washington DC the photo album he doesn't have and the family story he only knows in fragments all his life the Holocaust was and is to this day part of most conversations with his parents sentences still frequently start with when I was in camp when I was home (meaning Poland) before the war but there is never a chronological story neatly organized into a series of events that could give him a full picture everything is told in snatches a piece here a piece there but nothing adds up to a whole story his parents insist they told him everything tell him there is nothing to explain to him yet he was stunned at the stories they told the Spielberg people and found himself saying out loud to the TV while watching the video you never told me that he has watched his parents video but ten months later he reports his parents stories have become blurred they simply refuse to be remembered cohesively instead reassert themselves as the familiar childhood fragments when he was a child war meant being cooped up in the ghetto or in a camp he clearly knew that something unimaginably awful had happened to his parents but couldn't figure out what his American born friends' fathers had all served in the army and he thought that people either went to the army or to a concentration camp during a war he had no idea what had happened in those camps and didn't understand sentences like because this happened our families were killed and you have no relatives he imagined camp was somewhat like a prison except he couldn't imagine his parents having committed any crimes - the mere idea of them breaking a law was beyond his imagination his mother used to complain that aunt Gella never once asked what happened and what was it like she was angry that nobody over here was interested in knowing what happened over there as a result most of his parents friends have always been survivors - like them all of them understood the same coded language but nobody considered the need to decipher the code for the children he felt guilty asking for anything other kids had -- asking for a toy no matter how inexpensive invariably led to sentences like in camp we did without in camp we didn't have he still hears it as an adult it's always hovering in the background he knows knows in a deep and horrible sense his parents went through the most unimaginable experience and survived the spoken and unspoken mantra always has been and still is more than fifty years later we know what hell is like how dare you compare your troubles to our tragedy as a little boy there was nothing he could say to counter his parents arguments when asking for a toy and as an adult he knows no heartache no professional upsets not even the recent death of his close friend nothing in his life absolutely nothing will ever compare to his parents' suffering and is therefore not worth mentioning Menu of Poems Words bold letters on top of the page declare this newsletter is dedicated to all those who perished in the Holocaust the German gentile now living in the U.S. is proud of his efforts to pay homage to the victims of the Shoah on the anniversary of Kristallnacht but I am disturbed by the word perish in this dedication -- it conjures up images of people dying in earth quakes in a storm out on the open sea in a hurricane or a tornado the word perish does not tell me about open ditches rapidly filling up with the corpses of innocent men women and children shot by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht it doesn't show me piles of emaciated bodies deliberately starved to death it doesn't show me SS guards using victims for target practice nor does it display the twisted bodies of people who died at the hands of doctors who performed cruel experiments in the \nname of science there are no gas chambers crematoria or perpetrators weren't Jews, Gypsies and non-Aryans murdered I ask the German man yes of course the victims of the Holocaust were murdered he answers taken aback by my question but this word sounds so aggressive he adds with dismay after several days of back and forth the German man decides to delete the entire sentence on top of the newsletter rather than using the word murdered in his dedication to the victims of the Shoah while discussing this with several friends we take note that a lengthy article in a leading magazine had recently informed us that most of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda had been hacked to death by their Hutu neighbors - no euphemisms here as to how these victims died and on discussing the three million Cambodians who died in the Killing Fields the language is quite clear - they were starved to death or were brutally murdered by the Kmer Rouge On further probing no one suggests that John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King perished - both were assassinated a few weeks later I ask a Holocaust survivor what words would properly describe the actions by which six million died they were exterminated he says without hesitation this word immediately reminds me of my first months in the United States in an apartment in Brooklyn and the discovery of cockroaches in my kitchen cupboards honey my next door neighbor had told me then look in the yellow pages under exterminator recently I heard Mike Wallace of 60 minutes refer to all those who were lost in Auschwitz the word lost makes me think of my fear of getting lost in foreign cities on my travels abroad when even maps are of limited value in those countries which use different alphabets the word also calls up images of thick forests where hapless travelers get lost and I am reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel which used to make me appreciate the safety of our crammed house when I was a child what with the twice a day roll calls and the meticulous record keeping by German and Austrian concentration camp commanders the chances of being lost in Auschwitz or any other concentration camp were very slim my friend Dalia explains to me whose mother was gassed on the first day of their arrival in Birkenau Menu of Poems Defective Genes over a bowl of clam chowder in an old New England fishing town she tells me that her earliest memories are of defeat bomb craters ruins rubble long bread lines men with missing limbs bitterness still the only sorrow her father ever expressed amidst the despair of the postwar years was for the fourteen year old boys he saw dying in the trenches crying out for their mothers he expressed no anger at the men who drafted fourteen year old boys and made them cannon fodder at the Eastern Front Hitler was a good man he continued to say even after barely escaping his and his family's death during the three years of bombing in Bremen and the collapse of the Thousand Year Reich brought on by the invasions of dozens of countries and the killing of tens of millions of people whose countries they had invaded without any provocation because they believed themselves to be the master race and had felt entitled to plunder oppress exploit rape kill when he talked about Hitler the good man her father didn't mention the one night in which seventy thousand civilians were incinerated in Stalingrad through fire bombing by the Luftwaffe Hitler just went a little too far her father would add as an afterthought her mother the block warden had even greeted family members with an enthusiastic Heil Hitler and had made sure nothing unfavorable was ever mentioned against her beloved F&uuml;hrer - those who doubted the final victory or expressed disapproval of the Nazi regime were promptly reported by her to the Gestapo her maternal grandfather had been an ardent officer of the SS and enjoyed scaring his grandchildren with a nasty temper and vicious threats and her grandmother the SS officer's wife told her daughter that the best way to control her children was by the divide and conquer method - have them at each other's throat and snitch on each other she advised her even after Hitler's suicide and the discovery of the gas chambers and crematoria in concentration camps the SS officer's daughter and the former German soldier taught their children they were superior to all other people and should despise Gypsies Jews and anyone different in fourth grade she made two little refugee girls who had dark hair and olive complexion her personal slaves - they had to carry her school books call her princess and beg for mercy when they broke any of the many rules she imposed on them mercy was not always granted despite their tearful pleading and hitting them made her feel good after the frequent beatings she received at home at age twelve she and her family emigrated to California with their three children and in their new country greeted by a perennially blue sky warmed by sunshine surrounded by abundance their mouths watering at the mountains of exotic fruit plenty of bread meat chicken eggs and candy she was teased by the other children for being German and was called a Nazi this was her first hint that Germans had not been victims but had done something bad during WWII a few years later she learned what her people had done when they studied the Holocaust in school and she learned about atrocities committed by her people during the Eichmann trial shortly thereafter the full extent of her people's abominations was described in the newspapers week after week she was numb with shock read about the Third Reich as much as she could find \neventually dared to make friends with people of different skin color and discovered they were not much different from her she volunteered in a soup kitchen taught homeless people reading and writing tried to be good tried to cleanse herself tried to be part of normal people's lives but when she married and her husband wanted children she was afraid to tell him that she couldn't have children - her genes carried the blueprint to degrade children to hit them to look at them with loathing and to be compelled to be a mean mother she was afraid that even if she overcame her defective genes with hard work and became a normal mother who would be able to love her children there was the distinct possibility that she would give birth to monsters who would walk around in black boots and uniforms who would think of sadistic ways of killing their neighbors' cats and dogs torture birds carry out sinister plots against children who were not blond and blue-eyed and would grow up into murderers by the time she knew in her mind and her heart that she was not genetically defective and not programmed to be a cruel mother and that her genes did not carry a blueprint for monsters and had in fact remade herself into a caring and splendid human being with the help of therapy and loving friends her marriage was over and the clock had run out for having children at fifty-five her heart aches for the children she has denied herself Menu of Poems The Master Race during a brisk walk along the shoreline Werner tells me how devastated he was when classmates called him a Nazi during the Eichmann trial in their new home in Chicago to which they had emigrated in the early fifties from their home town in north Germany he was sixteen at the time of that trial had learned English well since his arrival in 1951 and had been raised with pride in his heritage by his Nazi parents even though their house had turned into rubble during WWII -- two uncles had died at the Eastern front and one in captivity in Russia after the war and there was nothing left of the family business which had supplied blankets to the war effort his father and mother looked with pride on their two sons and two daughters all of them tall blond blue-eyed and athletic his father hardened himself with cold showers in the morning endurance was emphasized and crying not tolerated all of them were spurred on to participate in vigorous and competitive sports - let's show those soft Americans what we Germans can do was their father's continuous battle cry even though his father's pipe dream of becoming rich in America and showing off to his impoverished family back in Germany was not materializing - one scheme after another had gone bust and Werner was ashamed of their shabby apartment and the hand-me-down clothes he had to wear his parents had no friends and he and his siblings were discouraged to bring classmates back home because his father was suspicious of all Americans even the blond and blue-eyed ones after all Americans believed in the melting pot he told them you could never know what inferior genes were lurking in their bodies an insult to humanity he used to call this mixing of people from different countries and nothing good would come out of it he declared frequently don't forget he used to lecture his children we are the master race and far superior to anybody else he blamed Hitler's defeat on the Conspiracy of World Jewry and on all those Germans who had not sufficiently supported Hitler and The Thousand Year Reich when he came home from his menial job after washing down his schnapps with several beers he insisted they listen to him when he told them about the ancient Nordic gods who hadn't believed in weakness and mercy he instructed them that only the master race was entitled to rule the world and that all others were destined to do their bidding and to obey them during the Eichmann trial discussed at great length on television in the newspapers and at school Werner was horrified to learn about the atrocities committed by his people he joined a peace group in college broke with his father became a teacher and devoted himself to many worthy causes during the next thirty years eventually Werner participated in a training program to teach hard core criminals conflict resolution and now spends most of his free time in a maximum security prison I see his eyes light up when he talks about the bonds he has formed with those inmates and hear his pride in having been able to help the prisoners learn reading and writing besides conflict resolution I am touched by Werner's compassion and caring for those prison inmates but miss the mentioning of the victims of those former perpetrators who raped assaulted committed robberies and murders and what do the inmates think of your work I ask Werner the tall blond blue-eyed athletic man stops his brisk walk for a moment and tells me looking at me with pride and joy they treat us like gods Excerpts From Manuscript Top Of Page Designed by SqygeyNork

now caution my freind dont step in the water 'til you know you can swim Freeze Up empty factories to the east and all our waste the shape of things that came shows on the broken workers face to the west you'll find our silicon promised lands where machines replace our minds for systematic profit plans the course of human progress staggers like a drunk its steps are quick and heavy and its mind is slow and blunt I look for optimism but I just dont know its seeds are planted in a poison place where nothing grows its 1989 stand up and take a look around weathers bitter tension it seems is sinking down drunk with power and fighting one another every hour shows the winter getting harder theres a freezeup coming one nation stands the tallest radiating blinding light plastic and fluorescent energy robbing us of sight set in our way content with our decay we wave the flag of freedom as we conquer and invade ever ask yrself wheres my place in this hell but no ones there to tell you cuz they dont know that themselves the well rehearsed lines from our elated politicians no longer offer solace we can see the self destruction just one political song to drop into the list that is years and years long Artificial Life hes got a song about a love thats gone away sometimes his eyes shed tiny teardrops when he plays his touching ballads are just there sitting to buy they call it music but it seems more like a lie artificial life in the marketplace epic ballads by the musical whores life is so boring project theirs onto yours hear the anthems of the pepsi generation see the martyrs of our spiritual degradation artificial life in the marketplace american culture disneyland freak show screen in your living room a window for your tomb if you cant compare to the world sitting there repress your insecurities watch and escape give me artificial give me superficial give me a commercial life that can't be bought this I say to you what I say is true emotions aren't a

walls made of opinions thru which we speak and never listen ceiling made of pride vicious and self satisfied door thats made of rage hard and slowly aged always closing tighter with every war that's waged room without a window cant see out... floor is made of lives wed gladly end to stay inside corners made of borders, borders made of law and order painted with the words of politicians and religion plastered with the wreckage of our cultural division room without a window cant see out...

Junkies Running Dry I always looked up on the ones who walked away choosing themselves over preset ways of looking at a future that had no room for the questions they lived for always knew i never could have walked away myself my self worth was beyond any help and i didnt care to test it against the rejection i had seen before but those i loved so much they underwent a change they're working fourty hours they got caught in the game like junkies running dry, the vulnerability they're always there on time we're never satisfied like junkies running dry this wonderful generosity a third of our lives to do what we please doesn't look that great to me in fact it doesnt even look fair they call it youthful idealism and even I would have to agree with them except some of us grow up and its still there I grow up too slow I don't wanna go but now i'm working just like everyone else but ill get out of here Here We Go Again *it's not the ending its the beginning the ground is moist and it rained last night smells like smoke and it smells so clean the sun is shining down like a freindly white light here we go again analyzed the world I was born into but I could never understand knew I never wanted to grow up if that meant being a &quot;man&quot; dominating strict competition is the meaning of our lives stomping on the weak keeps us the winner of the battle in our minds tensions in our lives that are attacking our minds unite themselves together to make our conciousness blind conditioned to self-interest with emotions locked away if that's what they call normal i'd rather be insane relax yourself from giving what you want to do with your life ease up from giving up things like control of yr own mind if you never ask any question then you're never gonna get no answer always be wondering what do you want while you keep getting older faster here we go again another test of manhood just when you thought youd won the more we keep competing the more the battle has just
