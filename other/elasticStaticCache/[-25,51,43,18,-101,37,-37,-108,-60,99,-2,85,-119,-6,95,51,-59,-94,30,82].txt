Explain the global impacts of human changes in the physical environment, as exemplified by being able to Describe the spatial consequences, deliberate and inadvertent, of human activities that have global implications (e.g., the dispersal of animal and plant species worldwide increases in runoff and sediment, tropical soil degradation, habitat destruction, air pollution, alterations in the hydrologic cycle) Identify and debate the positive and negative aspects of landscape changes in the students local community and region that relate to peoples changing attitudes toward the environment (e.g., pressure to replace farmlands with wetlands in floodplain areas, interest in preserving wilderness areas, support of the concept of historic preservation) Examine the characteristics of major global environmental changes and assess whether the changes are a result of human action, natural causes, or a conmbination of both factors (e.g., increases in world temperatures attributable to major global action, the link between changes in solar emissions and amounts of volcanic dust in the atmosphere attributable to natural causes) C.

When we speak of theenvironment, we refer to the living as well as the non-living world around us, including trees,air, soil, water, plants, animals, rivers, oceans, fish, and insects. The environment also includeshuman beings and the creations of human beings – cities, farms, homes, and temples. Ashuman beings, we are inseparable from our environment and cannot exist without the naturalenvironment.Because humans are part of the environment, our activities can greatly change the naturalworld. Usually our activities affect the environment in three ways. First, we take resourcesfrom the natural environment, such as fish, minerals, wood, clean water, and gems. Second,we add things to the environment, such as smoke from fires, plastic bottles, aluminum cans andplastic bags. Third, we replace the natural environment with something else. An example of this is the clearing of a forest and replacing it with a road or houses or factories.When billions of human beings all over the world take things from the environment, add thingsto the environment and replace the natural environment with other things, the natural worldcan be greatly changed. Most natural resources are limited, so taking too much from theenvironment can use up these resources. For example, if we take too many fish from theTonle Sap, there will be fewer fish to breed and fewer fish in the lake in the future. Also,adding too much waste to the environment can have negative effects. In small amounts,waste is not a serious problem because the natural environment can absorb some waste. Butthere is a limit to the amount of waste that the natural environment can accept. If we add toomuch waste to the natural environment, the water, air and land become too dirty to use.Finally, replacing too much of a natural resource with something else can also have negativeeffects. The amount of land available to convert to human use is limited. For example, if aforest is destroyed to create farmland, it can take hundreds of years to regenerate a similarforest.Human activities have always changed the environment. In the past, the effects of theseactions were localized – people’s actions would change a small plot of land or a short length of a stream. Today, however, modern technology makes it possible for people to damage acountry or the entire world very quickly. For example, with modern technology, large forestscan be cleared so rapidly that the weather of the entire planet is changed, resulting in rainfallchanges even in regions that are far from the forest.Because of our capacity to change the natural environment rapidly and on a large scale, it isimportant for us to understand environmental issues and to manage these issues appropriately.This is a challenge because little is known about all effects of human activities and modern",0.8314006328582764],["214 Principles of Environmental Biology (2nd sem) Examines the nature of the relationships of plants, animals, and humans to their environment and how these may change when pollutants are introduced.",0.8244166970252991],["214 Principles of Environmental Biology (2nd sem) Examines the nature of the relationships of plants, animals, and humans to their environment and how these may change when pollutants are introduced.",0.8244166970252991],["NRMO wanted to identify trends, patterns, and changes in plant population caused by natural occurrences (such as winter rains washing seeds to unsuitable sites) and human activities (for example, duck hunting).",0.8232253789901733],["Specific plants have been studied in the laboratory (for example, potatoes and wheat) for applicability to the CELSS environment.",0.8173785209655762],["But many inscriptions have been worn away by wind, rust and rain, which has destroyed decorative ironwork.",0.8109682202339172],["Wind, rain, and human use have helped distribute the tailings and heavy metals to the nearby communities and environment.",0.8100709915161133],["Wind, rain, and human use have helped distribute the tailings and heavy metals to the nearby communities and environment.",0.8100709915161133],["The populations of many native plants have been greatly reduced as a result of human encroachment which has destroyed many millions of acres of natural habitat.",0.8088364601135254],["The populations of many native plants have been greatly reduced as a result of human encroachment which has destroyed many millions of acres of natural habitat.",0.8088364601135254],["It is destroying itself as it destroys human society and destroys the natural environment.",0.8078359961509705],["The potential dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists.

You've seen plants that look lifeless--no leaves or new growth. Suddenly, after a rain, the plant is opening buds, sprouting leaves, and sending up new shoots. People who study biology, called biologists, use these characteristics to determine that something is alive: 1) Living things expend energy to maintain the internal conditions necessary for survival. 2) Living things grow, develop, and reproduce in a repeating cycle of change. 3) Living things respond to changes in the environment (respond to stimuli)in ways that increase their chances of surviving. 4) Living things are made of cells.",0.7947483658790588],["In addition to having the ability to adapt to their environments, living organisms have the ability to change their environments.
