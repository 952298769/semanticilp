Coral Reef Ecology describe three general types of coral reefs - fringing, atolls, and patch correctly identify and differentiate between hard and soft corals identify the dominant corals on Bermuda's reefs learn how the different growth forms of coral represent adaptations to environmental conditions recognise that coral growth provides the physical matrix within which all other reef species live understand the definition of symbiotic relationships, specifically between corals and zooxanthellae learn why corals must receive sunlight, and understand how zooxanthellae photosynthesize understand the interdependency of corals and the other reef organisms (fish, invertebrates, plankton, etc.) record the types and numbers of corals in three different sites (e.g. South Shore shoals, North Rock, Shelly Bay) illustrate a typical coral reef food chain identify the common sponges and their ecological significance in the coral reef ecosystem identify the main types of reef algae, and their ecological significance in the coral reef ecosystem B. Shallow Bay Communities describe the features of a shallow bay (sea grass bed) explain the importance of the community (stabilising marine sediments, providing habitats and breeding grounds and being both a primary producer and provider of food for many organisms) identify the three major species of sea grass - shoal grass, manatee grass and turtle grass investigate two shallow bay communities (e.g. Tobacco Bay, Whalebone Bay) C. Plankton recognize the differences between phytoplankton and zooplankton and their roles in the reef ecosystem understand the process of photosynthesis, and how phytoplankton photosynthesis effects the environment illustrate the food chain involving phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish take part in an open water and a sheltered water plankton tow conduct a laboratory analysis of plankton samples and make a record of the findings D. Reef Fish identify common reef fish: angel fish, butterfly fish, damselfish, and their most frequently seen species recognise common sharks identify fish which travel with sharks (pilotfish, sharksuckers, etc.) understand the important role of reef fish to the ecology of the reef E. Mangroves explain the importance of mangroves in stabilising the shore line and providing a breeding area understand that &quot;mangrove&quot; is a term applied to over 50 species of tree, not necessarily related, but all adapted to loose wet soil, a saline habitat and periodic tidal submergence identify the physical characteristics of red, black and white mangroves, and explain the differences between them describe the reason why Bermuda's mangroves have decreased, and the effect this has on the environment outline two types of strategies that the mangroves use for regulating the saline level within the plant F. Geology read or attend an introductory talk on the birth of Bermuda identify and compare the many easily observed strata of rock and learn to associate them with ancient geologic eras learn to recognise erosional features such as marine notches, potholes and sea-cut caves identify fossil features - &quot;Palmetto Stumps&quot; (fossil tree stumps appearing as round holes with a hard outer casing of calcium carbonate);",1.088050127029419],["Keep Grass Away Do not: water grass heavily near trees that normally grow on dry sites lime grass heavily near trees that grow best in acid soils wound trees with lawnmowers and other machines Heavy use of herbicides may harm trees.",1.0746729373931885],["Securing the airport, some commandos waded into high grass and palm trees and others crouched near the tarmac, guns at the ready, while the planes landed, swiftly unloaded, and took off for another sortie.",1.0733610391616821],["Securing the airport, some commandos waded into high grass and palm trees and others crouched near the tarmac, guns at the ready, while the planes landed, swiftly unloaded, and took off for another sortie.",1.0733610391616821],["Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren.",1.0695710182189941],["Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren.",1.0695710182189941],["Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren.",1.0695710182189941],["Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren.",1.0695710182189941],["Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren.",1.0695710182189941],["For example, according to modern botany: A palm tree has more in common with a blade of grass than with other trees.",1.0583515167236328],["Various other plants and trees that look like Earth's ferns, palm trees, mosses, grasses, bamboo, and succulents.",1.0583515167236328],["And Russians ... they now have citrus trees, olives, date palms and other ornamental palms on the Black sea coast and in some colder areas, thousands of hectares.",1.0524871349334717],["Some of the organisms in this area are abalone, sea anemones, brown seaweed, chitons, crabs, green algae, hydroids, isopods, limpets, mussels, nudibranchs, sculpin, sea cucumber, sea lettuce, sea palms, sea stars, sea urchins, shrimp, snails, sponges, surf grass, tube worms, and whelks.",1.0204222202301025],["the calcium of the reef provides the sand and sediment in which mangroves and sea grasses grow;",1.0166772603988647],["According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi in 1992, \"The village site is thickly covered with grass and other vegetation, including some eucalyptus and palm trees.",1.015782117843628],["On the 1200 hectares of sea shelter from the swell, one finds many flocks of birds, of which some are rare species, and flora not expected at this latitude: Mimosas, rhododendrons, camellias, fig trees, palms and other species more commonly seen on Mediterranean shores.",1.010908603668213],["Miami Herald &quot;...a 72-mile string of tranquil sandy beaches flanked by picturesque palms, punctuated with tall grasses, and subdivided by long piers where patient fisherpersons reel in baby sharks and a dozen other sea species.",1.0047107934951782]]
