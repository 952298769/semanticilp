[["Flurries usually produce little accumulation snow load the downward force on an object or structure caused by the weight of accumulated snow snow water equivalent the water content obtained from melting snowpack the total snow and ice on the ground, including both new snow and the previous snow and ice which has not melted snow squall a brief, but intense fall of snow that greatly reduces visibility and which is often accompanied by strong winds sublimation the process in which ice changes directly to water vapor without melting, but also in meteorology the opposite process in which water vapor is transformed to ice (also called deposition) supercooled the condition when a liquid remains in the liquid state even through its temperature is below its freezing point supersaturation the condition which occurs in the atmosphere when the relative humidity is greater than 100 percent surface hoar the deposition (sublimation) of ice crystals on a surface which occurs when the temperature of the surface is colder than the air above and colder than the frost point of that air vapor pressure the pressure exerted by water vapor molecules in a given volume of air",2.1368062496185303]]
