During the colder winter months in temperate regions there are too few insects to make hunting an energetically worthwhile activity. Thus, in order to circumnavigate this veritable famine, microbats hibernate to conserve energy. As I cover in more detail in the Questions and Answers section, hibernation is more than merely sleeping. In his book Bats, Phil Richardson notes that, during hibernation, a bat’s heartbeat can drop to about 20 beats per minute (bmp), taking about five breaths per minute. This is a significant decrease for a microbat, which may have heart rates as high as 900 to 1000 bpm during feeding. Such heartbeat rates are high for mammals; while typing this, my heart is beating about 70 times per minute and I’m taking some 20 breaths; my heart would give out long before it reached the beat frequency of a feeding microbat. The idea of all this is that by lowering their heart rate and metabolism (oxygen consumption can drop to one hundredth of waking rates) the bats burn fewer calories per unit time and can make any energy source -- be it a meal of insects or fat reserves -- last longer. In a 2003 paper for the journal Doklady Biological Sciences, a group of Russian scientists report on the hibernation of two species of Vesper (so-called ‘evening’) bats in central and southern Yakutia (a territory in the extreme North of Asia). The biologists found that the body temperature of hibernating Northern (Eptesicus nilssoni) and Brown bats (Plecotus auritus) only slightly differed from the ambient; both the bat’s body temperature and the environmental temperature trailed each other precisely between two and zero degrees Celsius (35.6 and 32 deg-F). The team also report that the periods of hypothermia in bats lasted for 2 ½ weeks and that -- in principle at least -- bat hibernation resembles that seen in rodents. Intriguingly, the paper also notes that, despite the common sight of hundreds of bats grouped close together in a roost during periods of rest, the hibernating bats observed during this study hibernated singularly, with distances of ten to several hundred metres separating them.",1.0220576524734497],["A nutrient that's common to all living things can make hibernating marmots hungry - a breakthrough that could help scientists understand human obesity and eating disorders, according to a new study by a Colorado State University ...",1.0155861377716064],["A nutrient that's common to all living things can make hibernating marmots hungry - a breakthrough that could help scientists understand human obesity and eating disorders, according to a new study by a Colorado State University ...",1.0155861377716064],["The Centre will assist them to cope with the difficulties they face in carrying out the activities of daily living, which many of us take for granted;",0.9961321949958801],["Almost all living things that are classified as plants carry out photosynthesis.

This is counterbalanced by its high reproductive rate. Breeding is seasonal, and distinct vocalizations are used to prevent hybridization with species that overlap its range. Gestation lasts approximately 60 days, and typically two young are born. The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year.
