Rain gauges are placed in open areas where there are no obstructions. Rain gauges do have limitations. During hurricanes, high winds make liquid measurements in rain gauges impossible. Also, when the temperature approaches freezing (0°C), liquid may freeze around the rain gauge and block the opening. A common type of rain gauge used at weather stations is the heated tipping bucket. This rain gauge melts frozen precipitation around the opening and keeps the precipitation in liquid form when it enters the bucket. As rain enters the funnel of the tipping bucket rain gauge, the rain drips into one of the two buckets that are balanced on a pivot below the funnel. When the bucket tips, it triggers a reed switch which sends data back to the weather station on the amount of precipitation in the bucket.  However, the heating element can cause evaporation of small amounts of rain before it gets to the measuring funnel.  Also, the tipping bucket can jam or overflow in high-intensity rain like thunderstorms, which can cause errors in the precipitation amount.",1.0866049528121948],["Because the eudiometer was originally used to measure the amount of oxygen in the air, which was thought to be greater in \"nice\" weather, the root \"eudio-\" appropriately describes the apparatus.",1.085631251335144],["THE MEANING OF ACID RAIN Acid rain is the popular term used to describe acid precipitation.",1.0764336585998535],["The term \"acid rain\" is used to describe rain or snow that has a pH lower than what is natural for a given area.",1.0764336585998535],["EPA: Acid Rain \" Acid rain' is a broad term used to describe several ways that acids fall out of the atmosphere.",1.0764336585998535],["Acid Rain Chemistry As mentioned earlier, the term acid rain is used to describe a variety of different types of acidic deposition.",1.0764336585998535],["The term \"acid rain\" is used to describe rain or snow that has a pH lower than what is natural for a given area.",1.0764336585998535],["The term Tap is widely used to describe the valve used to dispense draft beer from a keg, whether gravity feed or pressurized.",1.070058822631836],["Seismometer Seismograph Richter scale Electrical resistivity devices The term used to describe the amount of energy released by an earthquake is called: Mercalli scale Magnitude Intensity Richter scale This scale is a numerical, logarithmic scale of earthquake magnitude in which the difference between two consecutive whole numbers reflects a tenfold increase in the amount of ground motion.",1.065463900566101],["An IEP team may use either short-term objectives (that generally break the skills described in the annual goal down into discrete components) or benchmarks (which can be thought of as describing the amount of progress the child is expected to make within specified segments of the year), or a combination of the two, depending on the nature of the annual goals and the needs of the child.",1.0630855560302734],["An IEP team may use either short-term objectives (that generally break the skills described in the annual goal down into discrete components) or benchmarks (which can be thought of as describing the amount of progress the child is expected to make within specified segments of the year), or a combination of the two, depending on the nature of the annual goals and the needs of the child.",1.0630855560302734],["An IEP team may use either short&#8209;term objectives (that generally break the skills described in the annual goal down into discrete components) or benchmarks (which can be thought of as describing the amount of progress the child is expected to make within specified segments of the year), or a combination of the two, depending on the nature of the annual goals and the needs of the child.",1.0630855560302734],["Rob Fletcher uses the opening paragraph, in which Bradbury describes the rain of Venus with phrases like: \"It was a hard rain, a perpetual rain, a sweating and steaming rain;",1.0628526210784912],["Mr. Winterling, who studied meteorology in the Air Force and used to work for the National Weather Service, knows his town so well he can predict which streets will flood under specific amounts of rain.",1.0627243518829346],["more articles MetService is an ISO 9001 Certified Company Forecast Index Forecast Area Maps Forecast Terminology Terms &amp;
