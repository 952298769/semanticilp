that when people switched from foraging to farming, they escaped the pressures of a precarious existence and suddenly &quot;had the time&quot; to develop &quot;civilized&quot; features like art, literature, science, and technology but now you know that it was quite the reverse farmers have less free time than foragers so we need some more sophisticated explanation for the development of civilization Agriculture allows people settle in one place (become sedentary ), and creates reasons for them to do so It allows them to settle because agriculture can provide enough food in a limited area that the food is not exhausted before the next season replenishes it so people don't have to move in order to get food It encourages them to settle because fields must be tilled, weeded, irrigated, harvested, etc., which requires people to be there at many different times during the year harvests produce a lot of food at one time, which has to be stored for use over a longer period staying near the stored food is easier than carrying it around stored food, fields, canals, etc. may need to be defended In some particularly good environments, foragers can be sedentary or semi-sedentary, too but this is not common, and usually involves extreme specialization on one or a few very productive wild resources in specially favored places agriculture, on the other hand, allows people to become sedentary in many different environments Agriculture and sedentism tend to lead to population growth They tend to increase fertility for biological reasons Increased carbohydrate consumption from agricultural crops may keep body fat levels high enough to increase fertility (or at least not periodically reduce it) foragers often get very lean during the season of scarcity (it varies in different regions), which reduces female fertility this is an effect familiar to female runners and dancers Less mobile mothers have fewer spontaneous abortions Less mobile mothers don't have to carry their small children constantly, encouraging them to stop breast feeding sooner this shortens the period of reduced fertility due to breast feeding Since the mother does not have to carry her infant around while foraging, sedentism makes it practical for a woman to have more than one infant at a time, allowing larger families mothers are not forced to take measures to prevent having another infant while a previous one is still small such as abstinence rules, contraceptive measures, induced abortions, or infanticide, all of which were practiced by at least some foragers Agriculture also provides economic incentives to have more children Farming creates a greater demand for labor, that is, kids to help with the work So farmers tend to have large families, and the population tends to grow Soon they are locked in: people can't give up farming without causing hardship or starvation because there are more people than the available land could support by foraging So the shift to farming is to some extent a one-way change there is no going back without unacceptable disaster Agriculture and sedentism have surprising effects on nutrition and health agriculture, especially in its early stages, often focuses on one or a small number of the most productive crops this results in a less varied diet than foragers eat and often poorer nutrition overall more carbohydrates lead to more dental caries (cavities), abscesses, etc. - a serious matter before modern dentistry more labor leads to more arthritis and other wear-and-tear ailments living in permanent villages creates new problems of sanitation (waste disposal, insect infestation, etc.) that encourage disease living in larger groups aids the spread of epidemic diseases ovarall, settled agricultural lifestyles typically increase biological stress on people and often decrease lifespan more children are produced, but they have a shorter life expectancy in theory, these two trends could cancel each other out but the observed pattern is that in most or all cases, the net effect is still a population increase Agriculture and sedentism have cultural effects, too: Agriculture requires investment of labor to make a plot of land productive land that has been cleared, tilled, etc. is more valuable than the rest of the countryside so people will tend to claim ownership of improved land, and become tied to it for at least a season, and often longer Sedentism allows accumulation of material goods: storage of goods and food thus the origins of rich and poor people and classes so

Item 2 INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION PLACE DU PETIT-SACONNEX 1211 GENEVA 19 POLICIES AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THE RIGHT TO FOOD IN THIS TIME OF GLOBALIZATION OF THE ECONOMY AND TRADE LIBERALIZATION Resolution adopted by consensus by the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (Beijing, 20 September 1996) The 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Recalling Article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that &quot;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food...&quot;, Noting with concern that close to 800 million people in developing countries suffer from chronic undernutrition, and almost 200 million children under five from protein and energy deficiencies and that as many as 88 nations fall in the category of low-income food-deficit countries, and also noting with concern that the problem of food shortages has worsened since the 1974 World Food Conference, particularly in recent years, and that no tangible progress has been made in achieving the main goal of that Conference, Taking note of the recommendations and resolutions adopted by United Nations conferences concerning development and food security, particularly the Programme of Action adopted by the World Food Conference (1992), the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development (1994) and the principles adopted at the World Summit for Social Development (1995), Expressing the hope that, at the World Food Summit due to take place in Rome in November 1996, world leaders, addressing the problem of food security at the highest level, will elaborate effective policies and strategies, Underscoring that the grave situation that has arisen from the drop in world food production, the exhaustion of a great many stocks and the fall in food supplies to a level which is close to being critical for food security, is a threat to all countries and in particular the developing ones, Stressing the need for a global assessment of food and agricultural problems, in particular in the developing countries, which takes account of the short- and long-term risks of conflict, Recognizing that food insecurity and poverty are fundamentally interrelated and must be addressed within a broad framework that encompasses social concerns and economic growth, Also recognizing the negative effects that distortionary agricultural policies have had on agricultural production, investment and trade, and food security, Convinced that women play a key role, especially in the agricultural sector of the developing countries, and that their empowerment would therefore significantly contribute to improving food security, Acknowledging the role of trade in promoting economic growth and in providing the wherewithal for poverty alleviation and the capacity to secure food supplies, Deeming that the persistently difficult economic situation in many countries, especially the unfavourable trends in the food and agricultural sectors, calls for forceful measures at the national and international level with a view to promoting and ensuring economic recovery and development, Recognizing that stepping up food production, in particular in net food-importing developing countries, improves food self-sufficiency \nand is therefore very important to the achievement of food security, Concerned at the persistent difficulties which the majority of developing countries are experiencing owing to a number of insoluble problems such as unfavourable long-term trends in international commodity prices, protectionism, deteriorating terms of trade, the growing debt servicing burden, the imbalance between net transfers of resources to and from developing countries, all of which have had a deleterious effect on international trade and agriculture, Noting that the Uruguay Round results recognize, in particular in the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing Countries, that, despite the positive impact of economic growth and trade liberalization on overall food security, the reform process could adversely affect some least developed net food-importing countries in the short term, and emphasizing that the phasing-out of the subsidies which the developed countries grant for agricultural products can have grave consequences, Expressing its concern at the current decline in donations, official development assistance and foreign aid, particularly to the agricultural sectors of the developing countries, Stressing that the world's current main food and agricultural problems have a number of root causes, including weak overall development, particularly in the agricultural and rural sectors, population growth, inadequate purchasing power, poverty and poor distribution systems, challenges to food supplies from civil strife, harvest failure and other unforeseen occurrences, as well as the absence of a favourable economic climate, all of which are reflected by a lack of food security, 1.",0.8868857622146606],["He sailed around the world on these two ships seven times, taking young people, and I knew many of
