days meting with a Buffaloe now and then which furnished us with provision for at least one meal each day our luck was to fall in with the Oglela tiribe of Sioux whare traded a few more horses and swaped of some of our more ordinay \"Country nearly the same short grass and plenty of cactus untill we crossed the Chienne River a few miles below whare it leaves the Black Hill range of Mountains here some aluvial lands look like they might bear cultivation we did not keep near enough to the hills for a rout to travel on and again \nfell into a tract of county whare no vegetation of any kind existed beeing worn into knobs and gullies and extremely uneven a loose grayish coloured soil verry soluble in water running thick as it could move of a pale whitish coular and remarkably adhesive there on a misty rain while we were in this pile of ashes and it loded down our horses feet (feet) in great lumps it looked a little remarkable that not a foot of level land could be found the narrow revines going in all manner of directions and the cobble mound of a regular taper from top to bottom all of them of the percise same angle and the tops share the whole of this region is moveing to the Misourie River as fast as rain and thawing of Snow can carry it by enclining a little to the west in a few hours we got on to smoothe ground and soon cleared ourselves of mud at length we arived at the foot of the black Hills which rises in verry slight elevation about the common plain we entered a pleasant undulating pine Region cool and refreshing so different from the hot dusty planes we have been so long passing over and here we found hazlenuts and ripe plumbs a luxury not expected We had one two day travel over undulating Pine with here and there an open glade of rich soill and fine grass but assinding the Ridges unill we arived near the summet our rout became brushy mainly Scruby pine and Juniper the last covered in purple beries comencing our desent the ravines became steep and rugged an rockey the waters flowing westward we suposed we ware on the waters of Powder river one evening late gowing dwn a small stream we came into a Kenyon and pushed ouselves down so far that (that) our horses had no room to turn while looking for a way out it became dark by unpacking and leading our animals down over Slipery rocks three of us got down to a nce open glade whare we killed a Buffaloe and fared Sumpiously that night while the rest of the Company remained in the Kenyon without room to lie down we now found it would not do to follow down any stream in these moutains as we ware shure to meet with rocky inaccessible places So with great exertion we again assended to the top of a ridge and ware Quite lucky in gitting a main devide which led us a considerable distance before had to desend again but this portion of the mountain fumished our horses with no food and they began to be verry poor and weak so we left 3 men and five horses behind to recruit while the rest of us proceded on there being some sighn of Beaver in the vicinity and hoping to soon find more where we Might all Stop for a time The Crow Indians being our place of destination a half Breed by the name of Rose who spoke the crow tongue was dispached ahead to find the Crows and try to induce some of them to come to our assistance we to travel directly west as near as circumstances would permit supposing we ware on the waters of Powder River we ought to be within the bounds of the Crow country continueing five days travel since leaveing our given out horses and likewise Since Rose left us late in the afternoon while passing through a Brushy bottom a large Grssely came down the vally we being in single file men on foot leding pack horses he struck us about the center then turning ran paralel to our line Capt. Smith being in the advanc he ran to the open ground and as he immerged from the thicket he and the bear met face to face Grissly did not hesitate a moment but sprung on the capt taking him by the head first pitcing sprawling on the earth he gave him a grab by the middle fortunately cathing by the ball pouch and Butcher Kife which he broke but breaking several of his ribs and cutting his head badly none of us having any sugical Knowledge what was to be done one Said come take hold and he wuld say why not you so it went around I asked Capt what was best he said one or 2 for water and if you have a needle and thread git it out and sew up my wounds around my head which was bleeding freely I got a pair of scissors and cut off his hair and then began my first Job of dessing wounds upon examination I the bear had taken nearly all his head in his capcious mouth close to his left eye on one side and clos to his right ear on the other and laid the skull bare to near the crown of the head leaving a white streak whare his teeth passed one of his ears was torn from his head out to the outer rim after stitching all the other wounds in the best way I was capabl and according to the captains directions the ear being the last I told him I could do nothing for his Eare 0 you must try to stich up some way or other said he then \nI put in my needle stiching it through and through and over and over laying the lacerated parts togather as nice as I could with my hands water was found in about ame mille when we all moved down and encamped the captain being able to mount his horse and ride to camp whare we pitched a tent the onley one we had and made him as comfortable as circumtances would permit this gave us a lisson on the charcter of the grissly Baare which we did not forget I now a found time to ride around and explore the immediate surroundings of our camp and assertained that we ware still on the waters of shiann river which heads almost in the eastern part of the Black hill range taking a western course for a long distance into an uneven vally whare a large portion of (of) the waters are sunk or absorbd then turning short to the east it enters the Black hill rang though a narrow Kenyon in appeareantly the highest and most abrupt part of the mountain enclosed in immence cliffs of the most pure and Beautifull black smooth and shining and perhaps five hunded to one thousand feet high how this slate extends I cannot tell We passe through this slate Quary about 2 miles and one of the men observed here or at some such place Mosses must have obtaind the plates or tables on which the declogue was inscirobed some miles farther west I visited place of a different character containing Quite a grove of Petrifid timber standing laying and inclining at various angles one stub in Perticular wa so high that I could barely lay my hand on the top sitting in the saddle the body and main branches scatered on the ground dismouted and picked up several fragments which ware so hard so to bring fire fom steel A mountaneer named Harris being St Louis some yers after undertook to describe some of the strange things seen in the mountains spoke of this petrified grove in a restaurant whare a caterer for one of the dailys was preset and the next morning his exagerated statement came out saying a petrified forest was lately dicovered whare the trees branches leaves and all were perfect and the small birds sitting on them with their mouths open singing at the time of their transformation to stone This is a fine country for game Buffaloe Elk Bare deer antelope &amp;c likewise it produces some Hazel nuts Plumbs white thorn Berries wild currant large and of fine flavour and abundance of nutricious grass and some land that would bear cultivation after remaining here ten days or 2 weeks the capt. Began to ride out a few miles and as winter was rapidly approaching we began to make easy travel west ward and Struck the trail of Shian Indians the next day we came to their village traded and swaped a few horses with them and continued our march across a Ridge mountains not steep &amp; rocky (in general) but smooth and grassy in general with numerous springs and brook of pure water and well stocked with game dsending this ridge we came to the waters of Powder River Running West and north country mountainous and some what rockey \"Rose with 15 or 16 Crow Indians came to our camp as soon as we raised a fire in the evenin they had been watching for two days passed to assure themselves that no Shians were with us they and the Shians being at war they the Crows brought us several spare Horses which relieved our Broke down animals and gave us a chance to ride but they caused us to travel to fast for our poor horses and so Capt Smith gave them what they could pack sending Rose with them and we followed at our own gait stoping and Traping for beaver occasionly Crossing several steep and high ridges which in any other country would be called mountains Crossed Shell river Quite a stream running into the bighorn as I believe the mountains here do not appear to have any rigular direction but run in all directions are tolerable high but not generall precipitous Before laving this perticular Region I think it the Best Suppied with game of any we passe through in all our Travels and therefore do not wonder that the Indian would not give it up and if it is not too cold there some soil that will bear cultivation we ware there through the month of November the nights war frosty but the days ware generally warm and pleasant on Tongue river we struck the trail of the (of the) Crow Indians Passed over another ridge of mountains we came on to Wind River which is merely another name for the Big horn above the Big horn Mountain the most of this Region is barren and worthless if my recollection is right from the heads of the Shian untill we came on to Wind river we ware Bountifully supplied with game but here we found none at all two causes may be assigned for this first the country not being well supplied naturely an Second the Crows haveing passed recntly through they had killed and drove off all the game in our reach our meals being few and far betwen our only hope being to push a head and overtake the \nCrow village The weather being cold and blustry and I thought the River was well named slight Snows and Strong north winds prevailed continually our horses and

similarities to vertebrate brain: 1) generally larger than any other part of invertebrate CNS 2) brain is morphologically and functionally specialized Connectives Join CNS ganglia Most axons small,

organization \nof invertebrate CNS Invertebrate CNS exhibits highly specific organization, often possible to identify the same specific neuron in different individuals of same species Brain in invertebrate plays same functional role as brain of vertebrate, to process sensory information, to make decision and to organize motor output Some invertebrate brains highly sophisticated, with specialized regions for functions such as memory Vertebrate spinal cord Lies in dorsally situated vertebral column from base of brain to pelvis White matter Bundles of myelinated axons, that mostly connect parts of the cord with one another or with the brain each tract or column carries specific sensory or motor information dorsally located columns generally carry sensory information up to brain ventrally located columns generally carry motor commands down from brain Gray matter Cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses ventral horns contain motor neuron cell bodies, innervate somatic muscles via ventral root nerves dorsal horn contains neurons that receive sensory input via peripheral nerves lateral regions of gray matter contain cell bodies of efferent autonomic neurons Spinal nerves most sensory information enters cord via dorsal roots each dorsal root contains swelling, dorsal root ganglion, containing cell bodies of sensory neurons motor information leaves the cord via ventral roots dorsal and ventral roots fuse close to spinal cord to form spinal nerves, run out between vertebrae of backbone spinal nerves are identified and numbered according to the part of the cord they serve and position in that part The vertebrate brain Located in head and supervises much or all of animal's behavior In vertebrates and invertebrates brain size roughly scaled with body size Brain tends to be larger and more complex in relation to body size in mammals and birds than in fish and amphibians In mammals, and in humans in particular, size of forebrain, including cerebral cortex increased

places in different individuals Larger ones invariant landmarks Gray matter at outer surface of brain- cortex Fiber tracts, white matter underneath Nuclei distinct collections of cell bodies Brain Development Neural tube Brain and spinal cord originate from neural tube that runs length of embryo Anterior end of neural tube develops three distinct lobes- forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) Forebrain becomes telencephalon and diencephalon Hindbrain becomes cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata The brain of the leopard frog Development of human brain During second month of development, tube begins to buckle or flex in several places 35-50 days medulla and metencephalon grow rapidly forcing junction between them into ventral bend about 50 days anterior telencephalon begins period of enormous growth, eventually growing over and enclosing much of rest of brain, becomes cerebral hemispheres Central core and external coverings of brain Hollow center of neural tube develops into central canal of spinal cord and ventricles of brain Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A clear colorless fluid, containing ions but devoid of protein and blood cells fills ventricles and circulates over surface of brain, cushions brain against shock of impact, provides suitable chemical environment for neural tissue Meninges Layers of tissue that surround, support, and protect brain Produce and aid in the circulation of CSF Blood-brain barrier Cells that line blood vessels in brain form especially tight seals with one another, making it difficult or impossible for substances in blood to enter brain tissue, additional protection in lining of ventricles Critical for keeping brain tissue isolated from metabolites and toxins in blood The lower brain Brainstem Medulla, pons, and midbrain form a linear arrangement, and therefore referred to as brainstem Cerebellum is also part of the hindbrain, but not considered part of brainstem, because not in line with other components Medulla and pons Nuclei Contain nuclei that help to control basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and initiating reflexive actions- coughing, gagging, vomiting Medullary and pontine nuclei associated with cranial nerves, contain cell bodies of motor neurons whose axons leave brain via some of the cranial nerves Fiber tracts some nerve tracts connect brain stem nuclei with one another, some connect nuclei in brain stem to the spinal cord or brain, some go straight through brainstem, connecting spinal to nuclei in midbrain and forebrain pyramidal tracts ventrally located, carry information from motor centers of forebrain to motor centers of spinal cord, corticospinal tracts convey information from brain to spinal cord, spinocortical tracts convey information from spinal cord to brain Reticular formation or reticular activating system Loose network forming a number of biochemically and morphologically distinct groups within the brainstem, that communicate extensively with one another, as well as with other parts of the brain Functions: modulate sensation of pain modulate certain postural reflexes and muscle tone help control breathing and heartbeat to regulate the level of brain arousal and, in humans, consciousness Raphe nuclei Lie along midline of medulla, pons, and midbrain, are especially important in maintaining wakefulness, damage can result in permanent coma All sensory input that enters the medulla also sent to neurons of reticular formation, may monitor sensory input for importance, and alert higher brain centers when critical input is detected Input from cortex may aid in decisions The Cranial nerves I Olfactory nerve - sensory, supplies olfactory input to olfactory bulb II Optic nerve - sensory, supplies visual input to lateral geniculate, among other places III Oculomotor nerve - motor, controls most eye muscles, output from mesencephalon IV Troclear nerve - motor, controls superior oblique muscle of eye, output from mesencephalon V Trigeminal nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the face, controls muscles that move the jaw, connections with mesencephalon, pons and medulla VI Abducens nerve - motor, controls external rectus eye muscles, output from pons VII Facial nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the toungue and palate, controls the muscles of the face, connections with pons and medulla VIII Vestibulocochlear - sensory, carries auditory and balance \ninput, input to pons and medulla IX Glossopharyngeal nerve - mixed, carries sensory input from the tongue and throat, controls throat muscles, connections with pons and medulla X Vagus nerve - Mixed (autonomic) carries sensory input from the heart, lungs, and viscera, controls movements of the heart, lungs, and viscera, connections with pons and medulla XI Accessory nerve - motor, controls neck muscles, output from medulla XII Hypoglossal - motor, controls tongue and neck muscles, output from medulla The Cerebellum Known functions: 1) coordinating motor action 2) learning and memory of motor tasks 3) possibly certain types of cognitive tasks How these functions carried out not known Cerebellar peduncles bundles of thousands of axons that connect cerebellum to brainstem and send information to and from it Cerebellar cortex three layers contains only a few distinct cell types neurons and inputs arranged in an extraordinarily regular array receives input from just two types of neurons 1) climbing fibers from inferior olivary nucleus of medulla 2) mossy fibers from other brain nuclei Purkinje cells output from cerebellar cortex to cerebellar nuclei Cerebellar nuclei, in turn, send output to other areas of brain Knowledge of cerebellar function comes from brain lesion studies in animals and accidents in humans reduced muscle tone and balance following damage to some parts of cerebellum, these parts involved in muscle tone and balance during voluntary and reflexive movements shaking and slowness or difficulty in executing movements associated with damage to other portions of cerebellum learning and memory related to motor tasks cerebellum may be involved in cognitive tasks that require mental manipulation of spatial relationships The midbrain Optic tectum/superior colliculus- optic tectum prominent in non-mammals, major visual center in frogs, fish detecting and selecting targets for orienting movements of body, eyes Torus semicircularis/inferior colliculus- torus located in tegmentum in non-mammals, inferior colliculus located on dorsal midbrain posterior to superior colliculus, auditory processing structure Tegmentum portion of midbrain that lies under cerebral aqueduct contains red nucleus and substantia nigra important in orientation reflexes, maintaining posture, and voluntary movements, substantia nigra damaged in Parkinson's disease, a motor disorder The diencephalon The \"lower\" part of the forebrain, largely covered by telencephalic structures in many vertebrates, consists mainly of thalamus and hypothalamus Thalamus i mportant relay station for sensory information en route to the appropriate cortical center, specific regions process input from specific sense organs Lateral geniculate nuclei- receive input from the optic nerves of the eyes Medial geniculate nuclei- receive auditory information Other thalamic nuclei receive input from reticular formation, project to cerebral cortex, some participate in motor control Hypothalamus Regulate internal state of body to maintain conditions necessary for life Homeostasis-maintaining a relatively constant internal state, regulation of body temperature, blood pressure, salt and water levels Hypothalamus involved in homeostasis in three ways: 1) initiate or surpress behaviors such as eating or drinking that affect internal body conditions 2) regulates pituitary gland, exerts control over endocrine system, which in turn adjusts many internal conditions such as salt and water balance in blood 3) regulates many homeostatic conditions by control of autonomic system, which influences factors such as blood pressure and body temperature hypothalamus also part of system necessary for expression of emotions, emotional reactions in mammals involve extensive changes in factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory patterns the telencephalon of the frog is relatively simple, and consists of a pallium, striatum, and septum.",0.486801415681839],["Username: Password: Post as &quot;Anonymous&quot;
