spines or hooks that help them adhere to fur or feathers C] FRUITS - GREEN VS. RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off
