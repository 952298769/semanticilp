Long Bone - femur - Short Bone - Flat Bone - Irregular Bone Parts of a Long Bone - Diaphysis - shaft - composed primarily of Compact Bone - strong, dense, solid bone - contains a thin layer of Spongy Bone - has many spaces for supporting bone marrow - has a Medullary (Marrow) Cavity - large internal space - stores yellow bone marrow - adipose tissue - Epiphysis - semi-rounded ends of a long bone - made primarily of spongy (cancellous) bone - contains red bone marrow - for hematopoiesis - Metaphysis - narrow zone that connects the diaphsis with the epiphysis - Endosteum - layer of bone cells that line the medullary cavity, and the small spaces in spongy and compact bone - Periosteum - double layer of connective tissue that covers the superficial surface of bone - near a joint, the periosteum becomes continuous with connective tissues that join bones together (ligaments and tendons) Bone Histology - you are responsible for knowing the components of an osteon - Haversian Canal,
