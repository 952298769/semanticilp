When a plant or animal dies, the nutrients and energy are entrapped in their bodies. Decomposers feed on these carcasses, and leave behind unused energy and nutrients, which are present in both unconsumed portions like bones, feathes or fur in case of animals and  in  wood and other indigestable materials in case of plants. Decomposers convert all organic matter into carbon dioxide and nutrients in a form usable to plants. The raw nutrients are  mainly composed of nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium. Plant cells incorporate these chemicals into their cells during photosynthesis. Therefore the nutrients are resupplied and form primary energy production. These nutrients are useful and support the growth of producers .
