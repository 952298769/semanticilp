[["The structure of these action/prediction associations adapts to the complexity of the environmental physics (e.g. the force exerted by the weight of a ball in the hand, measured interactively by releasing, then stopping the motion of the hand while it holds the ball, predicts the direction the ball will fall when it is dropped).",1.775253415107727],["Dropping Coffee Filters : Modern physics began when, some 500 years ago, Galileo Galilei dropped metal balls of different sizes from the \"leaning tower\" of Pisa, and observed [or at least claimed to see] that they hit the ground at the same time, in contrast to expectations that the heavier ball would fall more quickly.",1.7401816844940186],["According to Aristotle's physics, the ball dropped should land at the stern of the ship as it falls straight down from the point of origin.",1.5907840728759766]]
