deep-beaked birds more often die as juveniles this is not well explained, but may be because they have slightly higher food requirements while they are growing during the normal, wet years, there was a balance between the mortality of the shallowest-beaked birds due to their greater difficulty finding food as adults, and the mortality of the deepest-beaked birds due to their difficulty finding food as juveniles birds with average-sized beaks were the ones most likely to survive natural selection was balanced, or &quot;stable&quot;, so it maintained the status quo this situation is called an &quot;equilibrium&quot; During the drought, the benefit of having a deep beak increased, but the cost apparently did not increase as much so having a deep beak became advantageous and the selection ceased to be &quot;stabilizing&quot;, but instead became &quot;directional&quot;, favoring birds with deep beaks Stabilizing and directional selection are essentially the same process the only difference is whether the optimal characteristic is already the most common, or not as long as more individuals are born than survive and reproduce, selection is always going on Boyd and Silk point out that stasis (staying the same) is no more &quot;natural&quot; than change both require explanation, which the theory of evolution gives us The finch example illustrates that species are not fixed, unchanging types of organisms instead, species are populations of organisms with individuals that are different from each other what defines the species is the distribution of various characteristics among the individuals who make up the population -- what traits are common, what traits are rare, what is the average of traits like beak depth this distribution of traits many change over time, if directional selection occurs, or may remain constant, if stabilizing selection occurs Finally, notice that natural selection acts on individuals , not the group Individual organisms live or die, reproduce or don't and the result is shifting distributions of traits like beak depth that reflect the results of this selection among individuals This process of selection of individuals does have a net effect on the population, but the actual process works individual by individual, not on the group as a whole This distinction is important, because it shows that natural selection does not consider how the traits affect the group or the species as a whole natural selection, acting on individuals, might favor traits that are advantageous for individual organisms, but are disadvantageous for the group as a whole natural selection can even drive the whole group to extinction Consider Boyd and Silk's hypothetical example of high-fecundity vs. low-fecundity females (fecundity is the ability to produce offspring) high-fecundity females produce more offspring;",1.442195177078247],["The study was conducted on one of the Galapagos islands, Daphne Major, in the Pacific far off the coast of Ecuador The birds are medium ground finches ( Geospiza fortis ), which mostly eat seeds The Grants' project captured, banded, and recorded measurements and other information about all the birds on the island over a number of years, and also recorded other information about the environment, especially the availability of different kinds of seeds Early in the study, the island received a lot of rain, but then is suffered a severe drought, which drastically affected the availability of the seeds that the birds ate This provided a great opportunity to watch natural selection in action During the drought, the plants on the island produced many fewer of the small, soft varieties of seeds that the finches prefer The finches quickly ate most of the small, soft types of seeds This left mostly larger, harder seeds, which many of the birds found difficult to eat The drought made it obvious that Darwin's first postulate was being met: more birds were born than survived long enough to reporoduce The food shortage caused many birds to starve to death The finch population declined from 1200 birds to 180 birds in just two years of drought This was obviously a severe case, but not anything unusual in the real world The Grants' measurements showed that there was variation in the depth (height) of the finches beaks there was a normal, smooth distribution of beak depths, ranging from relatively shallow beaks to relatively deep ones and they observed that birds with different beak depths preferred different kinds of seeds birds with shallow beaks preferred smaller, softer seeds presumably because their beaks were not strong enough to break into the larger, harder seeds birds with deeper beaks preferred larger, harder seeds presumably because there were more of them around, and these birds were able to crack them with their stronger (deeper) beaks They might also have preferred the larger seeds because they have more food content per seed So, the variation in beak depth caused a variation in fitness when small seeds were scarce birds with shallow beaks had trouble finding enough food birds with deeper beaks were more likely to find enough food so birds with deeper beaks were more likely to survive during the drought That is, Darwin's second postulate was also being met: the birds varied in how well suited they were to find food during the drought This is illustrated by figure 1.9 in the text Fig 1.9a shows that the deeper the beak, the more likely the bird was to survive during the drought years Fig 1.9b shows the distribution of beak depths during the early, wet years, and the distribution of beak depths after a year of drought more of the birds with shallow beaks have died off, leaving a population with relatively more deep-beaked birds that is, the average beak depth increased Finally, the Grants compared the beak depths of birds and their offspring, and found that beak depth was inherited: Darwin's third postulate, that offspring tend to resemble their parents, was also working in nature They showed that shallow-beaked birds tended to produce shallow-beaked offspring, and deep-beaked birds tended to produce deep-beaked offspring This is no surprise, of course but it is absolutely necessary for the theory to work otherwise, the offspring would not reflect the traits that had been selected for in the parents So, after two years of drought, the new generation of finches being hatched had beaks that averaged deeper than the chicks of just two years earlier In two years, the average beak depth increased by 4% This is evolution caught in the act And not even the slow, gradual evolution we usually think of Imagine what would happen to human stature if selection caused it to increase this same 4% every two generations In twenty generations, the average height would increase 48%!",1.3909430503845215],["The shape and form of their beaks and feet provide valuable clues through observation that allow us to infer or predict to which habitat and food source a particular bird with a certain beak type would be most successfully adapted.",1.211852788925171],["we generally don't find a nice sequence of fossils leading from one species to the next this is to be expected if most of the time, species stay about the same, and only occasionally do new ones form the number of individuals involved in the transition will be very few, compared to those involved in the period of stability, so the chances of finding fossils of the transitional individuals will be very low but evolutionary theory suggests some possibilities about how new species could form But first, we need two more useful concepts: character displacement and reinforcement these are not in themselves processes of speciation but they come in handy for understanding the processes of speciation that we are about to look at character displacement : a mechanism that may increase the existing differences in characteristics between two variant populations that are in competition with each other say two populations of birds have diverged considerably, such that one is well adapted to a wet environment, and the other to a dry environment if they are allowed to mix again, the dry-adapted individuals will be favored in dry areas, and the wet-adapted individuals will be favored in wet areas any wet-adapted birds who were a bit towards the dry-adapted end of their population's range of variation will have strong competition from the dry-adapted birds and vice versa that is, any individuals who happen to be more intermediate in character will be out-competed by their own kind in their native environment, and by the other kind in the other environment so individuals who tend to be intermediate in type will be selected against, and the two populations will evolve apart towards adaptations that are specialized for their own ecological niche character displacement clearly does occur in nature see the three charts on page 102 some islands have only medium ground finches, which have relatively deep beaks other islands have only small ground finches, which have relatively shallow beaks still other islands have both kinds of finches but when both kinds are present, the small ground finches have even shallower beaks and the medium ground finches have even deeper beaks that is, the characteristics that distinguish the two species are more exaggerated on islands where they live together presumed \nreason: character displacement those small finches that have beaks on the large end of their normal range are out-competed for the large seeds by the even deeper-beaked medium finches that is, they pay the costs of a small finch with a deep beak, but the other species beats them out of the benefit of getting the larger seeds so they do not survive and reproduce as well, and the average beak depth of the small finch goes down those medium finches that have beaks on the small end of their normal range are out-competed for smaller seeds by the small finches so the average beak depth of the medium finches goes up reinforcement : a mechanism that can increase the reproductive isolation between two variant populations that might still interbreed reinforcement can occur in a situation in which hybrids (offspring of matings between parents of two different types) are less successful than offspring of mates of the same type such as the case with the small finches and the medium finches, in which the hybrids lose out in competition with either purebred type in this case, selection will favor individuals who tend to mate with their own kind, and avoid mating with the other kind because they produce fewer of the less-fit hybrids, and more of the successful purebred offspring individuals who tend to mate with their own kind (and not the other kind) will produce more successful offspring those offspring will also inherit the tendency to mate with their own kind, since their parents had that preference so the tendency to mate with their own kind will become more common so eventually the populations become largely or completely isolated from each other from that point on, there is no mixing (no gene flow), so the two populations are free to evolve further off in their own directions the behavior that leads to this tendency to mate with one's own kind could be anything, as long as it has that effect it might be that the pure-breeding individuals mate at certain times of the day or year or are attracted to certain mating displays or physical features or anything else that results in their more often picking their own kind to mate with both of these processes serve to exaggerate or accelerate speciation, or help to lock-in changes that are leading to speciation we will look at three processes of speciation allopatric speciation: \"in different countries\" parapatric speciation: \"in neighboring countries\" sympatric speciation: \"in the same country\" these differ mainly in the amount of physical separation they require between the diverging populations allopatric speciation : speciation that occurs when two populations that are geographically isolated from each other diverge far enough to form distinct species \"allopatric\": \"in different countries\" that is, the two populations are separated by a physical barrier or great distance, like lizards on two different islands, or fish in two different lakes causing them to be reproductively isolated from each other if the selection pressures on the two isolated populations are different, they may evolve in different directions until the two populations are sufficiently different to be called separate species another hypothetical bird example finches from a wet island get blown to a dry

selection explains the gradual modification of continuously variable traits Mendel's theory of inheritance explains the inheritance of dichotomous traits The modern synthesis explains how the two are really special cases of the same model The key idea: while dichotomous traits are controlled by just one pair of alleles at a single locus... continuously varying traits are controlled by many pairs of alleles at many different loci, with each locus partially influencing the trait The clearest way to illustrate this requires us to review how alleles interact alleles may be dominant vs. recessive, as in the cases we have focussed on so far in this case, there are three genotypes, but only two phenotypes the dominant one is always fully expressed, if present alleles may also be codominant with codominant alleles, the three genotypes produce three distinct phenotypes the heterozygous genotype usually produces an intermediate phenotype like the flowers with alleles for red color and white color: RR produces a red flower - only the red pigment is present, and lots of it WW produces a white flower - only the white pigment is present, and lots of it RW produces a pink flower - it has some red pigment and some white pigment this is actually a common situation, but since traits with straight dominance have only two forms and are simpler to study, Mendel chose to focus on those and so did we but the logic, Punnett squares, probabilities, etc. all work exactly the same way Now let's consider how Mendelian genetics can explain continuous variation Imagine that beak depth is controlled by one locus with codominant alleles the alleles control the amount of a beak-stimulating hormone H+ (more hormone), contributes to deeper beaks H- (less hormone), contributes to shallower beaks so the genotypes are H+H+ (deep beak) H+ \nH- (intermediate beak) H-H- (shallow beak) This only gives three kinds of beaks, not a continuous distribution it works just like any other Mendelian trait but now, imagine that another allele also affects beak depth by controlling the amount of calcium available for beak formation C+ leads to deeper beaks C- leads to smaller beaks so now the genotypes are H+H+C+C+: biggest beak H+H+C+C-: slightly smaller H+H+C-C-: slightly smaller yet H+H-C+C+: smaller than the biggest, probably not exactly the same as either of the other two, either since the effect of slightly less calcium is probably not quite the same as the effect of slightly less of the hormone H-H-C+C+: smaller than above, probably not exactly the same as the others etc. a relatively small number of alleles quickly gives a large number of combinations, with different cumulative effects in theory, there should be a large number of different beak sizes, but still with a distinctly different size for each combination of alleles however, each genotype does not always produce exactly the same size of beak there will be a range of phenotypes (beak sizes) for each genotype, since the beak size is also affected somewhat by the bird's environment its diet, temperature, etc. so each genotype actually produces a range of beak sizes while the differences between the average size for each genotype are small so this variation fills in the gaps between the beak sizes produced by different genotypes the effect is what looks like continuous variation in the phenotype even though the underlying genotypes are still distinct combinations of alleles Cool result: this means that matings will produce offspring that usually look \"blended\", but sometimes exceed the parents on certain traits: just like what we really observe both parents will generally have a mix of alleles that affect a given trait, like height each will have some alleles that promote taller stature, and others that promote shorter stature the offspring each get a random selection of these alleles from each parent usually, the offspring will get some alleles for tallness, some for shortness, and will come out with a moderate height in fact, since each offspring combines a random sample of the father's alleles and a random sample of the mother's alleles, most offspring will tend to have a mix of alleles that is somewhere intermediate between the parents this looks like blending inheritance but occasionally, just by the luck of the draw, an offspring will happen to get mostly alleles for tallness, or mostly alleles for shortness if an offspring got, say, almost all the father's \"tallness\" alleles and few of his \"shortness\" alleles, and almost all the mother's \"tallness\" alleles and few of her \"shortness\" alleles, the offspring could have a higher percentage of \"tallness\" alleles than either parent this could produce individuals who have traits that exceed those of their parents just as we occasionally see in real offspring this is how Mendelian genetics produces offspring that usually look like blends of most of their parents' traits but sometimes have traits that are not intermediate between their parents This is an important way in which \"new\" variants are produced for natural selection to act on they are not new alleles , but rather new combinations of alleles they may not even really be new combinations, just combinations that are so unlikely by chance that they don't happen very often of course, there is no guarantee that the next generation of offspring will get the same combination in fact, it is very unlikely but if the combination leads to that individual having more offspring, the alleles of the combination will become more common and the more common the alleles become, the more often this combination will turn up...",0.9099570512771606],["Most birds living on vegetable food live on seeds and have a short, stout, conical beak like

an island the island has two areas, one wet and one dry selection favors large beaks in the dry area, and small beaks in the wet area but the finches fly all around the island and interbreed with each other so the birds all are members of a single population although more large-beaked birds survive in the dry area, and more small-beaked birds survive in the wet area, they all mate with each other at random and mix up all their genes in the next generation so the beaks in the next generation are an average, intermediate size the population average does not change, and all the birds remain roughly the same - a single species now imagine that a different species of bird also lives on the island it has a long, narrow beak and a long tongue suited for picking insects out of tree bark the two species of birds share the island, but do not mate with each other: they are reproductively isolated from each other no matter how useful it might be to have a long, narrow beak and tongue and eat insects, the finches will never get these traits from the bug-eating birds the gap between the two species remains clear the finches remain finches, and the bug-eaters remain bug-eaters because they are reproductively isolated from each other the point of the example according to the biological species concept, it is gene flow within the species that keeps all members of the species fairly similar and it is reproductive isolation from other species that allows each species to be different from all others, because no mixing between species occurs a note about reproductive isolation populations may be reproductively isolated in many different, often subtle ways in the most obvious case, they may be so different that they physically cannot mate, or that even if they do, the offspring do not survive or are not fertile but isolation is just as complete if they simply do not mate for some other reason for example, if one population is active in the day, and the other at night or if two populations of birds develop preferences for different colors of feathers, and the birds only choose mates of their own type even though they could be made to successfully mate in a lab or on a farm, if they do not mate in nature, they are effectively isolated The ecological species concept \"A species is a group of organisms that is genetically distinct from other species because any hybrids between species are markedly less successful\" This is a much less common, somewhat radical view but it is worth looking at The ecological species concept says that what keeps all the members of the species similar to each other is not gene flow, but rather stabilizing selection because the selective pressures that created the species in the first place will tend to keep each population the same (stabilizing selection) that is, even if a species is divided into physically isolated populations and there is no gene flow between them, the two populations will still remain the same because they are experiencing the same stabilizing selection pressures the species remain different from other species because if individuals from two different species do successfully mate and

Tinbergen`s gull experiments fig 55.1 Gull parents remove hatched eggshells from nest If broken shells replaced, predation increased White shell interior cues predators Shell removal behavior is adaptive Behavioral Ecology Study of how natural selection shapes behavior Adaptive significance: how behavior increases survival and reproduction Concentration of early studies Habitat selection Avoiding predation Becoming more effective predator Recent studies examine animal`s fitness or reproductive success How behavior is related to fitness = study of adaptation itself Natural selection acts on genetic component of behavioral differences Behavior favoring reproductive success becomes more prevalent over time Test hypothesis by measuring fitness, demonstrating its correlation with behavior May also measure other factors associated with reproduction FORAGING BEHAVIOR Feeding Is One of Most Basic Animal Behaviors Foraging behavior: involved with selection and collection of food Predators may actively hunt, ambush or trap prey fig 55.2 Specialists Versus Generalists Specialists: feed on only one kind of food Example: some ants eat only spider eggs Example: oystercatchers feed on only mussels fig 55.3 Generalists: feed on many different kinds of food Not as efficient as specialists at catching any one kind of food Take advantage of catching many different varieties Behavior is obviously important to growth and reproduction Target of strong evolutionary forces Expect evolution to favor foraging efficiency Calculate net energy of different prey items, size and energy needed for pursuit Predictions made by optimal foraging theory fig 55.4 Animals cannot always maximize energy intake Nutrition and variety of food must be considered Compromises made because of predation by others fig 55.5 SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Definition of Social Behavior Interaction with others of same or different species May be competitive or cooperative Territorial Behavior Home range: daily activity site May overlap with others in time or space May be exclusive and actively defended Territoriality fig 55.6 Individual exclusively uses area with some limited resource Resources may include food or potential mates Defense of area via displays or overt aggression Economic risks of territorial behavior Energy costs versus energy benefits Example: flowers and nectar-feeding birds fig 55.7 If flowers scarce, not worth defending since they do not provide enough energy If abundant, not worth defending, easy to get enough energy Defense practical for intermediate quantity of flowers The Ecology of Reproduction Reproductive strategies: behaviors that maximize reproductive success Include mate choice, number of mates and parental care Evolved in response to ecology, food resources, nest sites, distribution of potential mates Mate choice first observed by Darwin fig 55.8 Female`s evaluate male`s quality, decide whether or not to mate Superior mates should leave more offspring Parental investment and mate choice Contributions of each parent to raising offspring Estimate energy spent by male and female in offspring care Parent with the greatest cost should make choice for mate Generally female, may be male Depends on cost of parental care Fundamental differences between males and females Size of gametes: egg significantly larger than sperm Nutritional value of gametes: egg more than sperm Care costly to females that gestate and lactate Some males increase cost by collecting food, defending and feeding young Males may show mate choice if they have high parental investment Example: male cricket spermatophore = 30% of body weight Females compete for males Males choose large females to produce more offspring fig 55.9 Reproductive competition and sexual selection Reproductive competition: competitive interactions over access to mates Females frequently mate with largest male May be associated with competition between other males fig 55.10 Few males in population may sire most \nof offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define \"individual\" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by \"queen substance\", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed offspring, watch for predators, defend territory Can reproduce but do not for a period of time Nest with helpers have more offspring tbl 55.1 Helpers are often fledged offspring of those they help Resembles family situation Evolution explained by inclusive fitness concept Vertebrate Alarm Calling Activity of certain individuals benefit group at expense to individual Example: meerkats fig 55.5 Individuals act as sentries for group May give alarm call when predator sighted Draws attention to itself to protect others Behavior seems contrary to own self interest Example: Belding`s ground squirrels Colonies female-based, \nmales not related to any females Females with relatives nearby more likely to sound alarm than females with no kin nearby Alarm calling favors nepotism Socioecology Vertebrate societies have characteristic organization fig 55.22 Examines influence of environment on social organization Factors include food type and predation Example: African weaver birds Forest species fig 55.23a Builds camouflaged solitary nest Monogamous mating Eat insects Savanna species fig 55.23b Nest in colonies in trees Polygynous mating Eat seeds Feeding and nesting depend on area ecology Mating form dependent on feeding and expense of being a parent Sociality in African ungulates correlate with diet HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY Theories of Animal Sociobiology and Human Applications Could readily examine human activities Exhibit kin-selected altruism and reciprocity Show extensive parental care of offspring Possess variety of mating systems Exhibit unevolutionary behaviors like adoption Two Processes Led to Adaptive Change in Human Evolution Biological evolution Primate heritage shared with chimpanzees Include kin-selected and reciprocal altruism Traits are definitely adaptive in non-human primates Cultural evolution Transfer of information needed for survival Nongenetic mode of adaptation Passed from generation to generation by tradition Includes use of tools, shelter construction, marriage practices Difficult to identify biological components of human behavior Study cross-cultural traits May have been affected by natural selection May result from genes fixed in human populations Examples: Most mammals and human species are polygamous Many cultures exhibit same greeting pattern Many biologists resist explaining human behavior in evolutionary terms Has been used in past to support racist, fascist, sexist policies Potential for abuse still exists If behaviors are \"hardwired\" negative behaviors like violence and aggression cannot easily be changed Human behavior is affected by innate and learned components Study of human behavior will continue to be provocative [Return to Chapter 55 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to

ecosystem Gain an understanding of how various nutrients are cycled through ecosystems Understand the difference between ecosystems and biological communities Learn about the factors that shape the nature of biological communities (e.g., climate and competition among organisms) Understand how the interactions among organisms within an ecosystem affect the stability of the ecosystem Gain an awareness of \nthe major types of biomes that occur throughout the world Understand how human survival depends upon the resources and benefits provided by natural ecosystems Explore how human activities can negatively affect natural ecosystems Learn how humans can reduce their impacts upon the environment This unit will be structured to meet the following key ideas, performance standards,
