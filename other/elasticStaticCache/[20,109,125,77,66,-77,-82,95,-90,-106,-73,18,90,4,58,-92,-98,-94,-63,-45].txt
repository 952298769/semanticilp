Inherited traits can be a physical trait or a behavior. Examples of physical inherited traits include hair, eye and skin color, facial features, height, dimples, length of toes and muscle structures. Examples of behavioral traits include a terrier's instinct to chase small animals or a cat puffing out its hair in response to a threat. Although inherited traits are often associated with things we can see, these traits also play an important role in how the body develops and functions. For example, inherited traits can increase risks for heart disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma and diabetes.",1.4078015089035034],["Inherited Facial Features Inherited facial features can contribute to premature aging.",1.4006667137145996],["Human Tissue Matrix Implants are collagen implants which can help you restore a more youthful appearance and enhance your looks by temporarily decreasing the appearance of facial imperfections such as wrinkles, creases, lines, acne scars and superficial scars.",1.3699054718017578],["A facial injury can leave a scar for life.",1.3694509267807007],["A facial injury can leave a scar for life.",1.3694509267807007],["A facial injury can leave a scar for life.",1.3694509267807007],["A facial injury can leave a scar for life.",1.3694509267807007],["Spots on the face can lead to unsightly facial scars.",1.3694509267807007],["The only clearly inherited form of M bius syndrome is congenital facial diplegia, which can be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder.",1.369081735610962],["(2) the acquired characteristics (stoop, scars, facial lines etc.);",1.3582053184509277],["By this, they meant to say that a characteristic, say for instance a scar, is not transmitted to the offspring.",1.3472230434417725],["Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance * * CHROMOSOMAL BASIS OF INHERITANCE Chapter 15 * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Behavior of Chromosomes Chromosome Theory of Inheritance: genes are located at specific positions on chromo-somes and chromosome behavior during meiosis accounts for inheritance patterns * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Behavior of Chromosomes Chromosome Theory of Inheritance During meiosis, chromosomes undergo: Segregation Independent assortment * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Behavior of Chromosomes Chromosome Theory of Inheritance * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Sex chromosomes - chromosomes respon-sible for determining the sex of an individual and all the characteristics that accompany gender Female = XX (homologous) Male = XY (not homologous) Sex chromosomes (female - left, male - right) * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Sex chromosome Although not homologous, short segments at either end of Y chromosomes are the only regions that are homologous with corresponding regions of X chro-mosomes Allows the X and Y regions in males to pair and behave like homologous chromosomes during meiosis * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Gonads – male and female sex organs which, through meiosis, produce haploid gametes Female = ovaries Male = testes Hyenas possess ambiguous gonads * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Gonads Anatomical signs of gender begin to appear at ap-proximately 2 months in embryo development 78 genes have been identified on Y chromosome which determines gender– SRY (sex determining region of Y) – signals testicular development * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Sex-linked genes – gene located on either sex chromosome Most on the X chromosome with distinctive patterns of inheritance (X-linked gene) Examples: Colorblindness Hemophilia Very few on Y chromosome * * CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE * Sex-linked Patterns of Inheritance Carrier – individual who is heterozygous for a given trait for a recessively inherited dis-order;
