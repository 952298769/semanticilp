endeavour to fertilise the eggs 6) The Nervous System The five sense organs are: eyes, ears, nose, tongues, skin They all contain nerves, which send messages to the brain about what's happening The brain produces a response, which it sends via other nerves to the muscles 7) The Endocrine System This system produces and discharges chemicals called hormones A number of glands around the body (endocrine system) produce these hormones Hormones control activities such as growth or sexual characteristics and also bodily functions like menstruation 8) The Skeletal System There are 206 bones in the human body and their main job is support Some bones (e.g. the skull) provide a tough barrier to protect delicate organs like the brain Muscles are attached to the bones which contract and relax
