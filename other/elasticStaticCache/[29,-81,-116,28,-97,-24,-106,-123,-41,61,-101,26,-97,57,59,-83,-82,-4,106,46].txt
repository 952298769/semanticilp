the North and South Poles of a Magnet A lesson plan on Problem Solving with Magnets Force, Motion, and Velocity are the subject of this lesson using Balloon Rockets A lesson plan that looks at how Sound Travels Through Objects Another good lesson on Magnets - Poles, Strength, and Attracted Objects This is a Special Education lesson idea on What Sinks and Floats Other / Multiple Topics: Here's an idea for hosting your own Science Circus Here's a lesson on Decoding Braille Art Connections: This idea involves creating \"Penguin light bulbs\" (best after studying about them) An Art lesson for making Playdough Christmas Ornaments This lesson on Rainbows involves students creating a Crayon Resist This idea involves using dried Leaves to make Glitter Art Computers &amp; Internet Connections: --> Language Arts Connections: --> Math Connections: A Science and Math lesson on volume (uses pumpkins) This lesson on Angles integrates Science, Social Studies, and Art This Math and Science lesson plan involves creating Favorite Flower Graphs Music Connections: --> Physical Education / Health Connections: --> Social Studies Connections: This lesson on Cacti is called Cactus Hotel Here's a four part thematic unit on Aviation : This first part is on Pilot Jobs and Vocabulary The second lesson is on Measurement, Graphing, and Creating Art for their plane This lesson involves writing a paper as a culminating activity Here is a collection of extension activity ideas This lesson on Oil Spills focuses on Writing a Letter to a Senator The unit below is on Simple Machines and includes 10 lesson ideas: The unit begins with an introduction to the Simple Machines Unit First we look back to before there were any \"Machines,\" and look at Simple Machines like Corkscrews and Screwdrivers Lesson 2 involves exploring Simple Machines in groups This part focuses on Safety Equipment needed for some Machines This is a Matching Activity with Simple Machines and their Definitions This second part of lesson 4 continues the Matching Activity above Lesson 5 discusses Assembly Lines and the making of products Levers are the subject of this part of the unit We continue with Wedges in this lesson This
