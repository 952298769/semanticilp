consciousness was the object of study in Functionalism, and how people adapt to the demands of the real world around them Human consciousness was the topic of scientific investigation in Psychology until Watson (1913) and Behaviorism According to it, psychology can and should study only observable behavior = an observable response (to a stimulus) emitted by an organism An extreme form of behaviorism was adopted by Skinner (1950) A totally different perspective was adopted by Freud (1900) (out of therapy) The aim of psychology is to understand the human unconscious = the forces that govern the human behavior that we are unaware of In 1960 there has been a revolution, that has rejected behaviorism: cognitivism It asserts that we can and should study how the human mind works even if it cannot be observed directly Psychology today Methodology Goals of the scientific enterprise: Measurement and description Understanding and prediction Application Psychologists ask questions and try to answer the questions using a scientific methodology a) they formulate a hypothesis (hypothesis = tentative statement about the relationship between circumstances and behavior) -they get ideas via observations b) Select the method and design the study c) Collect the data data are collected via systematic observation d) Analyze the data and draw conclusions e) Report the findings There are
