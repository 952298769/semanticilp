And friction force F = kN = k W cos(theta) where k is the coefficient of friction, N = W cos(theta) is normal force, and W = mg is the weight of the moving body. And there's g again, the gravity field. Clearly the bigger W is, the more friction there is for a given k. So objects moving where gravity is stronger will tend to be slowed down faster due to the stronger braking action of the friction.",1.4382737874984741],["Whereas the first-generation towers used standard friction brakes on a horizontal track section to slow down the descending cabins, the Giant Drop uses rare-earth magnets to gently slow the ride vehicle to a stop at the base of the tower.",1.4374566078186035],["Grab is the opposite of fade: when the pad friction goes up, the self-assisting nature of the brakes causes application force to go up.",1.4366450309753418]]
