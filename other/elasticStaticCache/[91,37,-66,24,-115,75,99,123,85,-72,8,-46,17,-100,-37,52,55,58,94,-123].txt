adaptation to warm temperatures typical of their habitat avoid the hot prairie sun by staying underground underground nesting makes them more susceptible to predation from coyotes, foxes, etc. females and young are able to make a rasping sound, resembling the sound of a large rattlesnake, to scare off predators Activity Period: diurnal but most active at dusk and dawn Adaptability to Human

their proximity of nesting sites to agricultural areas Carbofuran is one chemical that is detrimental to Burrowing Owls and is now illegal to use in most countries primary food source is insects (mostly grasshoppers), owls ingest grasshoppers that have been treated with insecticides biomagnification of pesticides (increasing concentrations up the food chain) affects reproduction in the owls Rules of Conservation in Different Regions migration routes are often through Central and South American countries, where there are fewer regulations regarding pesticide use and continued use of harmful pesticides Population Status: in 1995, the Burrowing Owl status was upgraded from Threatened to Endangered Management and Outlook: as a result of its Endangered Species status in 1995, it has the focus of a variety of conservation efforts Operation Burrowing Owl and other projects involving habitat preservation with landowners have been created populations monitored by Fish and Wildlife departments reintroduced into the British Columbia interior, where it was extirpated outlook would improve if larger areas of habitat were preserved and harmful pesticides were banned in all areas of their range numbers could increase if an increased tolerance to burrowing mammals develops (i.e. badgers) provides homes for the Burrowing Owl Outlook: perilous Public Attitudes: in North America, in the past decades, the Burrowing Owl was often killed because it was associated with Prairie-Dogs or Ground Squirrels many were shot by accident because they were mistaken for Ground Squirrels many
