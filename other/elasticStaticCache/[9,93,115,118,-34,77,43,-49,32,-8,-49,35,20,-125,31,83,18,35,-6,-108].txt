environmentally attractive fuel, improving processes for the fabrication of semiconductor chips for use in computers and other electronic devices, producing gasoline that burns more cleanly and efficiently, reducing environmental problems related to automobiles, developing new synthetic fibers from which more comfortable, durable, stain-resistant, and wrinkle-free fabrics can be made, developing new computer hardware and software for better controlling chemical production processes, making them safer, cleaner, and more economic, producing cheaper fertilizers and pesticides for enhancing agricultural production, studying new catalysts, perhaps for eliminating environmentally objectionable substances from chemical plant effluents or automobile exhausts, making pharmaceuticals more cheaply, perhaps using processes based on genetic engineering, recycling metals, glass, and plastic in a more cost-effective manner, producing paper products that are cheaper and require the consumption of less of our forest resources, development of new batteries, lighter in weight and higher in capacity, perhaps to power electric cars, studying new materials for use in various areas, perhaps a new material for biological implants, or a new material for use in nuclear power plants, improving the qualities of personal products such as shampoos, soaps, hair sprays, cosmetics, etc., writing new computer programs for designing and optimizing production facilities, producing basic food products such as flour, corn syrup, sugar, etc. more efficiently from our agricultural resources, studying techniques for recovering more petroleum from oil fields, producing basic chemical products used in solvents, bleaches, cleaning agents, etc. without an adverse impact on our environment,
