attributes Recognize rectangles (including squares), circles, and triangles ina variety of positions and sizes Copy a pattern made using two objects Copy a pattern made from three shapes or objetcs MEASUREMENT Use terms which describe the amount in a container: (full, not full, empty, not empty,almost empty, almost full, etc.) Compare and use terms to describe temperature(hot, cold, warm, cool), observe changes in thermometer, and describe what is happening totemperature Compare, order, and describe length/height from baseline (nearest, tallest, same, etc.) Estimate and validate relative size of one object or container to another (too thick, too thin, just right, too long, too short, just right, etc) Explore length using nonstandard units and atthe end as \"trains\" (includes equalizing lengths) Use terms to describe, compare, and order weights of hand-held objects (heavy, heavier, heaviest, light, etc.) Compare and describe weight of two objects on a primary balance (heavier, lighter, same,etc.) with nonstandard units Fill different containers with objects and count to estimate capacity;",1.7199382781982422],["Moreover, the amount of energy per unit area of the image is
