[["Animals_ interactions with nature help shape and maintain natural environments. Grasslands exist because of the close relationship between grasses and grazing animals that don_t allow other plants to flourish. Tree and flowers consistently rely on animals to distribute their pollen and seeds. Earthworms and invertebrates help break down dead remains and recycle their nutrients to enrich the soil. The predator-prey relationship between animals also helps control the animal population as animals are continually preying on other animals. Most importantly, animals influence the nutrient cycles that life depends on. Animals give essential mineral elements in their waste and they help replenish the atmosphere_s carbon dioxide by continuing to breathe, which in turn provides carbon dioxide for plants to undergo photosynthesis. As long as life continues to be a cycle of consuming and replenishing, animals_ interaction with nature is essential to all living things.",2.1773433685302734]]
