Example: vertebrates fig 12.11 Evolutionary Rationale for Sexual Reproduction Problems associated with sexual reproduction Advantage to species which benefit from genetic variability Evolution occurs because of changes at level of the individual Recombination is evolutionarily both constructive and destructive Segregation of chromosomes disrupts beneficial gene combinations \nDiverse progeny will be less well-adapted than parents Complex adaptations are less likely to benefit from recombination Trends for asexually-reproducing organisms Live in harsh habitats Premium on well-adapted, genetically uniform individuals Benefit to sexual reproduction is yet unknown Meiotic recombination among protists is often absent Sex may only occur under stressful conditions In some protists diploid is transient or only haploid phase exists With stress haploids fuse forming diploid zygote Resulting diploid may not persist Sex may have evolved in protists to repair DNA damage Particularly double-stranded breaks in DNA Breaks induced by radiation or chemicals Repair of such damage is necessary in longer-lived organisms DNA repair through mechanism of synaptonemal complex Transient diploid stage allows for such repair Special yeast mutations Repair system inactivated for double-strand breaks Crossing over also prevented THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF SEX Principal Factors in the Evolution of the Eukaryotes Reassortment of genetic material occurs during meiosis Represents an enormous factor in initiation of genetic variability In humans 23 chromosomes are from each parent Each chromosome segregates independently of all others Gamete possibilities equals 223 (over eight million) Fertilization squares the number of possibilities (70 trillion) Crossing over further adds to the variability Evolutionary Consequences of Sex Are Profound Genetic diversity is raw material of evolution Pace of evolution increased with greater genetic diversity Evolutionary Process Is Revolutionary and Conservative Revolutionary as the pace is quickened by genetic variability Conservative as variation is not always favored by selection Acts to preserve existing combinations of genes Greater in asexual organisms that are not highly mobile Live in extremely demanding habitats In vertebrates, the evolutionary premium is on versatility, thus sex [Return to Chapter 12 Page]
