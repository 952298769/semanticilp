presence of limbs, head, different organs, body cavity cellular - presence of types of cells or tissues, presence of organelles reproductive modes - lays egg, live birth molecular - presence of types of genes, sequences genes organisms are named and grouped based on defined sets of characteristics groups start small with organisms which are the only ones possessing a trait - species groups are then put together to form larger groups which have more characteristics in common - genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom - these groups are called taxa Phylogeny the evolutionary relationship among different taxa sort of a family tree early taxonomic schemes predated the concept of evolution and/or modern biochemical techniques used for comparisons this resulted in groupings of organisms which weren&#146;t correctly organized with respect to their evolutionary origins there is currently a lot of research into taxonomy and phylogeny using new molecular tools Characteristics used to construct phylogenies shared traits - synapomorphies traits which all members of a group under consideration share i.e. chordates - all have a notochord during sometime in their life cycle i.e. birds - all have feathers there are characteristics which are homologous between groups of organism homologous characteristics are those which share a common evolutionary origin limbs of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals homologous structures have very similar embryonic origins there are also similar characteristics which are not homologous structures i.e. wings in insects and wings in birds these are non-homologous structures although they perform the same function - flight since these structure perform the same task, flight, they are referred to as orthologous structures derived characteristics those characteristics which are only present in the group of animals being studied ancestral characteristics those present both in the group being studied and in other groups the idea is that ancestral characters would be those found in direct ancestors of the group under consideration a derived character for one group can be an ancestral character for another, more advanced group the arrangement of groups based on synapomorphy of derived characters is hierarchical How do we 1 st determine what characteristics should be used to then determine phylogeny traits determined by methods already described chief among these is molecular biology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology molecular biology sequences of rRNA and mitochondrial DNA comparative embryology -

flatworms pseudocoelomate - the cavity between the mesoderm and ectoderm forms from the blastocoel coelomates - the body cavity forms from inside the mesoderm, the mesoderm therefore surrounds the coelom unsegmented body - mollusca segmented body - annelids, arthropods deuterostomes - oral opening forms second after anal opening which forms near the blastopore all deuterostomes are coelomates - have a true coelom bilateral embryos, secondarily radial adults bilaterally symmetrical adults, endoskeleton Multicellularity colonial vs. true multicellular colonial multiple identical cells living communally volvox multicellularity different types of cells cells can be either arranged by types (tissues) or uniformly dispersed through out organism -

middle germ because they give rise to many different cell types later during embryogenesis interactions between these primary germ layers (cell types) give rise to all other cell types ecto + endo = meso ecto + meso = neural neural + ecto = eye/ear meso + endo = internal organs like blood vessels meso + ecto + endo = internal organs like liver, lungs etc&#133; organization of cell types is first into tissues -
