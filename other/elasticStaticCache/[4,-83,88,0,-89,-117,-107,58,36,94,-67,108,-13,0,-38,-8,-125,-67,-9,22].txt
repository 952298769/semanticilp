Macronutrients provide the bulk energy an organism's metabolic system needs to function while micronutrients provide the necessary cofactors for metabolism to be carried out. Both types of nutrients can be acquired from the environment. [1] Micronutrients are used to build and repair tissues and to regulate body processes while macronutrients are converted to, and used for, energy. Methods of nutrient intake are different for plants and animals. Plants take in nutrients directly from the soil through their roots and from the atmosphere through their leaves. Animals and protists have specialized digestive systems that work to break down macronutrients for energy and utilize micronutrients for both metabolism and anabolism (constructive synthesis) in the body.",1.3308900594711304],["Roots need to get oxygen directly from soil pores to survive.",1.2736533880233765],["Roots need to get oxygen directly from soil pores to survive.",1.2736533880233765],["Direct drilling to retain the cloddy nature of roots from a past season's weed \nand pasture growth will also provide a stable surface but skill is needed to get the right balance between a soil that is cloddy and a good seedbed.",1.1953794956207275]]
