The germination period can vary due to the temperature around the seed or the type of carnation from ten days to three weeks. Light is not a requirement for the seed to germinate, but the seed needs to absorb sunlight for its early growth stages using its two seed leaves. While the seedling continues to grow, true leaves are produced. When there is enough leaves, they can be used to help support the plant. Six or more hours of sunlight a day is needed to help keep the seedling growing. Moist soil further aids the growth of the plant. Although, if the plant has too much water and becomes soggy, it can yellow the plant. Flowering from the buds can begin as early as four to six weeks after sprouting.

Mark plants A, B and C. 2. Put cardboard pieces at the bottom of each bag. 3. Put plant A in one bag with one 250mL beaker half filled with water. Place Alka- Seltzer in water, twist close. 4. Put plant B in one bag. Put 50mL of Soda Lime in a Petri dish and place in bag with plant B, twist close. 5. Put plant C in one bag. Twist close. (This is the \"control\" plant.) 6. Find a sunny place in your classroom to place all three plants. (The plants must have same amount of sunlight and water.) The plants are to set for one day. 7. After one day, remove plants from bags.

Place beaker with alcohol into beaker with water, on to the hot plate. 11. Take leaves one at a time and put in beaker with hot alcohol. Leave in for ten minutes. 12. Remove leaf with plastic tongues. 13. Place leaf on paper towel to dry, then place in Petri dish. 14. Place several drops of potassium iodide on each leaf. 15.
