measured in calories per hour not surprisingly, larger animals require more energy to maintain their bodies than smaller ones so larger animals have a higher basal metabolic rate, and have to eat more total calories per day just to stay alive but as we look at animals with larger and larger bodies, the metabolic rate (calories per hour) rises more slowly than the body weight that is, a larger animal needs fewer calories per pound of body weight than a smaller animal so a smaller animal has to eat more relative to its body weight so smaller animals generally have to concentrate on foods with a high caloric payoff while larger animals can eat foods with a lower caloric content think of hummingbirds, eating high-sugar flower nectar all animals would be happy to subsist on such high-quality food, but there just is not enough of it around, or it is distributed in packages too small, to support a large-bodied animal while elephants eat leaves, straw, woody plant parts these require that the elephant eat them in large quantities and digest them for some time these foods have fewer calories per pound of food but are widely available, so a large animal with a lower requirement of calories per pound of body weight can find enough but a small animal could not stuff enough of these foods into its body at one time to get the calories it needed activity requires additional energy, so a typical animal might need to eat enough to provide twice its basal metabolic rate so a very active animal needs more food than one that moves slowly growing requires additional energy you all know that growing children need to eat a lot gestating (being pregnant) requires additional energy gestation increases a female's caloric needs up to 25% the additional calories required increase from almost none right after conception, to about 25% of the female's normal requirement as birth approaches lactating (producing milk) requires even more than pregnancy lactation increases a female's caloric needs about 50% she is \"eating for two\" (or really \"one and a half\") in addition to energy (calories) the diet also needs to include enough protein (amino acids), vitamins, minerals, some elements (like iron) calories are provided by carbohydrates, fats, and oils and the diet should not have too much of any chemicals that are toxic or impede digestion like most mammals, primates also need to drink water most need water at least once a day Food sources: different primates concentrate on many different foods most primates each many different foods, often 50 or more kinds but each species emphasizes certain foods more than others primates (and other animals) need two general categories of foods some foods that provide carbohydrates other foods that provide protein most prosimians get carbohydrates from gum and fruit protein from insects most anthropoids get carbohydrates from fruit protein from insects or young leaves most primates are fairly focussed on certain types of foods see chart on page 174 to get an idea of the variation in primate diets chimps eat mostly fruit, with smaller amounts of leaves, insects, very occasional meat, etc. Bushbabies (or galagos), a kind of prosimian, get 70% of their diet from insects, 20% from fruit, and 10% from gum Spider monkeys get 80% of their diet from fruit, and 20% from leaves Langurs get about 65% of their diet from leaves, 25% from fruit, and 10% from flowers etc. while one type of food usually predominates, most primates do eat a variety of foods unlike many other animals, they are not highly specialized on one particular kind of food categories of food specializations: insectivore : insect eater insectivores are usually small insects provide good quality, rapidly digestible food, but in small packages larger animals would have trouble getting enough food if they depended on insects unless they had some highly efficient method of getting a lot of them, like the long, specialized tongue of an anteater while small animals have to depend on rapidly digestible food, because of their relatively higher metabolic rate they simply can't eat enough volume of low-quality food to get the calories they need insectivores typically have high, pointy cusps on the teeth, including the molars, for breaking into the insect's tough exoskeletons short, simple digestive tract gummivore : plant gum eater gummivores are also usually small same reasons as insectivores gummivores typically have sturdy incisors, and sometimes canines, that stick forward and are shaped for gouging into bark and scraping off gum frugivore : fruit eater frugivores tend to be intermediate in size fruits have fewer calories per pound than do insects and gum, but are still much better than leaves and other plant parts fruit is typically more widely available, and in larger package sizes, than insects and gum frugivores typically have wide incisors for scraping out the meat of fruits from their rinds low, rounded molar cusps for pulverizing fruit often have large stomachs to hold the bulky leaves and other plant parts they eat along with the fruit folivore : leaf eater (\" \nfoliage\") folivores tend to be intermediate to large in size leaves offer relatively few calories per pound, but are very plentiful but an animal has to be relatively large to physically process enough leaves and must have relatively lower caloric needs per pound of body weight folivores typically have sharp, ridged molars for shearing leaves into small bits long, more specialized digestive tract for processing a lot of leaves often with a specialized section to house microorganisms that break down cellulose often with a very large stomach to hold the large volumes of leaves required to get enough calories notice that there are no primate carnivores (unless you count insects as \"meat\") some primates occasionally eat some other vertebrates, but it is not a predominant part of the diet Food distribution
