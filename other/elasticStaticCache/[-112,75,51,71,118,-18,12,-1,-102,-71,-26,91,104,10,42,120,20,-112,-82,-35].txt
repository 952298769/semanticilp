varying light quality (color) cyanobacteria-can vary the proportions of PE and PC (produce PE in green light, not in red) \nplants-LHC can associate more with PS II or more with PS I -this is regulated by the redox state of the cytochrome complex (when cyt are reduced PS II more active than PS I, LHC goes to PS I) (when cyt are oxid PS I more active, LHC goes back to PS II) association is regulated by phosphorylation of the LHC Phenomena that confused early researchers of photosynthesis: Red drop drop in quantum yield at wavelengths above 680-690 nm (quantum yield = amount of product relative to the light energy absorbed) this means that far-red light (longer than 690) is absorbed, but that energy is very inefficient at driving photosynthesis suggests two photosystems acting in

similar rate in far-red light PS rate with both red and far-red is greater than the sum of the individual rates suggests two light harvesting systems with different wavelength optima
