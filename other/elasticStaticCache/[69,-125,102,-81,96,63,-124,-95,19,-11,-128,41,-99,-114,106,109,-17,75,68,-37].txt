crystal form - the external expression of a mineral that reflects the orderly internal arrangement of constituent atoms - each mineral has a definite crystal form although it may not be observed in a hand specimen Modern methods of determining crystal form (crystal structure) : X-ray diffraction: - reflection of x-rays as they pass through a crystalline substance - this method can determine precisely a minerals internal structure or its atomic arrangement - constancy of interfacial angles:- formulated as a law by Nicolaus Steno (1638 -
