INQUIRY SKILLS Students will conduct investigations using the processes of scientific inquiry Access information from a variety of reliable sources Design and conduct observational and experimental investigations Select and use appropriate tools to collect and record data, measure data, and make observations Ask questions about phenomena, make predictions, and formulate testable hypothesis Use classification systems Use scientific vocabulary in reporting observations Organize and explain data graphically and use mathematics in scientific inquiry Analyze, interpret, and evaluate data from observations and investigations Construct representative models of phenomena Describe objects, procedures, and results orally and in writing Summarize and state conclusions of scientific investigations B. PHYSICAL SCIENCE Students will identify the properties of objects and materials Conduct investigations that demonstrate how matter can change into different states (examples: solid, liquid, and gas) Infer that objects are made of one or more materials Investigate the properties of matter that extend beyond obvious properties (examples: hardness, solubility, flexibility, and melting point) Students will explore the position and motion of objects Identify and describe the position and motion of objects relative to other objects or their backgrounds Describe the position of objects in numerical terms (examples: three meters away, twenty feet away) Investigate and graphically describe the motion of objects related to time Create a graph that describes speed as the distance traveled in a given time Students will explore characteristics of light, heat, electricity, and magnetism Design an electrical circuit to identify the conductivity of different objects Investigate electricity as it relates to light, heat, sound, and magnetism Compare materials for their ability to conduct or insulate heat Investigate ways to change pitch by varying the vibrations of objects C. LIFE SCIENCE Students will identify characteristics of organisms Compare structural parts of organisms to their functions Investigate how organisms meet their needs for survival Identify actions of animals in response to internal stimuli and the types of behaviors resulting from external stimuli Students will understand that organisms have life cycles Differentiate between learned and inherited characteristics Students will study how organisms survive in distinct environments Investigate how the behavior of plants and animals are influenced by changes in their environments Investigate how organisms cause changes in their environments Examine the beneficial and detrimental effects that accompany human alteration of the environment D. EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Students will identify the properties of Earth&#146;s materials Investigate the properties of air, rocks, and minerals Explain how humans obtain water and how water enters and leaves the atmosphere Students will describe changes in Earth and sky Observe and describe movements of the properties and locations of clouds Predict the local weather by using simple scientific tools to design and run a weather station Describe processes that create turbulent weather conditions E. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Students will investigate the use of different technologies Analyze the use of tools and inventions Recognize that specific technology, tools, and instruments assist humans to work efficiently or live more conveniently Students will demonstrate abilities in \ntechnology design Identify a simple problem in the immediate environment and propose possible solutions Establish criteria for effective solutions Explore/invent/design possible solutions to the problem using small groups or whole class Build the proposed solution and evaluate results Summarize and communicate methods and solutions F. SCIENCE IN PERSONAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES Students will practice safety Publish and use a set of safety rules when working on science projects alone or in groups Students will describe characteristics and changes in population Determine how population growth affects the quality of life among different cultures Students will identify types of resource Investigate ways to protect nonmaterial resources (examples: quiet places, security, safety) Students will describe changes in environments Investigate how basic resources are endangered by pollution Categorize types of pollution and determine which ones are most threatening to living organisms G. HISTORY AND NATURE OF SCIENCE Students will identify science as a human endeavor Recognize that science is an activity that students can do Compare science and technology of past cultures with science and technology of today Show how people from diverse cultures are engaged in scientific endeavors at varying degrees of complexity",0.9641441106796265],["Standards of Learning Covered (Grades K-8) : K.1 The student will conduct investigations in which basic properties of objects are identified by direct observation;",0.9617847800254822],["Standards of Learning Covered (Grades K-8) : K.1 The student will conduct investigations in which basic properties of objects are identified by direct observation;",0.9617847800254822],["Standards of Learning Covered (Grades K-8) : K.1 The student will conduct investigations in which basic properties of objects are identified by direct observation;",0.9617847800254822],["Science Scientific Investigation, Reasoning, and Logic K.1 The student will conduct investigations in which basic properties of objects are identified by direct observation;",0.9617847800254822],["Standards of Learning Covered (Grades K-8) : K.1 The student will conduct investigations in which basic properties of objects are identified by direct observation;",0.9617847800254822],["When searches are conducted without individual suspicion, or student bags or belongings are searched prior to the detection of metal or suspicious objects, the Fourth Amendment may be implicated.",0.9531752467155457]]
