a place that she never dreamed existed and after a while she was truly glad For I reached out to her like none had done in her need for tenderness and caring that night Unable to hold her I tried to give her comfort through my words to bring her back into the light She was searching for someone that she could share a moment with to ease the pain in her heart I felt it from the beginning and started to send her some of my poetry to help her from the start As she read these poems with their beauty, love and pain that had been written by me over time She was amazed that she felt the same way as some that she felt were hers not mine For she soon realized that I had pain in my life like she was suffering so deep in her heart that day But she realized that by sharing them with her I was blessing her with the love that they convey So in her amazement she found that by reading these simple words that were so near to her heart For moments in time she was lifted out of her pain and she had found a new friend for a start This man she had just met had given her a little bit of his love from his heart by sharing this gift She understood instinctively that he had a heart that was large and of his love it was filled with it She had made a new friend that she met that lonely night in November as the Autumn leaves fell He had just for a moment taken her out of her pain and she knew that it was not truly Hell Then wonder of wonders when she came back and was sitting there all alone in the dark This new friend came back and she found that he had his love taken away from his heart His life was shattered and he had no place to turn as he cried looking sadly at the screen She offered him her compassion, gave him hope and for a little while he did not feel like a scream This lady with the name of a precious gem turned the light that he had given her back to him Wanting to help him like she had helped her in the loneliness that they shared time and again So she offered a caring moment to this lonely man sitting there with his heart broken in two Glad to return that which he had given her such a short time before trying to make him whole too So these two shared their pain and became friends in the cool of an Autumn night Knowing that both of them shared the sad fortunes of lost love is such a fright Because each of them had a love that had gone away from them and they knew not what to do But by sharing for a moment they found that each was able to give the other some love too These two who it seems were met by chance or will it come to something yet to be seen The fates are strange to such as these two and he wonders what their friendship will come to mean The Jade Lady is a study of beautiful as it depicted by her name for she is a beautiful gem When he saw her face it amazed him of the beauty there both outside and within This lady with a name that matches her beauty and grace by the smile that she has on her face Took this lonely man out of his torment for a while and put him in a happier place She with the eyes that seem to come from the dreams of Aladdin of his fair princess of the east Him with the blood of his native American ancestors that goes through his veins like bread's yeast She has the blood of a thousand fair maidens behind her that have inspired men to mighty deeds He has the blood of a warrior that has ridden over the plains with the greatest of ease They joined together for a moment in time in the fairy land of imagination that they met on Knowing that soon enough that their time would be over and they must leave and be gone Each knowing that they had found someone who struck a cord in their life for a moment in time They know that they will seek each other out again because of this friendship, yours and mine So this Jade beauty that met a stranger one night and found a new friend to help her ease her pain Knows that because of this friendship she shall find him time and time again The warrior who has met this beauty of the east with her flashing eyes like a dream from the past Will also seek her out because she helped him in his moment of despair so that he would last He is in his travels to the far east has seen many pieces of Jade that were beautiful in his eyes But none as beautiful as this maiden who came to him when she felt and heard his cries Jade has been called cold but this is not true for this maiden who has such warmth in her heart He felt it from the first and is glad he took the time to share poems with her some from the start So this Jade lady will find that she has made a friend that she can search for to share He will be able to look for her and perhaps give her a little bit of warmth and care These new friends both realize that friendship can \nbe wonderful and grand He reaches across time and space and offers her the warmth of his hand They shall grow to learn more of each other and their shall be moments of pain in their life He knows that he shall be able to come to her in his pain and when he is feeling great strife Jade Lady I thank you for being their to help me in my loneliness that fateful night I hope that I shall carry your friendship down through the years at

But he's never saw the light He got hand me down, hand me down Hand me down religion He said the church has no business Tampering with a man's soul Cause he swears their ain't no devil Down in no big black hole If the devil doesn't exist If he's a creation of man Then man created the devil In his own image with his own hands Had a cigar in his mouth But he said he didn't smoke Had shoes on his

mouth Played his nose like harmonica Hair in need of an oil change Smoked ox blood through chicken bones Used god's name in vain Chorus birds nest portland hair He knew she was trailer park trash Barley sky gave him a Pumpernickel rash Chorus Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Heard the sound of rain Dripping from a tin roof into a can of lard Like a tad pole on a dry rivers bed Took a swim to the nearest star I would be president but I'm not without sin You rode the bus while I jumped the fence Take a Tooth (Give an Eye) Lived in a shotgun house Close to the tracks Spray painted your name On the over pass Is there grace without gravity faith for the blind The barns are raising the devils killing time I was a writer before I could speak And I spoke before I could think I've stopped to hear a still small voice Giving me freedom Giving me a choice Between the devil and the deep blue sea With jaundiced eyes on the road to perdition Always kept his powder dry All is fair in love and war Pursuing the apple of his eye Between you, me and the lamppost She was dressed to the nines But she tired men with her idle chit chat Not one word worth a cold thin dime Between the devil and the deep blue sea Every cloud has a silver lining Every ocean has a green eyed monster Dyed in the wool and still shinning Feet of clay and a pair of purple valentines Gave him the slip on weaver's run She's running with the hair hunting with the hounds With a slender reed the cat's on the prowl She became penny wise and pound foolish Couldn't make a silk purse out of a sows ear Living in clover squeezing blood from a turnip In a blue funk crying crocodile tears Left no stone unturned smart as a whip More than one way to skin a cat Spit and polish spic and span Bull in the china shop is wearing a brass hat He bought her love for a song She couldn't see the forest for the tree's Half a loaf is better than none Bought a pig in a poke with a head full of steam Action speaks louder than words Cut off her nose with a fish hook to spit her face Heaping coals of fire upon her head She's a millstone around his neck She threw the baby out with the bath water And put bats in the belfry Hell is paved with good intentions And a month of sunday's Don't you judge the preacher Don't call me good, there's only one that's good Jesus came to save sinners of which I am the worst (Drums kick in) Don't you judge the preacher The preacher he is judge God called preaching folly So don't you hold a grudge If you don't have the faith You can't understand it If you have the faith Nothing left to explain I have died to sin Used to walk in these ways Truth are in the headlines At the bottom of a bird cage Had my oxen in a ditch Jesus wept Sunday's turning black The rocks cry out Road Less Traveled The snow fell like butterflies The air was bitter cold I crossed the sugar tree field Warmed my bones in a worm hole Fire by night cloud by day I don't regret one minute along the way When the evening sun Starts sinking low I count my many blessings upon the road Many lay by the way side Cuz the journey is long Lost in their aching heart is desire to move on Road less traveled Jesus lead me home Good morning mule skinner I'm going to move on Mocking bird be singing That I'm not alone When I enter that city paved with gold Pearly gates going to \nopen take me to my home Sky opened up Latter rain began to fall Ushering in the crops As the willows are tall Down by the waters course Remember from where I came Dip my hat in the pool I must be on my way The Last Song Make the Mississippi run backwards Flood waters are going to crest Going to flood the old devil Can't give him no rest The devil going to be running Like a Jack Rabbit out of New Orleans High tail'n it up north That's where he outta be Got to resist his temptations Stomp him under your feet Sun is going to shine on the cotton fields The day that ol' serpent leaves Don't drink from the devils troft He's the father of lies Leaving a trail on the river banks Swore I seen mud in his eye Greater is He that is in me Than he that is in the world Who'll bell the cat A boon companion Promised a chicken in every pot Feast or famine deep six or starve Burning the candle at both ends Crossed the rubicon Nervous tic pulled at the corner of his mouth Jumping like a big mouth bass down south Chorus Light at the end of the tunnel Became a runaway train Wearing jack boots like a gestapo When it pours it rains Fall on stony ground trampled under foot The fats in the fire cats on a hot tin roof Chorus Down at the beauty parlor They gave her a permanent fit Her hair looks like something You'd pound meat with Her hub cap eyes looked at him like a t-bone Like a wild horse stampede But he had loosed his demons And his spirit been set free One Man's Opinion Lost in the Canopy of tree's he never had horse sense Oaks and Pines cap off the skies he wandered through the circus tent Before the eyes of God tried squeezing through a needles eye The world is a small place every face tells a lie He drank a gallon of embalming fluid which kept him in the stir When your full of Helium best keep your shoes on and your thoughts pure Forest is a poachers paridise and the squirrels jumping from the tree's Nose as red as a tomato livers spotted with disease The way he plays the game it's never a game of chance Took him

always ready to run him out on the rail But the checker players like the tales he tells They seem to want bad news and they always want more He said he'll sleep it off and in the morning shove it

Birmingham Concert in the Park recorded live 8-22-96 Ain't no Devil The fellow was familiar with Bulldogs and Water hoses With coat hanger shoulders and a silver spoon in his mouth With a pocket of fools gold Ingenuity and elbow grease He got a $50 Erie Root Canal Killed the pain with a bottle dipped from the Hudson Gave his liver an eviction note With corn rolls on his head like a big black widow He rode the stick horse derby mounted on a goat Readers Digest and a T.V. guide is all the bible he ever read Captain Marvel and Wonder Women the mom and dad he never had On a dark Kentucky night about to take a bullet in the back He saw Jesus standing there by the caution sign Ain't no devil in the fiery furnace in the burning bush In the lions den pushing this pen Going to raise the dead sleeping in my bed Going to open blind eyes can satisfy At the pearly gates walking on the lake On the mountain top going to steal and rob By the river side going to baptize Going to dry those eyes ain't no devil going to crash them skies It all came crashing down timber tumbled to the ground With a tobacco tan he climbed thin air Life's too short to box with God promised he would not spare

But she wants too much of my time When i'm tempted by her hair Chorus I love Jesus more than I love you Cause he ain't done me no wrong I got a girl she's first class But sometimes she goes too fast When i'm tempted by the speed If I plant a tree If I plant a tree today I may never sit under its shade But I look at the dirt on my hands And I wonder why God made man I hold my sons in my arms Could I send them away to war I see the trust in their eyes And I wander if God cries I look up at the stars And I wonder where you are Are you looking back down at me Your as far as the eye can see It must

and I passed through You're a bluebird on a telegraph line I hope you're happy now Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl You'll make it back somehow Candle In The Wind Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your \nbrain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would have liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude Goodbye Norma Jean From the young man in the 22nd row Who sees you as something as more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe Bennie And The Jets Hey kids, shake it loose together The spotlight's hitting something That's been known to change the weather We'll kill the fatted calf tonight So stick around You're gonna hear electric music Solid walls of sound Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful Oh Bennie she's really keen She's got electric boots a mohair suit You know I read it in a magazine Bennie and the Jets Hey kids, plug into the faithless Maybe they're blinded But Bennie makes them ageless We shall survive, let us take ourselves along Where we fight our parents out in the streets To find who's right and who's wrong Goodbye Yellow Brick Road When are you gonna come down When are you going to land I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods Hunting the horny back toad Oh I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do then I bet that'll shoot down your plane It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics To set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacement There's plenty like me to be found Mongrels who ain't got a penny Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground This Song Has No Title Tune me in to the wild side of life I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife Take me to the garretts where the artists have died Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines Look in the mirror and stare at myself And wonder if that's really me on the shelf And each day I learn just a little bit more I don't know why but I do know what for If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune Take me down alleys where the murders are done In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun Want to read books in the studies of men Born on the breeze and die on the wind If I was an artist who paints with his eyes I'd study my subject and silently cry Cry for my darkness to come down on me For confusion to carry on turning the wheel Grey Seal Why's it never light on my lawn Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born On the big screen they showed us the sun But not as bright in life as the real one It's never quite the same as the real one And tell me grey seal How does it feel To be so wise To see through eyes That only see what's real Tell me grey seal I never learned why meteors were formed I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn If anyone can cry then so can I I read books and draw life from the eye All my life is drawings from the eye Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men The roots were formed by twisted roots Your roots were twisted then I was re-born before all life could die The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I Jamaica Jerk Off When she gets up in the morning It's enough to wake the dead Oh she turning on the radio And dancing on my head It's no good living in the sun Playing guitar all day Boogalooing with my friends In that erotic way Come on Jamaica In Jamaica all day Dancing with your darling Do Jamaica jerk-off that way Come on Jamaica Everybody say We're all happy in Jamaica Do Jamaica Jerk-off that way Let the ladies and the gentlemen Be as rude as they like On the beaches, oh in the jungle Where the people feel alright So do it Jamaica Got plenty for you and me Honky tonking with my baby In that deep blue sea I've Seen That Movie Too I can see by your eyes you must be lying When you think I don't have a clue Baby you're crazy If you think that you can fool me Because I've seen that movie too The one where the players are acting surprised Saying love' \ns just a four letter word Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes Well their actions become so absurd So keep your auditions for somebody Who hasn't got so much to lose 'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting That I've seen that movie too It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around Stop twinkling your star like you do I'm not the blue print for all of your B films Because I've seen that movie too Sweet Painted Lady I'm back on dry land once again Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain We're all hunting honey with money to burn Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned If the boys all behave themselves here Well there's pretty young ladied and beer in the rear You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright So she lays down beside me again My sweet painted lady, the one with no name Many have used her and many still do There's a place in the world for a woman like you Oh sweet painted lady Seems it's always been the same Getting paid for being laid Guess that's the name of the game Forget us we'll have gone very soon Just forget we ever slept in your rooms And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds Where love's just a job and nothing is said The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) Some punk with a shotgun Killed young Danny Bailey In cold blood, in the lobby Of a downtown motel Killed him in anger A force he couldn't handle Helped pull the trigger That cut short his life And there's not many knew him The way that we did Sure enough he was a wild one But then aren't most hungry kids Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in Dillinger's dead I guess the cops won again Now it's all over Danny Bailey And the harvest is in We're running short of heroes Back up here in the hills Without Danny Bailey We're gonna have to break up our stills So mark his grave well 'Cause Kentucky loved him Born and raised a proper I guess life just bugged him And he found faith in danger A lifestyle he lived by A running gun younster In a sad restless age Dirty Little Girl I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard When I watch the police come by and move you on Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl Someone grab that bitch by the ears Rub her down scrub her back And turn her inside out 'Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped All The Girls Love Alice Raised to be a lady by the golden rule Alice was the spawn of a public school With a double barrel name in the back of her brain And a simple case of Mummy doesn't love me\" blues Reality it seems was just a dream
