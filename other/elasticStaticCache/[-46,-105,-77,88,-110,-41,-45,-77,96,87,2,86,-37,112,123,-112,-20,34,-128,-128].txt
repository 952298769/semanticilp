[["These kinds of barriers often have important effects on the environment, so that the groups of populations experience different selection pressures e.g., a mountain chain creates a rainshadow the populations on the \"shadow\" side will experience drier conditions, which will influence not only them, but the other plants and animals in their communities that, in turn, will cause selection for a whole variety of different traits than those that will be favored on the wetter side of the mountain chain Over time, selection will cause the groups of populations to become increasingly different If the barrier persists long enough, and if sufficient change occurs in the two groups, they will no longer be able to interbreed even if populations come into contact - we say they are reproductively isolated , and they belong to two species instead of one Reproductive isolating mechanisms can take several forms - the forms can be divided according to whether they act to prevent mating and fertilization, or whether they act after fertilization has taken place: Pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms prevent mating/fertilization - they include: ecological isolation : populations occur in the same general area, but occupy different habitats, so individuals don't encounter each other to breed temporal isolation : populations occur in the same habitat, but are active at different times (e.g., one is nocturnal, one is diurnal), so individuals don't encounter each other to breed behavioral isolation : members of different species use different behaviors to identify themselves - so even if individuals encounter one another, they don't \"recognize\" each other as potential mates mechanical isolation : structural differences in genitalia or flower structure prevent males of one species from mating with/fertilizing females of another gametic isolation : even if mating takes place, sperm and egg are incompatible and fertilization doesn't take place Post-zygotic isolation : the development of fertile, viable adults is prevented because of genetic incompatibility hybrid inviability : hybrid zygotes don't develop or don't reach sexual maturity hybrid sterility : hybrids fail to produce gametes (e.g., mules) hybrid breakdown : first-generation hybrids are viable and fertile, but their offspring are not A special case of geographic speciation is adaptive radiation adaptive radiation is the very rapid diversification of new species from a single ancestor adaptive radiations typically occur when one of two things happens: a founder population colonizes a new habitat with abundant resources and no competitors - e.g., a new island as members of the population begin to exploit different sets of resources, they experience different selection pressures and diverge e.g., Darwin's finches on the Galapagos;",1.484089970588684],["cross-fertilization Fertilization by the joining of gametes from different individuals of the same species ( cross-pollination ), or from different species ( hybridization ).",1.2007319927215576],["(Dawson, 65) Because the gestation period is nearly the same length as oestrus, mating and fertilization occur in some species merely a day or two after birth.",1.1394872665405273]]
