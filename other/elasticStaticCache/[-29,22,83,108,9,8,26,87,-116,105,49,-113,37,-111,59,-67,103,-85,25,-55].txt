The thick, woolly fur helps insulate the fox against the cold, desert nights (2). The fennec fox starts to tremble with cold when temperatures drop below 20 degrees Celsius, but incredibly, they only start to pant when temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius. When they do pant, their breathing rate rockets from 23 breaths per minute up to an astonishing 690 breaths per minute (4). Fennec foxes are monogamous, and the pair lives with their offspring in a family unit of up to ten individuals (2). Fennec foxes mate in January and February and females give birth in March and April (5). Usually a litter of two to five cubs are born every year, after a gestation period of around 50 days. The male provides food and defends the burrow (which can be up to ten meters in length) until the cubs are four weeks old. They are weaned at 61 to 70 days and reach adult size and sexual maturity after only 9 to 11 months (2). In captivity, the fennec fox has been known to live for almost 13 years (2). Fennec foxes feed primarily on grasshoppers and locusts, but also eat other insects, rodents, birds, lizards and roots. They hunt alone and locate prey primarily by sound, killing their target with a bite to the neck (2).",1.1850649118423462],["The _ shape of a bird's beak, the number of fingers, color of the fur, _ the thickness or thinness of the fur, the shape of the nose or ears _ are all examples of physical adaptations which help different _ animals to survive.",1.1738499402999878],["The shape of a bird's beak, the number of fingers, color of the fur, the thickness or thinness of the fur, the shape of the nose or ears are all examples of physical adaptations which help different animals survive.",1.1738499402999878],["The shape of a bird's beak, the number of fingers, color of the fur, the thickness or thinness of the fur, the shape of the nose or ears are all examples of physical adaptations which help different animals survive.",1.1738499402999878],["Polar Bears fur is thick (approximately 152 mm (6 in)) and is not white but translucent and hollow like optic fibers, the fur helps to transfer the heat of the sun to the skin which is black.",1.1738499402999878],["Polar bears fur is thick (approximately 152 mm (6 in)) and is not white but clear and hollow like optic fibers, the fur help to transfer the heat of the sun to the skin which is black.",1.1738499402999878],["Their hair thickens and their fur grows white.
