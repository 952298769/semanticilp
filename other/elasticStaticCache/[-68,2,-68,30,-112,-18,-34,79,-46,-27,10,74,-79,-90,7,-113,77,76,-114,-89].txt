we now know it's because of mutation and the shuffling of genes that occurs during sexual reproduction (crossing over, random assortment) observation 2: variation is heritable although some variation is due to differences in environment, many of the differences among individuals are due to genetic differences because genes are passed from parent to offspring, offspring resemble parents \nobservation 3: all organisms face a \"struggle for existence\" , which takes several forms overproduction : more individuals are born in every generation than the environment can support this means that most individuals die before they manage to reproduce the consequence of this is competition among individuals of the same species for access to the resources necessary to survive and reproduce interactions with other species : most organisms are subject to one or more of the \"3 p's\": predation, parasitism, pathogens also, different species may compete for access to similar resources interactions with the abiotic environment Darwin was very explicit in explaining that the \"struggle for existence\" could also be a metaphorical struggle, as, e.g., a plant \"struggling\" against dry soils observation #4: fitness varies among individuals note definition: fitness = relative ability to survive and reproduce no two organisms are exactly alike because of their underlying genetic differences, some individuals will be better able to survive the \"struggle for existence\" than others e.g., one seed may germinate a bit earlier, gaining access to light, space, water, soil nutrients before others of the same species e.g., one mouse might have slightly better hearing, making it better able to avoid predators e.g., one insect's immune system may make it slightly more resistant to a disease or parasite than another, allowing it to live longer e.g., one fish may be able to tolerate slightly more acidic water, allowing it to live in an environment with no competitors conclusion : what will inevitably occur if a-d are true (and they are for the vast majority of populations) is that adaptive traits will become more frequent in the population over time the organisms with the adaptive traits are surviving and reproducing better than others in the population because their adaptive traits are heritable, those traits will be passed on to their offspring because they have more offspring than others, their traits will be more frequent in subsequent generations as long as the environment stays the same, the same traits will continue to be favored, and will become increasingly common Another way to think about natural selection: see schematic at end of notes Note that there's nothing \"magic\" about selection: as long as the first four conditions are met, selection will happen Example of natural selection: the evolution of DDT resistance in mosquitoes prior to the development of DDT, some mosquitoes had an allele of a gene that could break down DDT and render it harmless - the allele was just a random mutation of a gene for an enzyme mosquitoes with that allele also had somewhat lower reproductive rates because there was no DDT in the enviroment, these mosquitoes got no advantage from the mutation consequently, they were selected against and the allele was maintained at only very low frequency in the environment When DDT was introduced into the environment, the individuals with that allele were selectively favored they survived and reproduced at a much higher rate than the mosquitoes without the allele they left more offspring - and those offspring inherited the allele the result was the increase in the frequency of the DDT-resistant allele (or, put another way, the \"spread\" of the allele throughout the population) Note a couple of important points about this example: the allele in question was already present in the population - the addition of DDT didn't cause the allele to arise this illustrates the general point that selection acts only on pre-existing variation - it does not create adaptive variation note that the allele itself isn't \"perfect\" - natural selection doesn't \"create perfect adaptation\", it simply selects the best alleles available in a given place at a given time the allele in question was actually selected against in one set of environmental circumstances, but favored in another because all environments change over time, traits that may have been disadvantageous at one time may become favored at another, and vice-versa selection never \"ends\" [ top ] [ Lectures ] [ 109N Home ] [ Dr.",0.7095564007759094],["They are \"nocturnal creatures,\" with \"night vision characteristics, well-developed smell and hearing.",0.6941866874694824],["Like most catfish, they are primarily nocturnal and have sharp spines on their dorsal fins.",0.6924217939376831],["adaptation -
