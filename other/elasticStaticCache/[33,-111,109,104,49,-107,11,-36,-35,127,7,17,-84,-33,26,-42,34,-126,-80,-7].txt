RIPE Fruits of the juicy kind (e.g. apples, tomatoes, cherries, etc.) are green and bad tasting before they ripen Such fruits are not produced for the use of people Plants develop fruits as a means of assuring dispersal of the seeds by animals seeds from ingested fruits may be spat out seeds from ingested fruits may pass through the digestive tract and \nvoided with the feces Facts about fruits: when fruits are green, the seeds have not yet reached maturity when fruits have ripened, the seeds have matured and are ready to be dispersed as fruits ripen, many kinds change color from green (leaf-like color) to a different color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) as fruits ripen, many change from bad-tasting to sweet and good-tasting as fruits ripen, many become easier to pick (i.e. to separate from the parent plant) D] SUCCULENCE Environmental factors that influence desert organisms - extreme dryness, heat, high levels of sunlight, &amp; wind these speed up water loss from the bodies of organisms Adaptations of desert plants they have a coating of wax (a cuticle) that seals in water some drop their leaves during the driest season, thus reducing their leaf surface area and their area for evaporation some (annuals) survive the driest seasons as seeds some are thick and fleshy Thick and fleshy plants are called succulents examples include cacti cacti are native only in the New World in other parts of the world their are desert plants that look like cacti, but are not cacti surface area / volume ratios of a cactus pad vs. ordinary leaf (lower for succulents) plants lose water through their surface E] ARMATURE Many desert plants are armed with an array of spines, thorns, &amp; prickles - armature plants of deserts &amp; other dry regions possess more armature than plants anywhere else Facts about desert plants many desert animals are herbivorous the amount of biomass produced by desert plants is vastly less than that produced by plants in other kinds of areas dividing the biomass by the number of animals that are seeking it for food will reveal that there is tremendous grazing pressure on available biomass Armature is a good defense only against large herbivores , it is not a good defense against small herbivores, such as insects F] WHY DO BROAD LEAVED TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES Broad-leaved trees are those whose leaves are flat and thin Facts about photosynthesis &amp; broad-leaved plants: leaves are the major photosynthetic organs of most plants photosynthesis in broad leaves does not take place when the temperature falls below about 40o F. when the soil is frozen or very cold, the absorption of water by the plant s root is slowed down or even halted (water is required for photosynthesis) broad leaves are injured when the temperature falls below freezing broad leaves can lose a lot of water to the environment Another major reason to lose leaves - stop damage due to weight of snow on branches G] GAS EXCHANGE Plants take up carbon dioxide and give off oxygen Water, as a gas, can also be exchanged (taken up or given off) For most land plants water is lost and must constantly be replenished by water from the soil.",1.7074415683746338],["A fruit protects the seeds and aids in their dispersal by wind or animals.",1.68876314163208],["Seed dispersal by birds and animals that eat the fruits.",1.6756126880645752],["Seed dispersal by birds and animals that eat the fruit.",1.6756126880645752],["Dispersal of seeds or fruits by wind.",1.656064510345459],["The fruit is a follicle and when dry, seed dispersal is by wind.",1.5877764225006104],["animal dispersal of seeds/fruits;",1.5844296216964722],["fleshy fruits attract animal dispersal agents winged and \"fluffy\" fruits for wind dispersal hooks for animal dispersal exploding fruits Pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms often result from coevolution.",1.5367344617843628],["Dispersal hooks and spines, float (coconuts), parachutes Seeds may be dispersed when animals eat the fruits.",1.5045480728149414],["Other than being dispersed by animals eating their fruits, plants also disperse seeds using wind, water, or animals in other ways.",1.484984278678894],["Pollination and seed dispersal occur by wind when the fruits split open in summer and release plume-laden seeds into the air.",1.4572395086288452],["Because of their fruit-eating, transient ways, lemurs are important agents of seed dispersal through their droppings.",1.4244675636291504],["The advantages of seed dispersal may have led to the evolution of fleshy fruits, which entice animals to eat the fruits and move the plants seeds from place to place.",1.417772889137268],["Dispersal by Animals The seeds of many fruits can be passed through the ___ ___ of animals unharmed by the process.",1.412558913230896],["Their seeds are enclosed in a fruit for easy dispersal by wind, water, or animals.",1.4073024988174438],["Dry fruits are characteristic of seeds dispersed by the wind and other natural agents or animals.",1.4073024988174438],["The chief agents in seed and fruit dispersal are wind, water and animals.",1.4073024988174438],["Flowering plants produce fruits or seeds that are dispersed by such agents as wind, water, or animals.",1.4073024988174438],["Flying foxes carry out seed dispersal by one of three methods: 1)carrying the fruit away and dropping it accidentally, 2)carrying it away, eating the flesh and discarding the seeds, and 3)consuming the fruit and seeds but passing the seeds through the gut.",1.402301549911499],["Seed dispersal is accomplished by animals that eat the fruits, and the plants can form wide, dense stands via their spreading root systems.",1.3927041292190552],["They are dispersed by wind or animals that may eat the fungal fruiting body.",1.387309193611145],["mechanisms of dispersal of fruits and seeds by animals;",1.3863760232925415],["On maturing, the fruit splits apart, releasing the seeds, which are then dispersed by wind or rain.",1.3857823610305786],["The fruit is contained in a dehiscent capsule that releases many seeds that are then dispersed by wind or water.",1.3857823610305786],["The fruit is contained in a dehiscent capsule that releases many seeds that are then dispersed by wind or water.",1.3857823610305786],["How are seeds dispersed Eaten by animals and passed through digestive system (cherries, sunflowers) (animal express) Scattered by squirrels (acorns) Attached to animals or clothing (burdock) (hitch hiker) Carried by wind (dandelion, cattails, milkweed) (traveling) Dropped or flung from the plant or tree (maple, touch-me-nots, spurge) (traveling & spring loaders) Floated by water (coconut) Go on seed hunt in the woods How are seeds used Review pollination, parts of a seed and germination Bring in many types of edible seeds (corn, peas, nuts, grains, rice) and seed products Make bird feeder using rice cakes ( \nwhich are seeds) and peanut butter (which is made from seeds).",1.370185375213623],["Success of the Angiosperms 3 main factors: Endosperm Flowers Fruits Dispersal of seeds, fruits: Wind: winged seeds (samaras) seeds with plumes --dandelions By Animals: fruits eaten, pericarp digested, seed deposited at distance from parent plant --&gt;
