magnetic dipole must compete with the random thermal motion of the dipole &#149;Compare this with the maximum dipole energy of U B = 2 B which is normally much smaller &#149;So it is expected that \nthe magnetization M should increase linearly as the external B field is increased until the dipoles are mostly aligned &#149;This deduction was proven experimentally by Pierre Curie in 1895 and is called Curie's Law where C is a constant for each material Ferromagnetism &#149;Ferromagnetism is a much stronger effect than para- or dia-magnetism &#149;The permeabilities for ferromagnetic materials are hundreds to thousands of times greater than o &#149;Ferromagnetism is a result of the combining in the same direction of the many parallel spin electrons in iron, nickel, or cobalt &#149;The effect (called exchange coupling) extends beyond any single atom and links thousands to millions of ferromagnetic atoms &#149;If the temperature is raised above several hundred &#176;C, the exchange coupling effect is overwhelmed and the atoms cease to couple in domains &#149;Under these conditions, ferromagnetism ceases to operate and the material becomes weakly paramagnetic &#149;Normally, however, those atoms will have a commonly oriented magnetic moment in a region called a magnetic domain &#149;Any piece of ferromagnetic material will normally consist of thousands of microscopic domains that are randomly oriented with respect to each other &#149;When a magnetic field is applied, some of the domains will shift their dipole alignments toward that of the external field &#149;As the field is strengthened, more of the domains will be realigned and the resulting magnetization will be much more intense than in non-ferromagnetic materials &#149;Even when the external field is removed, some of the domains will remain at the alignment they held, creating a permanent magnetic moment, i.e. a permanent magnet &#149;Lodestone is created when lightning strikes a surface deposit of iron ore and the high currents involved create a strong, though temporary, magnetic field &#149;Once a ferromagnetic material is magnetized, it is difficult to remove the magnetization &#149;Even if the external field is reversed in direction, some of the original magnetization will persist &#149;This effect is called hysteresis and makes it difficult to demagnetize any ferromagnetic material &#149;The usual way demagntization is done is to place the material in a magetic field that reverses itself many times a second and then to slowly withdraw the material from the field Induced Magnetic Fields &#149;Faraday's Law of Induction can be written: &#149;James Clerk Maxwell reasoned that, if a varying magnetic field creates an electrical field, might not a varying electric field create a magnetic field &#149;It turns out this conjecture is correct, a changing electric field between the plates of a capacitor does create a magnetic field &#149;This is one of Maxwell's contributions to electromagnetic theory &#149;This is generalized to include the more typical sources of magnetic field, static currents &#149;This is called the Ampere-Maxwell Law Displacement Current &#149;Since magnetic fields are generally created by currents, it is natural to think of Maxwell's contribution as a current &#149;This is a fictitious current called the displacement current (for historical current) &#149;It is easy to show that the displacement current arises naturally from the changing polarization of a charging capacitor &#149;The charge on the plates is &#149;Thus i d = i , the capacitor charging current &#149;And, using the Ampere-Maxwell Law, the B field for the capacitor will be Maxwell's Equations &#149;Our study of electromagnetics is now complete &#149;We have looked at electrostatics, magnetics, magnetic induction, and displacement current &#149;Each of these is summarized in an equation &#149;Collectively, these 4 equations are
