Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Ecosystems Are the Most Complex Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living Some form symbiotic relationships with plants Fix enough nitrogen to be of significance Plants can grow in soils with low amounts of nitrogen Bacteria and fungi rapidly decompose nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively insoluble and contained in only certain kinds of rocks Weather out of rocks, transported to oceans Brought up by natural uplift of land masses or by marine animals Form rich natural deposits of guano from sea birds Millions of tons of phosphates added to farm land each year Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is called superphosphate Made by treating

area to crops Experimental felling of trees and shrubs in one of six watersheds Amount of water runoff increased by 40% Amount of nutrients lost was greatly increased Conclusion: fertility lost, danger of flooding increased THE FLOW OF ENERGY Ecosystems Contain Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Autotrophs capture light energy and manufacture own food Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs Energy captured is slowly released through metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs, sugarcane fields = 3600 to 9100 grams/year Intertidal zone = 14,600 grams/year Trophic Levels Green plants convert 1% of the sun`s energy Less energy converted by the animals that eat plants Levels of consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids cannot be inverted ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION Succession: Ecosystems Have a Tendency to Change from Simple to Complex Cleared land becomes occupied by larger and more diverse plants Small pond becomes filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of autotrophs Organisms at later stages are more specialized than earlier organisms [Return to Chapter 26 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools

in the tropics Enormous diversity fig 41.24,25 External features fig 41.6 Primarily terrestrial organisms, small in size Have three body segments: head, thorax, abdomen Have three pairs of legs, all attached to thorax Have one pair of \nantennae May have one or two pairs of wings Most possess compound eyes, many have ocelli Elaborate mouthparts, widely variable fig 41.26 Characterized by unsegmented mandibles Segmented maxillae comprise secondary pair of mouth parts Labium forms the lower lip Labrum forms the upper lip Chewing insects have a tonguelike hypopharynx Orders classified by structure of mouthparts, feeding habits Chewing or mandibulate mouthparts fig 41.26 Coleoptera = beetles Hymenoptera = bees, wasps and ants Isoptera = termites Orthoptera = grasshoppers and crickets Elongate, stylet-like mouthparts Diptera = horseflies, blackflies, mosquitos have fused stylets fig 41.27a Advanced flies have piercing or lobe-like labium fig 41.27c Lepidoptera = moths, butterflies have coiled proboscis Thorax consists of three fused segments (tagmata) Each has a pair of legs Legs may be absent in some larvae Example: bees fig 34.9 Example: flies fig 41.28,30 Structure of insect wings If two pairs, attach to middle and posterior segments If one pair, attach to middle segment Arise as saclike outgrowths, are solid excluding veins Are not homologous to other appendages Two pairs are the basic construction for winged insects fig 41.25a One pair lost in the evolution of groups like flies fig 41.25b Most wings folded at rest, except for outstretched dragonfly wings Forewings may be hard and tough, form covering for hindwings Example: beetles fig 41.25d Example: grasshoppers and crickets fig 41.6,24c May possess detachable scales, like butterflies and moths fig 41.29 Some groups like springtails never evolved wings Other insects are derived from winged ancestors Fleas fig 41.25e Lice fig 41.25f Internal organization fig 41.6 Tubular, somewhat coiled digestive tract Greater coiling associated with sucking mouthparts Dilute digestive enzymes less effective on liquids than solids Anterior and posterior digestive regions lined with cuticle Digestion occurs within stomach or midgut Excretion through Malpighian tubules Trachea extend throughout body, may form air sacs fig 41.7 Spiracles are permanently closed in some aquatic, parasitic forms Fat body is food-storage organ or is similar to vertebrate liver Sense receptors Possess wide variety of sensors in addition to eyes Sensory hairs located all over bodies Sense of taste located on mouthparts Sense of smell located on antennae Sound detected by tympanum, associated with tracheal air sacs fig 41.6a Sensory hairs may also detect sound waves Insect communication Produce sounds which are mostly inaudible to humans Produce chemicals called pheromones Life histories Most insects hatch from eggs outside of the mother`s body Young insects undergo regular ecdysis, stages called instars Simple metamorphosis fig 41.30 Wings develop during juvenile stages Immature stages generally called nymphs Complete metamorphosis fig 41.30 Wings appear only during resting stage just prior to final molt Resting stage called a pupa or chrysalis fig 41.31 Pupa does not normally move, except mosquitos Juveniles and adults live in distinct habitats Development is indirect, larvae are wormlike Larva do not have compound eyes Larvae may or may not have legs fig 41.28,30,31 Generally have chewing mouthparts Pupa generally are usually inactive and do not feed Juvenile hormone controls ecdysis and molting via ecdysone fig 41.32 DEUTEROSTOMES Embryological Feature Shared by Four Phyla Echinodermata, Chordata and two smaller groups Four phyla share common ancestry Characteristics Blastopore becomes anus, mouth develops at other end Have radial cleavage Daughter cells are identical for a brief period of time Produce whole individual if separated Individuals are identical in genetic makeup Whole groups of cells move during embryonic development Coelom produced by evagination of archenteron Archenteron becomes gut cavity PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA: THE ECHINODERMS General Ecology of Echinoderms Ancient group of marine animals, well-represented in fossil record Name means \"spiny skin\" fig 41.33 Examples: sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers Basic Features of Echinoderms Have epidermis stretched over an internal skeleton Endoskeleton composed of ossicles: movable or fixed calcium plates Plates enclosed within living tissue when first formed Bear spines as indicated by phylum`s name Have perforations through which tube feet extend Have a five-part body plan Adults have no head or brain Nervous system composed of circular nerve ring and its branches Capable of complex response patterns, but lack centralized functions Possess a water vascular system Five radial canals extend from a ring canal around the esophagus Radial canals determine basic five-part symmetry fig 41.34a Water enters through madreporite, a sievelike plate Flows to ring canal through the tubular stone canal Radial canals extend out into hollow tube feet fig 41.34b Some echinoderms have suckers at end of tube feet, others do not Each tube foot has a muscular fluid-filled ampulla at its base Feeding strategies of echinoderms Sea cucumbers: tube feet around mouth are modified for feeding fig 41.33b Sea lilies: tube feet arise from branched arms, filter food Brittle stars: tube feet pointed and specialized for feeding fig 41.33d Development of the coelom Large coelom interconnected with complicated system of tubes Helps provide for circulation and respiration Respiration and waste removal occur through skin gills Digestive system is simple but complete: mouth, gut and anus Capable of extensive regeneration Some animals may drop parts when attacked May reproduce asexually by splitting into parts Sexual reproduction and fertilization is external Sexes are separate, but difficult to distinguish externally Develop into free-swimming, bilaterally symmetrical larvae fig 41.35 Significantly different from annelid/mollusk trochophore larvae Larvae possess bands of cilia, used for locomotion Diversity of Echinoderms Class Crinoidea: the sea lilies and feather stars fig 41.33c,36 Mouth and anus located on upper surface in an open disk Simple excretory and reproductive systems Extensive water vascular system Large numbers of highly branched arms located around central disk Filter feeders, food collected by mucus from tube feet on pinnules Sea lilies are attached to a substrate by a stalk Feather stars detach from stalks early in development, attach to substrate by claw-like structures Sexes separate, external fertilization Females \nmay brood young Crinoids resemble early fossil echinoderms Class Asteroidea: the sea stars Most familiar echinoderms, the \"starfish\" fig 41.33a,34 Active, important marine predators Arms prominent and set off from the disk, generally five in number Mouth located in center of the lower surface Often feed on bivalve mollusks fig 41.37 Sexes separate, external fertilization Females may brood young Class Ophiuroidea: the brittle stars fig 41.33d Slender arms more sharply set off from central disk than sea stars Move by active movement of their arms along the substrate Capture suspended particles with tube feet, long spines or arms Arms detach readily, helping protect animals from predators Class Echinoidea: the sea urchins and sand dollars fig 41.33e,f Lack distinct arms, but retain familiar five-part body plan Five rows of tube feet protrude through plates of the skeleton Skeletons are made up of fused calcareous plates Walk along substrate with tube feet or movement of spines Feed on algae, debris scraped off the surfaces by triangular teeth Reproduction similar to other echinoderms Larvae have long arms, unlike those of other classes Class Holothuroidea: the sea cucumbers fig 41.33b Soft, sluglike organisms with tough, leathery outer skin Most lie on sides at the bottom of the ocean Mouth is located on one end Surrounded by tube feet modified into tentacles Tentacles secrete mucus to trap food particles Calcareous skeleton reduced to widely separated, microscopic plates Have highly branched respiratory trees that originate from cloaca Water brought into and out of cloaca by muscular contractions Gas exchange occurs across the respiratory trees Have tube feet on body, may be restricted to five grooves Move by tube feet or wriggling of the entire body

&#150; metazoans -- later animals) Sponges have multiple types of cells but no organized tissues pinacocytes epithelial cells - form outside layer can be contractile - myocyte porocytes form pores in the asconoid sponges choanocytes flagellated cells which line the canals trap food create water currents through the sponge body archaeocytes or amebocytes amoeboid cells which can move throughout the body of the sponge secrete the skeletal spicule and spongin proteins phagocytose and digest food particles area between cells is call mesohyl location of spicules and spongin extracellular matrix cells are not organized into tissues tissues are formed from cells acting in concert to accomplish a function cells of a sponge are not well organized Body forms they have no definite symmetry - most are semi radial body openings ostia (pl) ostium (sing) - let water in - millions of these oscula (pl) osculum (sing) - where water exits only one or few of these there are three body types asconoid - flagellated cells line the interior - spongocoel synconoid - flagellated cells line canals which encircle the spongocoel leuconoid - flagellated chambers within canals - most common type adults are sessile - they are fixed in place and don't move or migrate Reproduction sexual some are monoecious - both male and female gametes produced by one individual others are dioecious - separate male and female gamete producing individuals embryogenesis internal fertilization, embryos are free swimming flagellated larvae which is how sponges become distributed throughout their environment asexual reproduction is also possible budding - entire portion of sponge is constricted and detaches to form a separate individual - sometimes referred to a vegetative reproduction because it is not reproduction due to cell division, but really reproduction due to growth of the entire organism gemmules similar to a cyst a protective, dormant mass of cells which can generate an entire new sponge used by freshwater sponges to survive dehydration and freezing Classification based on types of spicules phylum Porifera with 4 classes class calcarea - all marine CaCO 3 spicules which are straight or have 3-4 rays (spokes) any body type class hexactinellida - glass sponges - all marine have six-rayed spicules made of silica SiO most of these spicules are fused to form a glass-like skeleton
