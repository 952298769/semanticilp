marine boundary AMAP s boundaries The land Ice has shaped the landscape Permafrost creates patterned ground and governs water movement Natural resources are abundant The seas Many coasts feature semi-enclosed bodies of water Sea ice dominates the Arctic Ocean Climate A cold reservoir in a global heat machine The High Arctic is cold and dry Coastal and continental climates can \nbe very different Semi-permanent low-pressure systems govern winds and precipitation A circumpolar voyage Icy island outposts North Atlantic islands: weather ruled by the sea Fennoscandia and Kola: subarctic climate, lakes and forests The Russian Arctic: vast expanses of tundra, wetlands and mountains Alaska: rugged mountains, coastal plains and volcanic islands Canada: from forests to a frozen archipelago Physical pathways of contaminant transport The atmosphere Winter and spring winds carry dirty air Particles take one hop from source to site Volatile substances gain global distribution The breathing oceans Rain, snow, fog, and rime clean the air The land and rivers Snowmelt creates a chemical surge Permafrost makes surface water vulnerable Rivers are key pathways Early summer brings peak input and floods River ice gathers contaminants Lakes and dams trap sediment Wetlands can be contaminant sources Where the river meets the sea Deltas and estuaries serve as particle traps Landfast ice keeps sediments close to shore The continental shelves Sea ice may gather and transport contaminants Water-soluble contaminants follow the brine Open water allows for atmospheric exchange The Arctic Ocean Arctic surface water has a mixed layer and a halocline Atlantic layer circulation has been traced with radionuclides Arctic deep water has extremely long residence time Summary Polar Ecology Arctic conditions Low temperatures slow down biological processes The cold creates a lack of nutrients Snow and ice limit available light Freshwater comes in one short spurt Glaciers have created an evolutionary frontier Strategies for survival Energy is stored in fat Perennial plants save their nutrients Slow growth gives long life Environmental fluctuations are the norm Animal life is concentrated in rich areas Life on land The High Arctic is a desert The Low Arctic is a region of rich tundra Many animals, but short food chains Wetlands are typical of the tundra Summer growth supports migratory birds Tundra ponds are small and acidic Warmer climate can support forests Lakes and streams Freeze thaw cycle governs lake environments Food webs carry nutrients from algae to fish and birds Streams are unstable environments Life in the ocean The pack ice has a unique food web Life is most abundant along the ice edge Zooplankton and fish provide links from algae to mammals Shallow waters have a rich bottom fauna The shelves provide an estuarine environment Summary Peoples of the North United States: Alaska Peoples of Alaska Aleut Alutiiq Athabascan Central Yup ik Eyak

organic pollutants: a background The biological effects of POPs POPs are stored in fat and are persistent A broad attack on reproduction The immune system is very sensitive Liver enzymes are tell-tale signs of intoxication Increased risk of tumors Sensitive glands and vitamin A Porphyria Effect assessments include many uncertainties A cast of characters Industrial chemicals and byproducts PCBs Dioxins and furans Hexachlorobenzene Brominated flame retardants Pesticides DDT Toxaphene Chlordane Hexachlorocyclohexane/lindane Dieldrin Mirex Organotins Less persistent pesticides Sources and pathways Global pool of contaminants is the major source Some pesticides are still produced and used Pesticides have been used for insect control in the Arctic PCBs are still around in buildings and landfills Abandoned military sites are local PCB sources Power stations, oil platforms, mines, and trains are potential PCB sources Arctic smelters and pulp mills have contributed dioxins Levels in the air, snow, and rain Air measurements point to mid-latitude POP-use as source to the Arctic Russian snow and rain have unexpectedly high levels of PCBs and DDT Levels in terrestrial environments Caribou and reindeer have low levels of \nPOPs Waterfowl carry contaminants from overwintering areas The Canadian peregrine falcon still suffers from eggshell thinning Icelandic gyrfalcon accumulate POPs with age Fennoscandian birds of prey are recovering American mink and marten have low contaminant loads Scandinavian mink and otter are bouncing back Red fox and wolf Levels in freshwater environments Some Russian rivers and lakes seem to be very contaminated with POPs Lake sediments have low levels of POPs Canadian data point to toxaphene as a major contaminant in freshwater fish Lake Laberge has high levels of all POPs Levels in marine environments Seawater measurements reflect pathways of contaminant transport Marine sediments are comparatively clean Marine food webs are not well studied Military radar sites may have contaminated marine fish Some seabirds have very high PCB and DDT levels Toothed whales have high levels of POPs Seals in the Barents Sea are more contaminated than in other Arctic regions POP levels in walrus reflect their feeding habits Polar bears are at risk for immune and reproductive effects Time trends Fish and moss in Scandinavia show a decreasing contaminant load Marine animals show a varied geographic picture Summary Heavy Metals Heavy metals an introduction Metals in the environment Mercury (Hg) Cadmium (Cd) Lead (Pb) Selenium (Se) Surrounding environment influences metal uptake Metals can transform and accumulate in the body Sources Natural sources account for a significant part of emissions The metal industry is a major source to the atmosphere Eurasia is the major source region to Arctic air Most emissions are decreasing Metal industry contaminates rivers, lakes, and the ocean Soils serve as dump sites and as sources Atmospheric transport, levels in the air, and deposition The metals follow the prevailing winds Deposition is highest close to smelter stacks Terrestrial ecosystems Some soil concentrations are high enough to damage vegetation Pollution from smelters and oil exploitation shows up in moss Birds and caribou/reindeer accumulate cadmium Freshwater ecosystems Russian rivers are severely polluted with metals Sediments tell about increasing metal loads Is mercury on the rise?",0.9358533620834351]]
