Lesson 2. Describing the Location of an Object After it has Moved Activity 1. Make it Move with a Magnet! Duration: 1 day Background Information A magnet is a solid object that has the ability to attract other magnets or magnetic objects. Magnetic objects are made up of iron and some other metals. Not all metals are attracted to a magnet (e.g. aluminium, copper, zinc, and brass). A magnet doesn’t have to get into contact with a touch a magnetic object to affect it. It can attract a magnetic object from a short distance. Objectives At the end of each lesson, the pupils should be able to: 1. describe how a magnet can move objects; and 2. identify materials that can be moved by magnets. Materials For the teacher: Different magnets, chart similar to activity 6 in the LM For the pupils: Paper clips, cardboard, thumbtacks, small nails, staple wire, eraser, crayon, plastic bottle caps, LM (Activity 6: Make it Move with a Magnet!) Procedure A. Review Ask: What are the things that can make objects move that have been discussed in the previous lessons?
