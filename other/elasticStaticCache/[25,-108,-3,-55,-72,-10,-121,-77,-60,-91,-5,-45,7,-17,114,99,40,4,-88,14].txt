green Upheaveal of human entrails Deterioration of grated genitals, dangling from the hooks Obscene feelings deep inside me Dislocating, separating a blood Drenched body Begin the anal grounting Awaiting insertion, to rip out intestine Bodily destruction Vulgar molestation Treachery never ending soul ripping Lifeless Bodies not, petrified Cloggins veins Presure building Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate Condemned to life of obscurity Dismal dimensions of my being, I explore my thoughts through murder Devoting my life to mutilation Screams of blood saturate, grubs feed on dilapidated Stumps, darkness overshadowing the killing Eyes \nnow dialate Bodies disintegrate Razor sharp hooks implanted in your rectum Splitting bodies, spilling guts on the ground Sodomizing living beings with my utensils Stabbing on your life stripped of all your skin Disgusting to the world Beauty to my eyes The body lying naked, discharging my infection Invigorating while I kill, intoxicating Invoking

One persons tortures, is anothers pleasure Malformation, a diseased brain Unsuspecting slowly dying, as his knife invades The child, screams of pain, no one hears Blood splotches now appear, esctasy through Each cut, now the body twiches the gutted Little torso ready to be cooked Isolated in his own mind the need to kill Now possesses his body Self mutilated Between killings ejaculation, cut off appendages Of former victims, sexual violence satisfaction Disembodied corpses, spewing gore On his body, soaked with their fluids, various Digestive parts, and assorted meats Plunging his fist down the throat, ripping out The guts, internal extraction The entire body bleeding The heart stops pumping The child lying dead, just another gutted infant To satisfy his hunger, temptations of the flesh

Rotten organs, restal pus Spitting up your galbladder Donation of bodily organs carved from broken bodies Eyes melting, skin exploding Every bloody bleeding Meat inter-changed from the mutalated stiffs Parts of the dead are never to rest Lymphatic nodes Implode, while the brain corrodes Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead Creation of a being never known to man Heart pumping pus through the body, sliced in sections, the putrid infection Regaining life from beyond To rip the flesh from your bones Stripped of flesh, unsighty Torn in two, slicing through you Live organs needed to be reanimated Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor, now he lies Dead Awaiting a new brain Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead Exposing their insides, slitting their necks Finding a way

corpse in half Human shit for nurishment Coprophagia, consuming feces of the dying, as their bowels let loose defecation flows down my throat excremental injestment Reflections of things to come, mirored in the dead one's eyes my fantasy of murder Incarnated open wounds gushing, blood on skin coagulated tortured of the retched, no one cares of their dead appaling odor wreaking, piles of rotted bodies The bodies prepared for slaughter, wallowing in your own blood Grinding of your fingers and toes feeding on your meat I immerse my sharpened implement into a fresh bleeding gash her body used for my sick desires The blood thirst I can't control Many more must suffer Disposal of the dead, the corpse chopped to bits licking up the drivel The gore enrages me All I kill a new creation, my work of art bodies torn apart Liver quivering at my feet Eyelids cut off to watch your own dismemberment, cutting through arteries nerves exposed Feel the power of pain COVERED WITH SORES Bleed on me, digesting the clotted scabs Blood thirsty Ungodly Passing on my curse, the spell pussing gores Of those I infect become my loyal servants To ride me of my own rot Whittling meat from the bones of the dead Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge The mutilated bodies I leave rotting after I Have fucked them with my knife Becoming a product of my own nigtmares A bleeding sac of infection, years deceased I hide my slobbering skin Covered by a victims flap I love to watch the blood ooz down the bodies stump Like scap, a vulgar way of life, my hideous side Now revealed Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past Leaking membrane, consuming bodies Carving out the cunts, blood my lubrification Spewing pus on rotted skin I celebrate my Cruelty, boils begin to form, dripping on my tongue

mutilating mortals, the child born unto evil, trapped within the statue of flesh Vipers travel through bodily orifices, blessed by the Devil under inverted crosses, religious ways, lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves I search for decay packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast I suffer forever living only to dismember Open season on humans,

is my fetish Body cavities scraped of guts Brains seeping from cracks as my axe continues to hack RANCID AMPUTATION Torsos hang from their own intestines Raped of all bodily extentions, stumps wreathing in a sludge Like infection Suffering through a Rancid amputation A pulsating artery accomanied by some veins, slit with no restraint Sacs of pus develop My muscles tighten as I feel the rush

slime I'll force you to drink Vessels explode as needles injected Uncontrollable My brain tormented Slit from head to toe, die through the torture Disease engulfs you Internal rot Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot Ripping through flesh is what I do best Tear off an arm Amputated neck Eyes removed, cranium smashed Decomposing remains, severed in half Dying slowly never to rest, nerves are quivering as I trip Removal of life on the blade of my knife Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone Feel my hell, I feed on fright Rape the limbless cadaver INNARDS DECAY Rotting alive Tearing

door i thought was locked and it turns out that it was wide open... silly me forgot to turn the handle... ah well, autopilot seems to have its inherent benefits though... driving from A to B doesn't seem to take as long anymore and strangely enough, my picky taste in music isn't as discerning when i have the local pop station on... sustenance becomes something to chew on and paperwork is a breeze... long hours with little pay, that's the complaint heard around the world... but to me, it's not a complaint... it's just a fact of life... creating a name, now there's a job... how i wish that things were less complicated, less red-tape, less stress-filled... but those thing are not for me to choose... only to weather, and to move on... but the most lovely and delicious thing happened today, on this amazingly windy and brisk day... as i was walking past the tall marble columns of the special olympics building on my way to nexus, i stopped and just let the cool air run it's wispy fingers across my face... and the sun embraced my body with a hint of warmth.... i stood there... in the middle of the breezeway... my black jacket flapping behind me, my wide-legged pants making thrip-thrip noises and my silly tie flying behind me in my silly denim shirt, flying like a dog's tongue hanging out of it's mouth when it is running... and i laughed inside, a slow smile spreading across my face... and i dropped my carry bag, and i put my planner down... streched my arms out a little from each side and just let the world run over my body... i looked up at the darkening orange sky as the clouds raced around the world... and i thought... i... love... living... thanks dad.",0.7499227523803711],["The &quot;click to undress&quot; icon is a smiling face with its tongue hanging
