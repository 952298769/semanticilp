RESONATE LOVE All Rights Reserved Copyright 1997 by Mark Elsis Saviour Of Humanity What a beautiful life given us A paradise for humans to run Live forever or turn to dust Whatever happens it's what we've done And now that we have reached The time to choose our destiny Global unity I do preach Love the saviour of humanity The Rivets Are Popping 500 plus species per day Are leaving the web of life Man's extinction is on the way Cutting our own throats with a knife Like Paul Ehrlich says The rivets are popping We're like a plane in the air And each time a species goes extinct Another rivet pops

mate In a marine sanctuary Now isn't that great Double hulled tankers Once more too late Now the coast of Wales Is in a slippery state What we want we get That is our fate Beauty is vanishing At an

now ripping The unsinkable Titanic Homo Sapiens Pissing In The Wind Propaganda Goebbels Would have been astonished of So neat and packaged now It fits just like an old glove The disorganized majority Always pissing in the wind Fragmantated filled with hatred Only to themselves they've sinned For All Life Is Interdependent First the church Then the government Now the corporation Next the cooperation Of every human on Earth For all life is interdependent Unforeseen Consequences We are way out of control With the 70,000 plus chemicals in use Our children's future we stole The legacy we leave is nothing but abuse Of ourselves and our beautiful planet Earth We do not know the unforeseen consequences Of the interaction all these chemicals together We do not know how they will affect our senses But I can tell you now it won't be for the better Distractions Keep watching those screens Filling you up with useless information There are no need for your dreams We just want a homogenous civilization Distractions everywhere you turn So you're caught up in the game Distractions maybe someday you'll learn Are only here to keep us all the same Blinded Blinded by greed Blinded by ambition Too deaf to heed A slave to submission Materialism fills your days Return on investment rules Corporations have their ways Indoctrination of the fools Don't Worry Don't worry about overpopulation Don't worry about all the pollution Don't worry about deforestation Don't worry about a sustainable solution Don't worry about global warming Don't worry about the ozone hole Don't worry about new viruses forming Don't worry about the kids future we stole Don't worry about nuclear weapons or power Don't worry about pesticides in your food Don't worry about 4000 kids starving to death each hour Don't worry about the TV being stupid and crude Don't worry about all fish stocks declining Don't worry about corrosive life killing acid rain Don't worry about the massive strip

downsizing Don't worry about recycling your trash Don't worry about genetic engineering Don't worry about it ending in a flash Don't worry about anything you're fearing Because our complete devastation of all life Is now irreversible Once Filled With Hope I try to find hope But there is none to be found It is getting harder to cope With the devastation all around I try to find hope But I'm disappointed every time I'm at the end of my rope Waiting for humanity to pay for its crime I try to find hope But it is irreversibly too late I was once filled with hope But now I know that which is to be our fate The Weight Of The World I want to see the majesty I want to sense the wonder I want to advert the tragedy I want to stop the blunder The weight of the world The time running out The hate constantly unfurled The crime of silence all about The Pervasive Charade Keep it up Prop it up Never let it fall The pervasive charade Is now spoken By all A Dead Canary In A Coal Mine Like the lemmings Marching to the sea I see all of humanity Racing to the end A dead canary In a coal mine that's me Warning us now The Earth needs to mend To Bare Witness Take a stand Show your voice Together we band For we have no choice But to bare witness To our own desolation Hoodwinked Cheated deceived swindled We've all been hoodwinked A long long time ago The democrats and republicans Devilishly sold their souls To the corporate interests Now we can look forward to Destruction devastation annihilation Brought to us so sweetly In a candy coated wrapper The Masters Biddings Corruption pervasively Imbedded throughout the land The masters biddings Woven into the fabric of our lives Eradication perversely Unending on a scale so grand The billion starving babies During my life's dying cries Apathy prevailing The conditioned sheep are all around The masters biddings Are now done without a thought or sound A Unity Of One Percent A unity of one percent Who revere all life on Earth as dear Must begin to form today If there's any wish for survival here A unity of one percent Resonates when thinking as one Causing a critical mass Where sustainability will become Upon all future generations Consume Less Running from here to there And then back again and again For this that and all the other Silly useless and wasteful things We no longer are looking to share Like we did way back when Almost everyone helped one another Lost is the happiness this brings Open yourself try voluntary simplicity Learning to consume less is so freeing Show the corporations no complicity Slow down enough to just enjoy being If You Believed If you believed such as I What would you do With all your heart would you try Never stop till the one percent knew If you believed such as I What would you do Just wait for humanity to die Given up because it can't be true If you believed such as I What would you do Keeping The Status Quo Alive Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation A masterful job where PR firms strive And a dumbing down of education Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The place media conglomerates strive And all Hollywood produces obfuscation Keeping the status quo alive In the face of certain annihilation The part for politicians so desperately strive A government act of incautious deliberation Tinkering With Divine Creation Playing with deadly radiation Like a bunch of babbling babies Tinkering with divine creation Never caring about all the maybes Trying to genetically engineer life While your own species goes extinct Lying to hide all inequitable strife When to Earth you are forever linked The Oligarchy Desperate ubiquitous inequalities Executed by the privileged few Horrendous nightmarish actualities Brought to billions of a darker hue The oligarchy are indubitably maleficent Running the Earth 24 / 7 with never a rest Her straining systems now going inefficient As any future generation so sadly will attest A New Ethic Of Caring A new ethic of caring For all life on Earth is needed A humane way of sharing Where reverence for all life is treated A new ethic of caring Must now form quickly from you and me For the web of life is tearing Apart much faster then anyone is willing to see A new ethic of caring Or our species will be taken care of From bad to worse will go our faring Till in the end there was no more love Our Rightful Place Amongst the abundance For which nature provides Our rightful place Is when harmony arrives With all life on Earth Complexity Complexity far beyond our imagination Yet we arrogantly go about our merry way Diversity being felled in one generation Never again to see the light of a bright new day The intricacy of all living beings on one another We know so little about and don't seem to care Variety being extinguished to put out and smother For future generations there will be nothing to share Imperative Each and every day I have dreams Of a better world for all Each and every way though it seems On deaf ears my words fall Quite troubling this is for me When there is nothing more imperative My job here is for as many to see That now is the time we can't be sedative Our Responsibilities Dereliction of our earthly stewardship \nIn almost every way that is conceivable Our responsibilities long ago we let slip The utter stupidity of man is unbelievable Build your weapons and let millions starve Have your religion and plunder the resources Take every rainforest to cut up and carve Follow the leaders blindly until your losses Are no more Love Must Spread The Word You who do not see You who do not care You who say it can not be You who deny it and swear You must be awakened today By those of you who know the truth By all of you who have seen the light It is you who with love must spread the word It is you who must show others what's right Precarious Equilibrium Humanity is walking the highwire Insanity is pushing the envelope Precarious equillibrium is so dire In a world that is going for broke The Obedient Masses They do just what they're told They are the obedient masses It doesn't matter what's being sold Just stay in your station caste classes And now as the world is going to hell They still have little to no concern Their souls to the devil they gladly sell Will the obedient masses ever learn They have the power within themselves To change the course of history The Worst Of All Our Atrocities To damage nature the way we are Is the worst of all our atrocities To ransack her from near and far Forever diminishes our perpetuation We have but a small yet significant role In the elaborate interdependence of all things Living a sustainable life with congruity the goal And a love of the diversity that all life brings Will stop this damage toward nature that we do With the worst of all our atrocities finally ending But until that day comes all I can say to you Is that nature is dying when it needs to be mending Sweet Intricate Beauty Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye to all we knew My White Rhino beauty Good-bye to fine details In the superstring soup Good-bye to friend chaos No butterflies in the loop Good-bye forever to you Sweet intricate beauty Good-bye it can't be true Humanity has failed its duty The Window Of Opportunity The window of opportunity Is staring us squarely in the face Begging us to form a unity Before we fall from natures grace Smell The Roses In this hurried up To make money society With television constantly Enslaving you to consume Try to often stop And smell the roses quietly Meditate and exercise daily To keep one in tune You Create Your Own Reality Keep an open mind Look at every angle Seek and you shall find What your heart desires You create your own reality Which in turn Reflects your daily personality The being that you are The aura that surrounds Repercussions It's dying before me Will we act in time Restore the earth or you'll be Taken away to make it fine Distorted Views Misinformation disinformation Cover ups and lies It doesn't matter which administration They're all cut from the same pies Distorted views Slanted news It'll make you numb What right to choose You'll only lose Are the thoughts of some One Every Second They're dying of starvation One every second They're praying for salvation From the misery there born in But we turn our backs Having our own problems getting by Avoiding the horrid facts While the 3rd world babies cry Till death The Beings From Afar The beings from afar Must look at us and laugh Just babies in evolution Crawling down extinction's path John Lennon You made me write the words I do I'll even admit I idolized you Your assassination ended an era so they say But your message still lives in me each day And I'll reach the masses because I feel That certain destruction is for real If our ways don't change from what is now And stop the killing weapons we let allow Oh the hypocrisy we let go on The human civilization ends with a con With shortsighted leaders sedating us all Technology betrays with apathy we fall As Confusion Creeps In Coming down on your self As confusion creeps in Forgetting pain ruining health What is moral what is sin Each day blurs by Does anything really matter Alone sometimes I cry Wondering will tomorrow be sadder The Atomic Hump Five evolution's to get it right And here we go again Constantly in conflict and fight I think it's time to say when Enough is enough I'm bored of the game Drop the act of being tough Finally realize we're all the same I call it the atomic hump The make or break time Flourish on earth as one Or pay for the ultimate crime The Best We Can Days drift by one by one Each day closer to having none Wake up and see where your eyes are blind Look both ways and then you'll find We need a way for all mankind To live together the best we can No more arms to kill each other Population curbed for another Pollution stopped or we'll smother Hunger fed love your brother Confined To Conformity Confined to conformity Stuck in your ways Living so uniformly Trapped in your maze Feed Them Guns Feed them guns While innocent die Starving mother's sons Have nothing left to try Money making weapons We will supply When farming technology Is the pleading cry Piece Of Debris Number Three Piece of debris number three Has been rendered useless \nMismanaged shortsightedly Plundered expediently Forever In Harmony It's make or break One more time Will we cover ourselves In our prime Or learn to live As meant to be Back with nature Forever in harmony Which we choose Is up to us Either we fuse Or forever rust But now's the time To make the choice And only together we'll find They'll hear our voice To make the changes That have to be For us to live Forever in harmony A Generation Of Lunacy I'm given every opportunity But yet feel so defeated Born into a generation of lunacy Where with destruction I'm greeted I feel a failure With no future in store A no win situation With materialism the whore From One Another It's all stealing From one another Sell with feeling Beat your brother Get rich quick While humans starve Your fcking sick But still you carve Strip till it's bare No more tomorrow's For children to share There will only be sorrows The Sin Of Sins Human reality Skillfully corrupted Meager mortality Nuclear deducted The sin of sins The killing weapons No one wins Stop the deceptions Life would cease In vain again War over peace Another lesson when Too much was learned And turned to kill Suicide was confirmed But they went ahead still Who's Fooling Who When you just don't care And see through the lies When you know it ain't fair Yet you don't even criticize Your just as wrong Being weak and accepting Giving into the strong Who think their decepting But who's fooling who And who'll laugh last When in the end you knew What you've learned in the past The Cry Of Helplessness Come to your senses It won't hold out Man's raped nature There is no doubt We've grown too fast Become a burden Taxed the system And called it progress The peak of selfishness To make life easy The cry of helplessness Follow If You Wish The family unit decays Our morals slip away And still the politicians say Tomorrow will bring a better day Follow if you wish But suicides the risk And ignorance the dish You feed upon Without Weapons In this age of technology With hunger disease and pollution You give only your apology Because you think there's no solution To the arms race we let go on To instinct survival Passive to the deadly harm To evolve this far Just to be had by a con You apathetic humans With no sense of direction You follow like sheep Just tell me why Cause without weapons We would flourish Live without fear Every human nourished We could end diseases And all the suffering But still you follow like sheep To Take All That's There Each new day So much goes down A life so busy Just revolving around Money and power Greed and despair Living each hour To take all that's there Insanity Can't Last See the signs There all around Pay the fines to Mother earth's ground Birds and animals Their disappearing Man is next Yes I'm fearing Evolution too fast Is the reason Insanity can't last Taking each season Till nothing grows From the ground Only pollution flows With radiation found In you and me A Vicious Circle All the vices All the crutches All the choices That pass us by Escaping them all To get high It's a vicious circle Hard to break Where nothing matters When it's all at stake Follow Aimless Sheep Apathy will prevail On this earth I'm sure Follow aimless sheep So easy to ignore The extinction of life Throwing nature off balance Will one day catch man For there's no avoiding If Only We'd Try How long does it take For you to see How can I make it So all can be Free from pain With no more weapons No soldiers slain By monetary deceptions No TMI The sun is ours If only we'd try To unite the powers And stop the deceptions We let go on But each election You fall for the con In hopes of better When there all the same How long does it take You to get wise to the game They're out for now And backed by an interest Gates Of Heaven A warm December night I passed by The Dakota Sunroof open barely creeping An hour before the end I saw a shadow Lurked in the darkness I thought security Because the article How many times I've past before Those iron gates Can I cry once more Since I was five I've heard the words Now only vinyl Is left to hear The Tears Did Shed For You Billy Will it get better Will it get worse There's rainy weather With a black hearse The tears did shed While not believing A word you said So much grieving Did leave me numb And memories ago Kept filtering through Of a time when no It can not be Ever again Start To Care Now The situation is critical Time is of the essence The answer is not political Each day gone by lessens Our very survival here What we can do Is up to you and me We can save ourselves If we want it to be Where our grandchildren Can laugh and play Start to care now Please don't turn away It starts in you It starts in me Help restore our earth So future generations can be We Make Each minute that passes 100 acres of tropical forest Goes never to come back Within just one hour 4000 \nchildren starve to death While surplus crops go bad Every day that goes by There are 27 oil spills In the United States alone In one orbit around the sun More than a trillion dollars Of killing weapons we make In Order To Exist Its come so quick Its hard to tell In just a flick We've emptied the well Foresight is cheap When it's too late We're sinking in deep Still wanting the bait Computer malfunction Warning overload Drastic measures needed In order to continue We must all realize this is it We must change In order to exist As If By Divine Plan Take some time And think about this Listen real careful Cause there's no time to miss It's getting beyond reach It's gotten out of hand The power hungry preach As if by divine plan And you don't know Or just let it go by And you're always on the go But always asking why They drain your life Squeeze every last drop Tell you of freedom When looking from the top Groomed Puppets That Deceive How clever the manipulation In this land of the free How money breeds dedication In the name of liberty With political promising lies You know better than believe They're all the same you realize Groomed puppets that deceive So you give up hope Believing it will never change Apathy is how you cope Something you always found strange Without Deception The ladder of success With cut out steps Leads you nowhere Without deception Too Much Too Soon And Then Well here we are again Apathetic up till the end Too much too soon and then No recourse Take Take Take It's total chaos It's complete madness It can't go on It'll never last Take take take Until no more Is left to give Test Subjects We are the test subjects We are the dying breed We are the last checks Here to balance the greed An awaken you all So we can plant a new seed Knock down the wall That strangles you like a weed We are here to change Extinction to perpetuation Get rid of the strange Leading us to devastation It's all up to us To want a new day With us you can trust We won't lead you astray What's best for all Is the way it will be Knock down the wall For unity is the key And it won't be easy Cause they're set in their way Molded in the cast Until their dying day Which won't be long So we have no time to waste We've already been led along So now we have to haste And think for tomorrow Forget about yesterday It will only bring you sorrow And happiness is the only way Evolution's Choice Is Now Sand slipping through The hour glass Evolution's choice is now Humanity's last pass Won't wait Tomorrow's awareness In vain too late Today's judgment Decides earth's fate You've Given Up Hope You've given up hope You can't change the system Mellowing out with age You no longer try to resist them You've lost your morals They've changed your ways But deep down it eats at you They've trapped you in the maze Torn between the dream you had And the life you live Still knowing your being had But not wanting to give Inhospitable In every way possible We're destroying ourselves Making tomorrow inhospitable As long as today it sells Extinct Is Forever Man's the enemy Technology the tool Extinct is forever Don't be a fool And say it's all right Or laugh it away Stand up and fight Our numbers will say Something positive That will catch like fire An expose all the greedy Cold hearted liars To Shed Some Light I try to write About what I feel is wrong To shed some light About how we're led along In this land of the free We must be brave For our future you see A new road we must pave Playing Fate With Dice We are our own god For good or bad Our earth paradise So don't be mad In the years to come We pay the price Following blinded leaders Playing fate with dice A Merry Go Round It's just the same old game With the played out scenes A merry go round with inbetweens Lost in a fog in a sea of confusion Looking for help through realities illusion Got to break out and get away Or the conditioning ties will stay Trapping you till tomorrow's today Becomes a bitter memory of yesterday Government Sponsored There's no way out Unless you care I can scream and shout About what ain't fair But you've got to change From deep inside Brought up fast and strange Don't run and hide From the troubled day By taking drugs To escape the pain It's a cover up To keep us down Government sponsored Every pound Throw In The Towel Toxic dumps Radiation leaks Cancer lumps Mutated freaks Toxic shock Agent orange Government mock Goes on and on Nuclear waste Leukemia rate Technology haste Is our fate Love canal TMI Throw in the towel And wave good-bye Oil

up Make you give up Take Responsibility Turn away And it only gets worse Stay in the gray Until your in the hearse \nTake responsibility And it can only get better We have the ability It's just the choice of whether We take responsibility Or turn away When Humanity Wept How do you cope With global suicide How do you hope When you turn and hide What is there left For you to believe in When humanity wept Drowned in their grieving I Still Imagine In first grade My President was blown away I wondered why In fifth grade Martin and Robert were filled with lead I began to understand In the summer before high school Morrison was in French soil But no one was there I became scared For John The warmest 8th of December In New York City history I was driving my cab When Vinny broke the news From that day till now At 29 Every time I pass 1 West 72nd street I feel humanity Has no hope But I still imagine A Paradise Yours Pure There's always been war You don't learn by mistakes A paradise yours pure And only one for the takes For Tomorrow Today We're at the time When we can't look away We need a solution For tomorrow today A Handful Of Companies A handful of companies Make the

Population Visible at Great Distance fig 28.1 Population Impacts the Environment Total population of the earth in 1995 reached 5.7 billion More people consume more food, water, energy and raw materials More people create greater amount of waste A GROWING POPULATION Historical Perspective Earliest fossils from Europe are 500,000 years old Humans spread to North America 12,000 years ago Population 10,000 years ago was only 5 million With agriculture, populations rapidly expanded More dependable sources of food fig 28.2 Development of towns and cities Bubonic plague in 1348 killed nearly four-fifths of population fig 28.3 Recovery and increase to 500 million by 1650 Seventeenth century Renaissance renewed interest in science Scientific developments led to Industrial Revolution The Present Situation Global birth rate for last 300 years: 30 per year per 1000 people Present rate decreased slightly to 25 per 1000 Decreased death rate to 9 per 1000 people per year Net increase in annual population rate Population increasing \nat rate of 1.6% per year Will double population in 43 years Annual increase of 90 million per year Increase per minute of 170 people United Nation estimates population of 6 billion by 2000 AD Expected stabilization at 8.5 to 18 billion by 2090 Must stabilize population due to limited resources The Future Situation Localization of human populations in year 2000 60% in tropical or subtropical regions 20% in China 20% in developed or industrialized nations People in industrialized areas control 85% of wealth and materials Standard of living 20 times higher Lower infant mortality rate Higher life expectancy Variable world age structure affects population growth Industrialized nations: 20% of population under 15 years Developing countries have nearly twice as many fig 28.4 Populations of developing countries will continue to grow faster Industrialized nations will constitute smaller portion of the global population Quality of life dependent on stabilizing world`s population THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE Immediate World Challenge to Produce More Food Food production increased by 2.6 times since 1950 Population expanded at greater rate Most cultivatable land already in use Topsoil lost from agricultural land Consumption in developed countries increasing at greater rate Must Increase Agricultural Productivity Identify new crops, especially in tropics Major crops have been cultivated for thousands of years Few new plants cultivated since 1800 Examples: rubber and oil palms Crops selected for ease of growth Kinds of Agricultural Crops Three primary food crops: corn, wheat, rice 5000 types have ever been used for food, only 150 used regularly Various plants used for medical treatments Reasons for cultivating new plants Altered standards of cultivation Extraction of industrial products, oils, drugs, chemicals The Prospects for More Food Must increase productivity of current crops Improvement needed in tropical and subtropical regions Improvement of strains via Green Revolution: 1950-1970 Ten-fold increase in Mexican wheat production Food production in India outpaced population growth China became self-sufficient in food production Limitations of Green Revolution Agricultural techniques require great energy output Extensive use of costly pesticides and herbicides Commercial prices held low in developing areas Present solutions Improve production of current crops Not likely to bring more land into agricultural use Fully apply traditional means of plant breeding and selection fig 28.6 Include wheat, corn and rice Develop new crops in tropics and subtropics Develop improved strains via genetic engineering Resistance to specific herbicides results in better weed control Tolerance to soil conditions and mineral toxicity Ability to fix nitrogen Use of hydroponic agriculture problematic Resources of oceans are not inexhaustible Reduce over fishing of specific areas Develop new microorganism-based foods: Spirulina OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Nuclear Power Chernobyl incident One of four reactors exploded in April 1986 Emergency safety systems shut off Power surge precipitated the explosion Released over 100 megatons of radioactivity Millions of times greater than Three Mile Island Significant human exposure to radiation Death due to radiation poisoning The promise of nuclear power Fossil fuels no longer cheap sources of energy Nuclear power could provide new source Undesirable side effects to burning fossil fuels Produces sulfur and carbon dioxide New problems associated with nuclear power Safe operation of power plants Disposal of radioactive wastes Safe decommission of power plants Prevention of terrorism and sabotage Important to develop other alternative energy sources Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming CO2 in atmosphere maintains world temperature 25% higher than without it Traps heat-producing infrared light Creates greenhouse effect Associated with increased energy use Most gas from burning of fossil fuels Burning of forests also increases atmospheric gas Global warming results from increased CO2 Mean global temperature increased 1% since 1900 Masked by heat-absorbing capacity of oceans Level of CO2 could double by 2035 Warming exacerbated by trace gases Include chlorofluorocarbons Absorb infrared wavelengths better than CO2 Ancillary problems Rising sea levels Altered growth rates in plants Leads to global climate change Pollution Example: Rhine river Fire in chemical warehouse washed chemicals into river Deadly mercury and pesticides killed fish and plants Water became unsafe to drink River slowly cleaned itself The Threat of Pollution Results from industrial byproducts Plastics cannot decompose Efforts being made to develop new microorganisms yet unsuccessful Water pollution Not enough water to dispose of wastes Detergents increase algae, decrease water quality Agricultural pollution Widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers fig 28.7 Toxic chemicals remain in ecosystems Chlorinated hydrocarbons banned in U.S. Concentrate in the food chain Must develop responsible attitude toward use of chemicals Acid Precipitation Sulfur compounds produced when coal burned fig 28.8 Mixes with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid Acid dispersed by winds high up in atmosphere Effects seen far from where acids are produced Biological consequences Death of thousands of fresh water lakes fig 28.9 Seepage into groundwater Destruction of forests fig 28.10 Expensive to capture and remove emissions The Ozone Hole Visible to electronic equipment over Antarctica fig 28.11 Hole is nearly the size of the U.S. Thinning of ozone layer first appeared in 1975 Presence of hole coincides with Antarctic spring Cause of ozone hole attributed to chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) Chemicals used in cooling, fire extinguishers and styrofoam CFC`s reduce O3 ozone molecule to O2 gas Global agreements to halt CFC production Problem will get worse because of quantity currently in lower atmosphere that will reach upper atmosphere in later years Biological consequences Increased ultraviolet light penetration Increases incidence of human skin cancers Damage to photosynthetic plankton Destruction in the Tropics Traditional method of shifting agriculture fig 28.12 Crops grow for only a few years in poor soils Require decades without crops to rebuild nutrients High population density does not permit renewal No longer sufficient for even traditional manioc crop Dead materials collected for firewood, not recycled Forests being cleared at too great a rate Equal to the size of Indiana per year At the present rate they will be gone in thirty years Need to change from one-use to \ncontinuous agriculture fig 28.13 The Loss of Biodiversity Serious and rapidly accelerating problem Given the loss of species of known plants and animals Given the loss of habitat, especially in tropics Calculate loss of 20% of biodiversity within in next 30 years Loss greater considering we have named only 15% of world's eukaryotic organisms Loss important for several reasons Moral, ethical and aesthetic grounds Organisms necessary to sustain our own existence Opportunity to study them lost Also lose potential benefits of these organisms Upset balance of living communities and their physical environment Effect soils, water regulation, nutrient cycles, atmosphere and climate, absorb pollution Creating conditions of instability and unproductivity Little known about overall ecology of communities and ecosystems Cannot replace with systems that will support humans Damage is currently irreparable ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Attempts to Find Solutions to Environmental Problems Studied by environmental scientists Applied science associated with ecology, geology, meteorology Environmental Problems Can Be Solved fig 28.14 Assessment Gathering information Construct model of situation Use model to predict future events Risk analysis Analyze environmental impact Evaluate potential for solving problem Determine adverse effects of solution Public education Address problem in terms the public can understand Present alternative actions Explain costs and results of various choices Political action Choice made through elected officials Difficult to implement if multinational problems Follow-through Monitor results of environmental actions Evaluate and improve initial analysis and modeling WHAT BIOLOGISTS HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE Environmental Problems Require Applications of Biological Principles All living things need to use energy of the sun Need to understand basic principles and their applications Some areas of world are experiencing the future`s problems now Scientific

Save the Planet&quot; QUIZ #1 (Due at the Midterm Review) A graphic representation of changes in the size of human populations over time would illustrate: linear growth the human birth rate constant growth exponential growth The two general types of pollution control are known as: linear and exponential Perpetual and exhaustible Input ant output Point and non point Renewable and nonrenewable The first law of energy (thermodynamics) applies to all forms of energy except nuclear energy applies to all forms of energy except solar power is used to predict the products of nuclear reactions says that energy quality and energy quantity are interchangeable says that energy input always equals energy output A &quot;sustainable earth&quot; society would: recycle both materials and energy efficiency rely on &quot;input&quot; methods to reduce materials waste and prevent pollution produce no waste except heat exceed the capacity of the earth to dilute waste and absorb excess heat rely only on nonpolluting solar energy The greatest diversity of animal species is found in tropical rainforests because: mammals thrive on the hot, humid climate the complex structure of the rain forest provides more niches these rainforests contain no predators the water supply in these forests is rich in nutrients both a and d are true The process whereby atmospheric nitrogen is transformed into a usable form by plants is called: solvation denitrification Rhizobium nitrolysis nitrogen fixation The carbon cycle involves: atmospheric carbon dioxide the carbon in molecules of living organisms carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water carbon in limestone all of the above The soil of tropical rainforests is generally unsuitable for agriculture because: most nutrients are in the profuse vegetation instead of the soil potassium is leached from the soil by runoff from heavy rains plant roots make it difficult to plow the soil forest plants secrete material toxic for crops more than one of the above Populations tend to be more concentrated in industrial societies because: factories need a ready nearby labor supply food supplies are greater in cities this is the most environmentally sound distribution social services are greater in cities than the countryside none of the above The trans-Alaska pipeline marked a milestone for environmental awareness because: it posed no hazards to the environment it was too far from population centers to be of environmental significance it was the first major development project for which environmental considerations were important during planning and construction no environmental impact statements were required for this project Which of the following is not one of the reasons for the Agricultural Revolution that coincided with the Industrial Revolution: development of chemical insecticides development of crop rotation deep plowing in straight rows enclosed fields instead of the use of a common area animal breeding and use of livestock for plowing Early man: had high fertility and low morality rates overstressed their environment were nomadic hunter-gathers exploited areas beyond recovery and then moved to new areas first appeared 12,000 years ago Scientist now believe that damage done to the ozone layer is caused by: increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun chlorofluorocarbos and halons carbon monoxide and methane the &quot;winter vortex&quot; over the South Pole more than one of the above The rate and magnitude of global warming from greenhouse effect: are beyond human ability to influence can be restrained if action is taken soon can be predicted by computer models are already &quot;out of control&quot; both b and c The increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could be slowed by: decreased fossil fuel burning decreasing rates of population growth planting trees preventing the escape of Freon refrigerants all of the above Present climate models predict and improvement in growing conditions in

existence & face imminent starvation 1,000,000,000 people in the west gorging on meat & dairy leave 1,000,000,000 to waste away & 3,500,000,000 teeter on the brink LAND If they continue to clear American forests to raise cattle at the present rate, in 50 years there will be none left 1 acre yields 165 lbs of beef or 20,000 lbs of potatoes 8/10 of cultivated land in the UK is used to grow food for animals (14,732,000 hectares) It takes 16lbs of high protein soya to produce 1 lb of beef Since 1945 in the UK we have lost 95% of flower meadows, 50% of ancient woodlands, 40% of heathlands, 50% of wet lands & 224,000 km of hedgerows all due to animal farming Pressure on land due to meat farming leads to soil erosion 6billion tons/year in the USA If everyone went vegetarian upto 90% of land used for animal farming could be taken out of production & used to replant woodlands, leisure activities etc. 25% of Central america's forests have been destroyed for cattle grazing since 1960 Between 1966-1983 38% of the Amazon rain forest was destroyed for cattle grazing 90% of cattle ranches established on cleared forest land go bankrupt in less than 8 years as the land becomes barren due to nutrient loss & overgrazing Overgrazing by cattle is destroying the land & increasing desertification, nearly 430 million acres in the USA alone has suffered a 25-50% reduction in yield since first grazed An inch of topsoil takes 200-1000 years to develop - yet in the USA they have lost around 1/3 of their prime topsoil in 200 years (around 7 inches) due to animal farming Land will be lost due to rises in sea level due to global warming due to animal farming AIR The destruction of the rainforest by cattle farmers is destroying the lungs of the planet & reducing the worlds capacity to replenish our oxygen supply The 1,300,000,000 cattle in the world emit 60,000,000 tons of methane per year (methane is a greenhouse gas & leads to global warming) Burning of forests, grasslands & agricultural waste associated with animal farming releases 50-100,000,000 tons of methane per year Combining these figures, 25% of methane emissions are due to animal farming (not including the billions of sheep, pigs & poultry so the real figure is much higher) Fertilizer used to grow crops to feed to animals releases nitrous oxide - thought to account for 6% of the greenhouse effect Fertilizer, weedkiller & pesticides sprayed on crops enter the atmosphere creating a noxious carcinogenic cocktail CFCs are released into the air from refrigeration units used to store decomposing flesh (meat), milk & butter - CFCs are destroy the ozone layer Ammonia from animal urine also pollutes the atmosphere CO2 is released by burning oil & petrol in lorries, ships, abattoirs, dairies, factories etc. associated with meat & dairy production Emissions from large chemical plants which produce fertilizer, weedkiller & other agricultural chemicals are also poisoning our air WATER 25 gallons of water to produce 1lb of wheat & 2500 gallons to produce 1lb of meat UK farm animals produce 200,000,000 tonnes of slurry (liquid excrement) every year, the majority of which ends up in our rivers Bloody waste water from abattoirs ends up in our rivers In the USA every second humans produce 12,000 lbs of effluent while farmed animals produce 250,000 lbs Nitrates & pesticides used on crops grown to feed livestock end up in our rivers Meat & dairy farming uses 70 litres of water per day per animal in the UK or 159,250,000,000 litres per year in total The water used to produce 10 lbs of steak is equivalent to the average consumption of water for an entire household for an entire year Depletion of groundwater reserves to grow crops for animals & to supply abattoirs will lead to greater water shortages Aquafers (stores of underground water) in the San Joaquin valley in the USA are being drained at the rate of 500,000,000,000 gallons/year to produce meat 18% of all agricultural land in the world is irrigated & as global warming increases (partly due to animal farming) it will cost $200,000,000 to keep these systems going The water used to produce a 1000 lb beef steer is enough to float a Destroyer battleship The liquid waste from the various parts of the meat & dairy industry flow into the rivers & from there into the seas polluting them & encouraging huge algal blooms to grow EFFICIENCY To produce 1calorie of energy from meat takes 60 calories of petrol, whereas growing grains & legumes to directly feed people produces 20 calories for each calorie of fuel used ( thats 1200 times more efficient) Meat & dairy farming uses billions of gallons of oil to run tractors, fuel ships & lorries (to move animal feed & animals), pump billions of gallons of water to irrigate fields & run slaughterhouses, power refrigeration units to prevent the corpses from decomposing & to power sewage plants to \nclean up some of the pollution produced Cattle convert only 6% of their energy intake (mainly grains & soya) into flesh, the remaining 94% is wasted as heat, movement (which is why they keep many animals in very close confinement), hair, bones, faeces etc 1lb of beef takes 1 gallon of petrol to produce A family of four eating beef for a year uses enough petrol to run a car for 6 months (obviously depending on how far you drive",0.6510047316551208],["X1021945080-00221-50844</DOCNO> Chapter Twenty-Six Extended Lecture Outline Chapter 26 Extended Lecture Outline Chapter Outline INTRODUCTION Ecosystems Are the Most Complex Level of Biological Organization Include living and nonliving factors Transfer of energy is regulated, nutrients are cycled Earth is a closed system with respect to nutrients and chemicals System is open with respect to energy Ecosystems May Have Clearly Recognizable Boundaries Ecosystems change over time and become new ecosystems Changes are gradual and adapt to particular conditions Overall characteristics of populations adjust to the new conditions BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES All Substances in Organisms Cycle Through Ecosystems fig 26.1 The bulk of these are not contained within the bodies of organisms Contained within the atmosphere: carbon, nitrogen and oxygen Contained within rocks: phosphorus, potassium and other minerals Substances are incorporated from nonliving sources into organisms Returned to non-living world through decomposition The Water Cycle fig 26.2 All life depends directly on the presence of water Energy from sun powers the evaporation of water into atmosphere Most falls back into the oceans or subsurface bodies of water 98% of earth`s water is free, only 2% is fixed All organisms require water to live Plants obtain water from the earth Animals drink water or obtain it by eating plants Water occurs as surface and ground water Aquifers are permeable saturated layers of rock, sand and gravel Ground water is an important reservoir of water Water table: the unconfined portion of ground water Ground water flows more slowly than surface water Rate of use is increasing enormously Many aquifers are threatened with depletion Pollution in groundwater is a serious problem The Carbon Cycle fig 26.3 Based on atmospheric carbon dioxide Synthesis of organic compounds fixes 700 billion metric tons yearly Accomplished by various photosynthesizers All heterotrophic nonphotosynthesizers depend on their activity Carbon dioxide released into atmosphere when organisms decompose Some carbon compounds are accumulated Cellulose is more resistant to breakdown May eventually be incorporated into fossil fuels or minerals 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 are dissolved in the ocean Fossil fuels contain 500 billion metric tons 600 to 1000 billion metric tons contained within organisms Processes of respiration and photosynthesis are roughly balanced Carbon dioxide increasing as a result of burning fossil fuels May be altering global climates The Nitrogen Cycle fig 26.4 Nitrogen gas constitutes 78% of the atmosphere Very little nitrogen is fixed in the soil, oceans and organisms Few organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms All are nitrogen-fixing bacteria Triple bond linking nitrogen atoms makes the gas very stable Process is enzyme catalyzed and utilizes ATP Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living Some form symbiotic relationships with plants Fix enough nitrogen to be of significance Plants can grow in soils with low amounts of nitrogen Bacteria and fungi rapidly decompose nitrogen-containing compounds Use products to synthesize own proteins, release excess as ammonium Process called ammonification Fixed nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification The Oxygen Cycle Only the earth possesses significant quantities of free oxygen Free oxygen is a product of three billion years of photosynthesis Without continued photosynthesis, respiration would deplete all nonatmospheric oxygen in fifty years The Phosphorus Cycle fig 26.5 Most biogeochemical cycle reservoirs in minerals, not atmosphere Phosphates exist in the soil in only small amounts Are relatively insoluble and contained in only certain kinds of rocks Weather out of rocks, transported to oceans Brought up by natural uplift of land masses or by marine animals Form rich natural deposits of guano from sea birds Millions of tons of phosphates added to farm land each year Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is called superphosphate Made by treating calcium phosphate with sulfuric acid Biogeochemical Cycles Illustrated: Recycling in a Forested Ecosystem Evidence in studies of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Central stream of large temperate deciduous forest \nwatershed Measure water and nutrient flow made through concrete weirs Conclusions: undisturbed watershed efficiently retained nutrients Instructive with regard to loss of rainforest area to crops Experimental felling of trees and shrubs in one of six watersheds Amount of water runoff increased by 40% Amount of nutrients lost was greatly increased Conclusion: fertility lost, danger of flooding increased THE FLOW OF ENERGY Ecosystems Contain Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Autotrophs capture light energy and manufacture own food Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs Energy captured is slowly released through metabolic processes Primary Productivity Primary productivity: amount of organic matter produced from solar energy per area per time Gross primary productivity: total amount of energy converted to organic compounds per area per unit time Net primary productivity: total amount of energy fixed per unit of time minus energy expended in organismal metabolic activities Biomass: total weight of all organisms living in the ecosystem Increases as a result of net productivity High net productivity in cornfield ecosystem High net productivity, low biomass in tropical rainforest ecosystem Comparative net primary productivity: biomass ratios Tropical forest and marshlands = 1500 to 3000 grams/year Temperate forest = 1100 to 1500 grams/year Dry deserts = 200 grams/year Estuaries, coral reefs, sugarcane fields = 3600 to 9100 grams/year Intertidal zone = 14,600 grams/year Trophic Levels Green plants convert 1% of the sun`s energy Less energy converted by the animals that eat plants Levels of consumers Primary consumers: herbivores, feed on green plants Secondary consumers: carnivores and parasites feed on herbivores Decomposers: break down matter accumulated in bodies of organisms Detrivores: live on dead organisms and cast-off parts of organisms fig 26.6 Such trophic levels exist in all complicated ecosystems Organisms from each level compose food chain Relationships are more accurately branching food webs fig 26.7 Some energy ingested is lost at each successive trophic level Much goes to heat production, some lost for digestion and work Less than 10% goes toward growth and reproduction Experimental studies of freshwater ecosystem fig 26.8 For each 1000 calories of energy fixed by photosynthesizers 150 calories transferred to small heterotrophs 30 calories of that transferred to smelt 6 calories of that transferred to trout (or humans) 1.2 calories from trout transferred to humans Organisms that have a vegetarian diet have more food energy available There are more individuals at lower trophic levels than at upper levels Diagrammatic representations of such relationships form pyramids fig 26.9 Biomass pyramids may occasionally be inverted Energy pyramids cannot be inverted ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION Succession: Ecosystems Have a Tendency to Change from Simple to Complex Cleared land becomes occupied by larger and more diverse plants Small pond becomes filled with vegetation encroaching from the edges Types of Succession Secondary succession Occurs in areas once exhibiting life but disturbed in some manner Frequently initiated by humans Also result from fires or by abandoning agricultural fields fig 26.10 Primary succession Occurs in areas devoid of all life Areas after retreat of glaciers New volcanic islands Xerarch succession occurs on dry, barren rocks Hydrarch succession occurs in open water Oligotrophic lake is poor-in nutrients Eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients Oligotrophic lake may become eutrophic through succession Climax vegetation (climax community) Characteristic vegetation may be associated with climate of region fig 26.11 Term no longer useful as once presumed Climates keep changing Process of succession is very slow Nature of a region`s vegetation affected by human activities General Characteristics of Succession Increase in total biomass, decrease in net productivity Earlier stages more productive than later ones Agricultural systems not allowed to mature, productivity kept high More species in mature ecosystems than in immature ecosystems Number of heterotrophs increases faster than number of autotrophs Organisms at later stages are more specialized than earlier organisms [Return to Chapter 26 Page] [Return to Chapter Tools Page] [Return to Biology Home Page] Search | How to Order | E-mail

-->",0.5965302586555481],["Biomass Hinterland Some cities are situated and sited better than others to take advantage of natural resources, but all depend on hinterlands, areas surrounding the city from which resources are drawn Areas with rich agricultural hinterlands supported the growth of cities Today, hinterlands extend much further Cities may draw on natural resources great distances from where they are located Impacts on Hinterland Creation of the hinterland disturbs natural ecosystems Farming removed native vegetation (forest cover, for example) and replaced it with selected plants Disrupted nutrient cycles (declining soil fertility) Deteriorated soil structure Removed wildlife habitat Altered hydrologic cycle (increased runoff and percolation) Polluted water and air If impacts was severe enough, it could threaten the life of the city (fertile crescent) Modern Impacts on Hinterland Despite the apparent impacts of farming on the natural environment, it pales in comparison to the impacts of the modern city on surrounding areas Industrial revolution increased the amount of energy required and waste generated in the city Industrial revolution was also a chemical revolution On the farm, increased use of inorganic fertilizers Loss of biodiversity with introduction of hybrid crops In industry, new chemical compounds and high concentrations placed new threats on ecosystems Growing Hinterland The new economy and increasing size of cities expanded the size of the hinterland Technological revolutions, especially in transportation, allowed the import of materials (and export of waste) further and further away from cities Today it is very difficult to delineate an urban hinterland Consider, for example, where your next meal originated, or what materials were required to make your clothes Ecological Footprint Despite the difficulty in defining a hinterland, it is important that we be able to define the geographical impact of cities on the world In terms of land, they clearly take up little space (in the US, 75 percent of the population lives on 2 percent of the land) But the amount of land required to support a city is clearly much greater Support includes both inputs and outputs (a city could not exist unless it had somewhere to dump its garbage, for example) One way we can measure the amount of space necessary to support a city is to measure its ecological footprint Ecological Footprint The ecological footprint concept tries to measure how much nature people consume Calculates the number of acres required to support a population the ecological footprint of any defined population (from a single individual to a whole city or country) is the total area of ecologically productive land and water occupied exclusively to produce all the resources consumed and to assimilate all the wastes generated by that population, using prevailing technology.",0.594982385635376],["Human population of United States 243,000,000 Number of Human

Agriculture, Environment, and People Presented At An Inaugural Symposium for the George Bush Presidential Library Center on Agriculture and Sustainable Development: China and Its Trading Partners January 16, 1998 Neville P. Clarke* Coordinator, The impact Assessment Group The Texas A&amp;M University System *Director Emeritus The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station The Agriculture Program The Texas A&amp;M University System Introduction Purposes of the Symposium Describe the metamorphosis occurring in China and its Pacific Rim Partners in agriculture and sustainable development Define issues and opportunities relevant to enhancing China's sustainable development: food production resource management environmental protection rural development Explore Intra and Interregional Alliance on Food, Energy, Environment, Economics and Population (FEEEP) via the Asia Pacific Economic Commission Linking China's Sustainable Development Agenda to the FEEEP Alliance Defining appropriate political goals Establishing explicit linked objectives and actions between partners Establishing relative priorities and benefits assessments Understanding interrelationships among the complex factors at play Extending or developing methods to plan and evaluate specific actions Assessing the Impact of Change: An Approach to Integrated Planning for the FEEEP Alliance Change in China's agriculture and sustainable development may be driven by: Policy or regulation Introduction of new technology or knowledge Modifications in Trade and Investment Externalities such as weather Assessing the impact of these forces which create change: Requires understanding complex, often non-obvious, interactions Links and interrelates change from the farm to global level Suggests a holistic approach involving interactive economic, environmental, and social models The Texas A&amp;M Impact Assessment Group A versatile multidimensional and holistic approach Builds on existing regional and national models and data Adaptable to multiple uses One of the implementation tools for the FEEEP Alliance A framework for implementing China's Agriculture and Sustainable Development Agenda General Conclusions and Assumptions Derived From This Symposium Overarching Principles The relationship between people, food and environment is established Linkages between local, regional, and global geographic levels are critical Economic development is a necessary priority in the \ndeveloping world Sustainable development: the longer term agenda Both common and separate agendas of the Asia Pacific Nations The Centrality of Agriculture in the China and FEEEP Agenda A major engine of economic development Consumes and replenishes natural resources Sustains and enhances the quality of life Source of renewable energy The Winds of Change for China's Agriculture and Sustainable Development Political Population Economic Environmental Food - health - well being Factors Affecting Change Policy and regulation Research and technology Trade and Investment Externalities (weather, demographic shift, e.g.) Implementing An Action Plan for Enhancing Agriculture and Sustainable Development in China and Among Its APEC Partners: Requirements for Implementation Setting the Agenda Evaluating and Prioritizing the Options for Action Defining Benefits and Determining Costs Measuring and Monitoring the Consequences of Actions Taken Facilitating Adoption and Implementation Rationale for A Georeferenced, Multidimensional, Holistic Approach to Planning and Evaluating the FEEEP Agenda Spatial Dimensions of Change for Agricultural Production and Sustainable Development Agricultural decisions and consequences are ultimately local Geographic diversity and site specificity are inherent in agricultural production Agriculture includes the range of intensive to extensive production methods Population and other Non-agricultural geographic factors often influence agricultural production locations Plans and decisions on policy target regional and national goals but have local results Regional and global agendas address common goals between and among nations THEREFORE: Enlightened decision-making requires the ability to transcend the spatial dimensions of change - to predict the impact of factors affecting change from local to global levels Spatial Dimensions of Economic Change from Agriculture Changes in productivity begin at the farm level Economic and market policy and reform exert their impact from farm level to regions/nations New technology and knowledge does not result in geographically uniform adoption and impact Supply and demand drive prices at multiple geographic levels Economically driven management decisions cause interactions between commodities in terms of quantities produced and prices across geographic regions Markets are globally interdependent THEREFORE: Models linking household, provincial, national, regional and global effects are needed to describe economic impact of forces that drive change Environmental Dimensions of Change for Agriculture and Sustainable Development Production Practices using natural resources begin at the farm/household level Geographic diversity and site specificity moderate the environmental impact of change from agriculture and forestry Air, soil, and water consequences of agriculture are often manifest across political boundaries Environmental consequences of change are often defined at the level of landscapes and watersheds Related processing and manufacturing from agricultural and forest products may originate at points, but effects are often geographically distributed THEREFORE: models are needed which project the environmental consequences of economically driven decisions at multiple geographic levels of resolution Social Dimensions of Change for Agriculture and Sustainable Development Social mores and farmer &quot;wisdom&quot; moderate the adoption of new technology and other factors creating change Risk aversion often overrides goals of enhanced productivity Short term survival at the household level often overrides longer term goals of sustainable production of food and fiber New technology and changes in policy are often not &quot;size neutral&quot; - and, &quot;one size does not fit all&quot; Agriculture and its environmental consequences are influenced by population, transportation, and availability of labor resources Factors intended to create regional or national change, such as policy and new technology, may impact people, households, and communities in non-obvious ways THEREFORE: Methods to predict and assess the social consequences of economically and socially driven change are necessary to address the sustainable development agenda at multiple levels of geographic resolution Summary: Interactions of Forces Creating Change and Their Impact on People, Food and Environment All elements of the following matrix are interactive Actions Consequences Spatial Relationships Policy or Regulation Economic Farm or Household New Technology Environmental Province or State Trade and Investment Social National or Regional Externalities Global Implications Outcomes are often complex and sometimes not obvious Interactions must be considered in predicting consequences Results pertain to public, private, and multinational investments A holistic multidimensional approach to impact assessment is necessary The Texas A&amp;M Approach: Assessing the Impact of Change Context and Rationale: Relating The Texas A&amp;M Capability to the China and FEEEP Agendas From the previous analysis it can be concluded that implementing an agenda for agriculture and sustainable development in China with linkage to the emerging FEEEP agenda requires a multidimensional georeferenced framework for strategic planning and evaluation, supported by appropriate interrelated models, data bases and analytic techniques The Texas A&amp;M methodology is being developed to meet this class of need in the context of Texas, U.S., and international scenarios The methodology is highly versatile and flexible and can serve as the needed framework The framework readily accommodates models, databases, information from multiple sources and organizes them in a georeferenced context for ready access and utilization Purpose of the Impact Assessment Group Comprehensive Capability to Assess the Utility or Consequences of Change Economic, Environmental and Societal Impacts Forecasting (ex ante) and Evaluation (ex poste) Holistic Approach with Interactive Models GIS Based Framework for Spatially Explicit Analysis Resource for Advocacy and Evaluation of the Products of The Agriculture Program Development of Team Texas A&amp;M --",0.4847128689289093],["Human population of United States: 243,000,000 Number of Human beings who could be fed by the grain and soybeans eaten by U.

Benefits of Organic Farming by Mark Ruskell and Caroline Hoffman A definition of ORGANIC (from the international Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements): To produce food of high nutritional value in sufficient quality To work with natural systems rather than seeking to dominate them To encourage and enhance biological cycles within the farming system, involving micro-organisms, soil flora and fauna, plants and animals To maintain and increase the long-term fertility of soils To use as far as possible renewable resources in locally organised agricultural systems To work as much as possible within a closed system with regard to organic matter and nutrient elements To give all livestock conditions of life that allow them to perform all aspects of their innate behaviour To avoid all forms of pollution that may result from agricultural techniques To maintain the genetic diversity of the agricultural system and its surrounding, including the protection of plant and wildlife habitats To allow agricultural producers an adequate return and satisfaction from their work including a safe working environment To consider the wider social and ecological impact of the farming system Research evidence shows conclusively that organic farming is beneficial to the ENVIRONMENT as BIODIVERSITY has been increased by organic farming techniques.",0.446444571018219],["atal H&uuml;y&uuml;k near

major economic functions large complexes of storage rooms, apparently for agricultural produce apparently used to support hundreds of laborers and craft specialists associated with the temple the first examples of writing (pre-cuneiform) are from the Eanna temple precinct and they clearly have to do with accounting of goods in storage, payments, lists of workers, and so on implications of temples, ziggurats, etc. these are really big, elaborate, expensive buildings even by today's standards required a huge labor force to build required skill in planning the building and organizing logistics repeated rebuildings imply that this level of organization and use of resources was an ongoing feature of society, not an unusual result of some extraordinarily talented leader or unique circumstances all suggest: an institutionalized, stable hierarchy that is, not just one successful, charismatic leader, but a society organized around there being a powerful leader, generation after generation mobilization of large economic resources organization of many laborers and craftspeople legitimation of institutions through association with impressive monuments and ceremonies presence of architects, specialized planner-organizers: a &quot;knowledge&quot; class that is, people with &quot;esoteric&quot; knowledge possibly with formal training or apprenticeship probably with control of access to knowledge and skills the buildings and the institutions would have lent a permanence and legitimacy to this class the storage, production, and administrative features suggest a major role of the temple in the flow of agricultural produce the direction of at least some of the labor of much of the population the training and support of specialized craftspeople the training and support of specialized administrators, including eventually scribes all together, the temple seems to have been the institution around and through which a complex social hierarchy and real political and economic

bulges can't keep up with the earth's rotation (1000 MPH) because of their slow speed (450 MPH) and blocking by continents Ocean basins with a natural 12 or 24 hour resonance have high tidal ranges Large ocean basins have rotary tides (circle around a point) Chapter 14: Ocean Waters Ocean Water Origin and Composition Water--H 2 0, polar molecule causes surface tension and high heat capacity Water derived from volcanic volatiles and cometary collisions with Earth Ocean water well mixed, interacts with atmosphere, seafloor, and land Color blue or green because these wavelengths penetrate the deepest Dissolved gasses--more oxygen near surface, more carbon dioxide at depth Nutrients--depleted at surface (removed by organisms which then die &amp; sink) Salinity--typically about 35 , mostly chlorine (19.4 ) and sodium (10.8 ) Density--increases with decreasing temperature &amp; increasing salinity Thermocline--temperature profile caused by solar radiation and water density Thermocline creates the SOFAR channel which confines sound waves Surface (horizontal) Circulation (relatively fast) Driven by surface winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) Controlled by

Eddies south of Gulf Stream Spin clockwise Spin counterclockwise Warm water cores Cold water cores Stay at surface Sink deep Low in nutrients &amp; life High in nutrients &amp; life Deep (vertical) Circulation (very slow) Driven by differences in water density (due to temperature and salinity) Vertical circulation is often blocked by the thermocline Deep upwelling near poles, shallow upwelling
