Water is one of the few that can become a liquid, solid, and gas. For example, if you were to put an ice cube, a solid, outside on a hot day, it would turn to water, a liquid. If you were to boil that water, it would turn into steam, which is a gas. Then, during condensation, the gas is turned into a liquid. Freezing a liquid to a solid can be more rapid if the water is hot than when it is warm because of the rapid evaporation. Sublimation is where heat enters a solid to change the molecule bonding, turning the solid into a gas. All of these substances have the same composition, they just have a different form. Phase change depends on the temperature and the amount of pressure exerted on it, also usually involving a transfer of energy. Physical change and chemical change are the two different types of phase changes. Chemical change is when the composition of a substance changes. An example of chemical change is when a leaf changes color in the fall. A physical change is when only the form of the substance changes. A cloud is made through phase change by warm air rising and expanding. It then cools while expanding and water vapor molecules collide together and stick",2.573568820953369],["Phase changes in normal matter — when a gas condenses into a liquid or a liquid freezes to a solid — are well understood.",2.558748722076416],["Changes of state involve a solid melting, a liquid freezing, a liquid boiling or a gas condensing.",2.558748722076416],["Changes of state involve a solid melting, a liquid freezing, a liquid boiling or a gas condensing.",2.558748722076416],["For example , water remains water , no matter if it solid , liquid or gas .",2.5413856506347656],["For example, water remains water, no matter if it solid, liquid or gas.",2.5413856506347656],["Water, for example, can exist as a solid (ice), a liquid (water) or a gas (steam).",2.5413856506347656],["For example, water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid, or gas (water vapor).",2.5413856506347656],["Water, for example, can exist as a liquid, as a solid [ice], and as a gas [water vapor].",2.5413856506347656],["Take water for example: It converts from liquid (water) to gas (steam) at 100C.",2.5413856506347656],["For example, water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid, or gas (water vapor).",2.5413856506347656],["Seltzer water and ammonia water are two good examples of solutions of a gas in a liquid.",2.5413856506347656],["For example: In the context of watershed management, the gas is water vapor and the liquid is water.",2.5413856506347656],["Water, for example, can exist as a solid (ice), a liquid (water) or a gas (steam).",2.5413856506347656],["Water, for example, can exist as a liquid, as a solid [ice], and as a gas [water vapor].",2.5413856506347656],["Examples of Gas to Liquid (Condensation)   Water vapor to dew - Water vapor turns from a gas into a liquid, such as dew on the morning grass.",2.5351204872131348],["Examples of Gas to Liquid ( Condensation )   Water vapor to dew - Water vapor turns from a gas into a liquid , such as dew on the morning grass .",2.5351204872131348],["as water changes from one form to another (liquid to gas, gas to liquid, liquid to solid, etc.) there is an associated transfer of energy.",2.529301881790161],["Water Liquid to Water Gas:",2.5260791778564453],["Water Liquid to Water Gas:",2.5260791778564453]]
