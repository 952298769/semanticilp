No, it's not President Bush or his wife.  It's their family dog, Millie.  It has been learned that Millie plans to write her life story and tell how she became \"First Dog.\"  Millie was born on a Kentucky farm.  She is a two-year-old English springer spaniel.  Millie has spent much of the past few years begging for table scraps from the Bush grandchildren.  Not long ago, she became a mother of six.  Her puppies have now grown old enough to leave home.  Since Millie had free time, she needed a hobby.  Mrs. Bush thought that writing would be just the thing.  Because Millie's paws don't hold a pen very well, Mrs. Bush has promised to write down the words for her.  She will most likely share some White House secrets.  Some think that Millie will tell what song the President likes to sing while he works in the Oval Office.  Others think she will tell about the time she saw Lincoln's ghost.  It remains to be seen whether Millie will be a dog-gone good writer.","id":"rm4-29","title":"First Dog Will Write Life Story"},{"qas":[{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"Doctor Continues"},{"candidateText":"Doctor Continues to Find Cures (DENVER, 1951)."},{"candidateText":"Doctor"},{"candidateText":"Doctor Continues to Find Cures"}],"question":"Who is Dr. Florence Sabin?","id":"rm4-3q1","correctAnswers":[{"answerText":"a scientist and doctor who finds cures for illness"}]},{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"TB cases in half in Denver.

The men are John Kennedy and Richard Nixon.  They are going to be on TV together four different times.  Each man will tell what he will do if he is elected.  This is the first time such a talk has been shown on TV.  It is called a debate.  People who run for office often take part in a debate, but never on TV.  The two men will stand on a stage.  Reporters will ask them many questions.  They will have 2 1\/2 minutes to answer each question.  The questions will be about subjects such as how to spend our country's money and how to keep our country safe.  The talks are being called the \"Great Debates.\" Each one will last for one hour.  The shows will be watched by about 70 million people.  This will help citizens make up their minds about how to vote.  The voting will take place in early November.","id":"rm4-14","title":"First TV Debates To Take Place"},{"qas":[{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"their rulers?

The people of France removed the king and queen from power.  The citizens chose to be free and to vote for their leaders.  To the French, July 14 has the same meaning as July 4th does to the United States.  Why did the French people turn against their rulers?  They were unhappy with their lives.  The winter months had been very cold.  Many poor people didn't have homes, so they lived on the streets.  They built fires to keep warm.  Food was hard to find, and taxes were high.  But in the palace, the king and queen were warm and well-fed.  When the queen was told about the poor, she did not feel sorry for them.  Instead, she laughed and said they should eat cake for food.  This upset the citizens.  So, one night, the people stormed the palace.  They took the king and queen to prison where they died.  In their place, the people chose new leaders.  Since that time, the citizens have voted for their leaders.  This day will be marked by parades and singing.  Fireworks will light the sky.  The French enjoy their freedom just as we in the United States do.","id":"rm4-12","title":"France Celebrates Freedom"},{"qas":[{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"Man Want"},{"candidateText":"Man Want To Build Space Machine"},{"candidateText":"Man Want To Build Space Machine (NEW YORK, March 7, 1921).

Take Robert H. Goddard, for example.  He is causing a great deal of fuss these days.  Goddard has a silly idea that he thinks will work. He says it is possible to make a machine that will fly in outer space.  Goddard calls his machine a \"rocket.\" He has never made one, but he has written about it.  He believes that someday a rocket can travel to the moon.  It is true that a few years ago, people laughed at the idea that man could fly.  Then the Wright Brothers flew the first airplane.  But a plane needs air to fly.  In outer space, there is no air.  Even an airplane can't work in outer space.  That is why everyone knows that a rocket certainly could not make the long trip.  Still, Goddard keeps working on his idea.  In 1914, he received a patent for his rocket. A patent is a piece of paper that gives the owner the right to make money from an idea. Goddard may have a patent, but he has yet to build a rocket and prove it can fly in space.   This newspaper thinks it's time that people like Goddard stop trying to fool the public. Most of the world's great machines have already been built.  Dreamers like Goddard should start building useful things that will help people.","id":"rm4-15","title":"Man Want To Build Space Machine"},{"qas":[{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"Japan has attacked U.S. sailors"},{"candidateText":"Japan"},{"candidateText":"Japan Attacks U.S."},{"candidateText":"Japan has attacked U.S. sailors in Hawaii an started a war!"}],"question":"Who attacked U.S. ships?","id":"rm4-28q1","correctAnswers":[{"answerText":"Japan"}]},{"candidates":[{"candidateText":"more damage.
