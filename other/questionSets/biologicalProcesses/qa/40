    The red blood cells of people with sickle-cell disease become distorted in shape, or sickled, under low-oxygen conditions (see Figure 5.21), as occurs in the capillaries. These sickled cells can clump together and block the flow of blood in the capillaries, resulting in serious damage to organs such as the kidney, heart, and brain.
