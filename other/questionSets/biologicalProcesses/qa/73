    How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other organic molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it. The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (Figure 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution. By receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized when it is reduced to NADH. The name NADH shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose.
