    In E. coli, a pilus of the donor cell attaches to the recipient (Figure 27.12). The pilus then retracts, pulling the two cells together, much like a grappling hook. The next step is thought to be the formation of a temporary &quot;mating bridge&quot; between the two cells, through which the donor may transfer DNA to the recipient.
