    When hybrids are less fit than members of their parent species, as in the Bombina example, we might expect natural selection to strengthen prezygotic barriers to reproduction, thus reducing the formation of unfit hybrids. Because this process involves reinforcing reproductive barriers, it is called reinforcement. If reinforcement is occurring, a logical prediction is that barriers to reproduction between species should be stronger for sympatric populations than for allopatric populations.
