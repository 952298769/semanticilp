    When the cell is stimulated, gated channels open that facilitate Na+ diffusion. Sodium ions then &quot;fall&quot; down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and by the attraction of these cations to the negative side (inside) of the membrane.

        What would happen without the concentration gradient of Na+ and the attraction of these cations to the negative side of the membrane?
      </q>
      <a0>
        sodium ions would not &quot;fall&quot; down their electrochemical gradient
      </a0>
      <a1>Gated channels would not open</a1>
