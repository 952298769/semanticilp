    Genome-wide expression studies are made possible by DNA microarray assays. A DNA microarray consists of tiny amounts of a large number of single-stranded DNA fragments representing different genes fixed to a glass slide in a tightly spaced array, or grid (see Figure 20.1). (The microarray is also called a DNA chip by analogy to a computer chip. ) Ideally, these fragments represent all the genes of an organism. Figure 20.15 outlines how the DNA fragments on a microarray are tested for hybridization with cDNA molecules that have been prepared from the mRNAs in particular cells of interest and labeled with fluorescent dyes.
