    Gel electrophoresis separates macromolecules on the basis of their rate of movement through an agarose gel in an electric field: The distance a DNA molecule travels is inversely proportional to its length. A mixture of DNA molecules, usually fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion (cutting) or PCR amplification, is separated into bands. Each band contains thousands of molecules of the same length. Results After the current is turned off, a DNA-binding dye (ethidium bromide) is added. This dye fluoresces pink in ultraviolet light, revealing the separated bands to which it binds.
