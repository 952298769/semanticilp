    The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is especially useful for detailed study of the topography of a specimen (see Figure 6.3). The electron beam scans the surface of the sample, usually coated with a thin film of gold. The beam excites electrons on the surface, and these secondary electrons are detected by a device that translates the pattern of electrons into an electronic signal to a video screen. The result is an image of the specimen's surface that appears three-dimensional.
