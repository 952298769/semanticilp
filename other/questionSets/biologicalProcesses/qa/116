    The binding of a specific signaling molecule to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the chain of molecular interactions: the signal transduction pathway: that leads to a particular response within the cell. Like falling dominoes, the signal-activated receptor activates another molecule, which activates yet another molecule, and so on, until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated.
