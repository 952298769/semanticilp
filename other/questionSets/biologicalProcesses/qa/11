    A sudden change in the environment, such as a fire or flood, may drastically reduce the size of a population. A severe drop in population size can cause the bottleneck effect, so named because the population has passed through a &quot;bottleneck&quot; that reduces its size (Figure 23.10). By chance alone, certain alleles may be overrepresented among the survivors, others may be underrepresented, and some may be absent altogether. Ongoing genetic drift is likely to have substantial effects on the gene pool until the population becomes large enough that chance events have less impact.
