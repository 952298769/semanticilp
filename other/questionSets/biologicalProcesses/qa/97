    Soil-dwelling bacteria called myxobacteria (&quot;slime bacteria&quot;) use chemical signals to share information about nutrient availability. When food is scarce, starving cells secrete a molecule that stimulates neighboring cells to aggregate. The cells form a structure, called a fruiting body, that produces thick-walled spores capable of surviving until the environment improves.
