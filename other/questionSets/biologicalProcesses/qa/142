    In some cases, small changes in regulatory sequences of particular genes cause changes in gene expression patterns that can lead to major changes in body form. For example, the differing patterns of expression of the Hox genes along the body axis in insects and crustaceans can explain the variation in number of leg-bearing segments among these segmented animals (Figure 21.19).
