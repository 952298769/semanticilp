    Analysis of hummingbird beta-globin gene expression with RT-PCR begins similarly to Northern blotting, with the isolation of mRNAs from different developmental stages of hummingbird embryos. Reverse transcriptase is added next to make cDNA, which then serves as a template for PCR amplification using primers from the beta-globin gene. When the products are run on a gel, copies of the amplified region will be observed as bands only in samples that originally contained the beta-globin mRNA.
