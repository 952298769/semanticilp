    The first type are transposons, which move within a genome by means of a DNA intermediate. Transposons can move by a &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; mechanism, which removes the element from the original site, or by a &quot;copy-and-paste&quot; mechanism, which leaves a copy behind (Figure 21.9). Both mechanisms require an enzyme called transposase, which is generally encoded by the transposon.
