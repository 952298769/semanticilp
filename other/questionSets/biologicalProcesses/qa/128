    All species can produce more offspring than their environment can support (Figure 22.11), and many of these offspring fail to survive and reproduce. Inference #1: Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals. Inference #2: This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to the accumulation of favorable traits in the population over generations.
