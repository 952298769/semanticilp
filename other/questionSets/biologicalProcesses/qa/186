    Restriction fragment analysis can be used to compare two different DNA molecules: for example, two alleles of a gene: if the nucleotide difference affects a restriction site. A change in even one base pair of that sequence will prevent a restriction enzyme from cutting there. Variations in DNA sequence among a population are called polymorphisms (from the Greek for many forms), and this particular type of sequence change is called a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP, pronounced Rif-lip). If one allele contains a RFLP, digestion with the enzyme that recognizes the site will produce a different mixture of fragments for each of the two alleles. Each mixture will give its own band pattern in gel electrophoresis.
