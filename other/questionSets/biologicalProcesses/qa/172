    &amp;#x278B; Both the plasmid and the hummingbird DNA are cut with the same restriction enzyme, and then &amp;#x278C; the fragments are mixed together, allowing base pairing between their complementary sticky ends. We then add DNA ligase, which covalently bonds the sugar-phosphate backbones of the fragments whose sticky ends have base-paired.

      <q>What would happen without sticky ends?</q>
      <a0>
        DNA ligase would covalently bond the sugar-phosphate backbones of the fragments
