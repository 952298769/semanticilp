    Histamine released at sites of damage triggers nearby blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. Activated macrophages and neutrophils discharge cytokines, signaling molecules that enhance an immune response. These cytokines promote blood flow to the site of injury or infection. The increase in local blood supply causes the redness and increased skin temperature typical of the inflammatory response. Blood-engorged capillaries leak fluid into neighboring tissues, causing swelling. During inflammation, cycles of signaling and response transform the site. Activated complement proteins promote further release of histamine, attracting more phagocytic cells that enter injured tissues (see Figure 43.8) and carry out additional phagocytosis. At the same time, enhanced blood flow to the site helps deliver antimicrobial peptides. The result is an accumulation of pus, a fluid rich in white blood cells, dead pathogens, and cell debris from damaged tissue.
