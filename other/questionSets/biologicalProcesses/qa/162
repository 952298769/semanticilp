    The amount of atmospheric O2 increased gradually from about 2.7 to 2.3 billion years ago, but then shot up relatively rapidly to between 1% and 10% of its present level (Figure 25.8). This &quot;oxygen revolution&quot; had an enormous impact on life. In certain of its chemical forms, oxygen attacks chemical bonds and can inhibit enzymes and damage cells. As a result, the rising concentration of atmospheric O2 probably doomed many prokaryotic groups.
