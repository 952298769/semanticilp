    The initial signaling molecule, a local regulator called a growth factor, triggers a phosphorylation cascade, as in Figure 11.10. (The ATP molecules and phosphate groups are not shown.) Once phosphorylated, the last kinase in the sequence enters the nucleus and there activates a gene-regulating protein, a transcription factor. This protein stimulates transcription of a specific gene (or genes). The resulting mRNA then directs the synthesis of a particular protein in the cytoplasm.
