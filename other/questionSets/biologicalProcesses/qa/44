    The two regions, one on each X chromosome, associate briefly with each other in each cell at an early stage of embryonic development. Then one of the genes, called XIST (for X-inactive specific transcript) becomes active only on the chromosome that will become the Barr body. Multiple copies of the RNA product of this gene apparently attach to the X chromosome on which they are made, eventually almost covering it. Interaction of this RNA with the chromosome seems to initiate X inactivation, and the RNA products of other genes nearby on the X chromosome help to regulate the process.
