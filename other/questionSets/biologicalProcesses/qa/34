    The ribosome holds the tRNA and mRNA in close proximity and positions the new amino acid for addition to the carboxyl end of the growing polypeptide. It then catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond. As the polypeptide becomes longer, it passes through an exit tunnel in the ribosome's large subunit. When the polypeptide is complete, it is released through the exit tunnel.
